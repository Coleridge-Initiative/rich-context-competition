Summary
Background and objectives We examined the distribution of estimated GFR (eGFR) in a healthy cohort of
adolescents to inform clinical and research use.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements Various creatinine-based (n  3256) and/or cystatin C­based
(n  811) equations, including the recently developed complete and bedside equations from the Chronic
Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study, were applied to U.S. adolescents 12 to 17 years of age participat-
ing in the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Results The median serum creatinine and cystatin C were 0.7 mg/dl and 0.83 mg/L, respectively. The dis-
tribution of eGFR varied widely, with the median GFR ranging from a low of 96.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(CKiD) to a high of 140.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (original Schwartz). The proportions of participants with
eGFRs 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 are as follows: bedside CKiD 8.9%, Counahan 6.3%, Leger 0.4%, original
Schwartz 0%, Filler 1.3%, Grubb 3.1%, Bouvet 2.5%, CKiD 1.8%, and Zappitelli 5.6%. By any equation ex-
amined, no group of participants with eGFR 10th percentile had an increased prevalence of comorbid
conditions consistent with a low measured GFR.
Conclusions Most pediatric-specific GFR estimating equations resulted in 25% to 50% of the participants
having an eGFR 100 ml/min per 1.73 m2. However, participants with eGFR in the lower ranges did not
have an increased prevalence of morbidities associated with chronic kidney disease. Clinical validation of
creatinine- or cystatin C­based estimated GFRs in healthy children is needed before it is possible to screen
the general population for chronic kidney disease.

Introduction
Accurate estimation of kidney function in children is
important from a clinical, research, and public health
perspective. From a clinical standpoint, the most com-
monly used marker of kidney function, serum creat-
inine, varies by body size, sex, and race, and given the
wide range of maturation of skeletal muscle and
growth observed in the pediatric population, recog-
nition of abnormal creatinine values is more challeng-
ing (1­4). Estimation of GFR may aid in the identifi-
cation and management of acute and chronic kidney
injury, including facilitation of appropriate fluid and
medication dosing. The international epidemic of
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults mandates re-
search and public health interventions to identify
CKD and slow its development and progression, and
estimation of GFR is integral to these efforts (5,6).
Likely because it is relatively rare, the prevalence of
CKD in the general population of children and ado-
lescents has not been extensively examined. As prior
longitudinal studies of kidney disease progression
have suggested that the overall rate of decline in GFR
in adults with CKD is approximately 3 to 5 ml/min
per year, some adults presenting with advanced CKD
or ESRD may have developed early stages of CKD in
childhood or adolescence (7,8). Given this, and the
striking increased incidence of CKD risk factors such
as hypertension and obesity in children and adoles-
cents over the past few decades, examining GFR and
CKD in the general pediatric population is worth-
while (9­12).
Serum creatinine and cystatin C are convenient
markers of kidney function. As in adults, GFR esti-
mating equations incorporating creatinine and/or
cystatin C have been developed for children over the
past 4 decades that attempt to account for the influ-
ence of age, body size, and/or sex on these markers,
thus improving accuracy. But the limitations of these
equations must be recognized. First, the laboratory
methods to determine creatinine and cystatin C have
changed over time, and thus estimating equations
using creatinine or cystatin C derived from a different
laboratory method may yield different, and less accu-
rate, results (4,13­15). Second, the equations were de-
veloped in small groups of children, primarily with
decreased GFR. GFR estimating equations in adults,

also primarily developed in populations with decreased
GFR, have been shown to underestimate GFR among those
without kidney disease (16­18). Limited studies have ex-
amined pediatric GFR estimating equations in the general
population (19).
To allow for appropriate clinical and research applica-
tion, we aimed to examine the distribution of GFRs ob-
tained from several creatinine- and/or cystatin C­based
pediatric GFR estimating equations in a large sample of
adolescents from the general U.S. population included
within the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). Among adolescents with lower esti-
mated GFR (eGFR), we looked for evidence of morbidities
that are commonly associated with decreased GFR to sup-
port a potential diagnosis of CKD.
Materials and Methods
Study Setting and Population
The National Center for Health Statistics, within the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has
been conducting the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) to assess the health and nutri-
tional status of the adults and children in the United States
since the 1960s. In 1999, the survey became a continuous
program and data has been released in 2-year increments
since 2002. NHANES uses a complex multistage sample
design to obtain a representative sample of the U.S. civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population of all ages. The
NHANES study protocols were approved by the institu-
tional review board of the National Center for Health
Statistics. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants or, if younger than 18 years, their guardians.
Assent was obtained from those aged 7 to 17 years. The
overall participation rate for NHANES 1999­2002 (inter-
viewed and examined sample) was 78%.
NHANES routinely collects serum for biochemistry
analyses, including serum creatinine, in those aged 12
years and older. For this analysis, we examined adoles-
cents aged 12 to 17 years within NHANES 1999­2002
because serum cystatin C measures were also available in
these project years. Of the 3732 adolescents aged 12 to 17
years in NHANES 1999­2002, 467 were missing serum
creatinine values. Among those with serum creatinine
measures, 29 were missing height and/or weight, resulting
in a final creatinine subsample of 3256 adolescents. In 2006,
stored surplus serum was used to assay cystatin C in a 25%
random sample of participants aged 12 years and older
and in all participants with a serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dl
in boys and 1.0 mg/dl in girls (20). Among the 818
participants 12 to 17 years old with serum cystatin C
measures, 7 had missing height and/or weight, resulting
in a final cystatin C subsample of 811. Of this subsample, 6
boys and 2 girls had high serum creatinine as defined
above.
Kidney Function Measures
Serum creatinine was measured by the modified kinetic
Jaffe
´ reaction using an Hitachi 917 analyzer. The assay
range (without dilution) was 0.1 to 25.0 mg/dl. Interassay
coefficients of variation for the assay were 4.4% and 1.1% at
mean concentrations of 0.68 and 7.08 mg/dl, respectively.
Recognizing the lack of standardization in measurement of
serum creatinine in many laboratories, the National Kid-
ney Disease Education Program (NKDEP) is attempting to
have all laboratories standardize to a "gold standard" ref-
erence method (14). NHANES, via the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation laboratory, analyzes serum creatinine in stored
serum for each 2-year data release using a Roche coupled
enzymatic assay performed on a Roche P Module instru-
ment. Creatinine measures from this "gold standard" en-
zymatic assay are then compared with creatinine measures
obtained via the traditional modified Jaffe
´ reaction used in
NHANES, and if a significant difference exists, a regres-
sion is recommended to correct the NHANES creatinine.
For 1999­2000, results of this comparison led NHANES to
recommend a correction for serum creatinine according to
the following equation: corrected creatinine (Y)  1.013 
NHANES creatinine (X)  0.147 (r  0.984). No correction
was recommended for 2001­2002 (21).
Serum cystatin C was measured at the Cleveland Clinic
Research Laboratory using a particle-enhanced immuno-
nephelometric assay (PENIA, Dade Behring N Latex Cys-
tatin C run on a Dade Behring Nephelometer II; Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, Illinois) (22). The assay
range was 0.23 to 7.25 mg/L. Interassay coefficients of
variation for the assay were 5.05% and 4.87% at mean
concentrations of 0.97 and 1.90 mg/L, respectively.
GFR was estimated using the creatinine and/or cystatin
C-based equations listed in Table 2 (23­31). eGFRs from the
formulas by Leger and Bouvet et al. (ml/min) were stan-
dardized to 1.73 m2 using body surface area determined by
the formula of Haycock et al. (32). The "gold standard"
GFR measurement used to develop the GFR estimating
equations, as well as the methods of creatinine and cystatin
C measurement, is included in this table.
Other Variables
Questionnaire information provided the participants'
age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated from the height and weight of each participant
(kg/m2). BMI percentiles were calculated based on the
CDC's BMI-for-age sex-specific growth charts and partici-
pants were categorized as obese if their BMI was 95th
percentile (33). Three to four BP determinations were taken
using a mercury sphygmomanometer using a technique
based on recommendations from the American Heart As-
sociation (34). The average systolic BP variable was used to
calculate BP percentiles (35). Non­first morning random
urine samples were analyzed for creatinine (Jaffe
´ rate re-
action, Beckman Synchron CX3 Clinical System; Beckman
Instruments, Brea, California) and albumin (fluorescence
immunoassay, Sequoia-Turner model 450 Fluorometer)
(36). Microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria were de-
fined as urine albumin levels exceeding 30 and 300 g/mg
of creatinine, respectively. Anemia was defined as having
a hemoglobin value below the 5th percentile for age and
sex (37). Serum phosphorus was dichotomized as 5.3
mg/dl (90th percentile for study population) versus 5.3
mg/dl. Serum bicarbonate was dichotomized as 21
meq/L (10th percentile for study population) versus 21
meq/L. Heights were converted to Z-scores based on
growth charts from the CDC (38).

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata sta-
tistical software, version 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station,
Texas). Survey commands were used to account for the
NHANES complex sampling design and special cystatin
C­specific sampling weights were used in all analyses
involving cystatin C (39). The statistical significance level
was set at   0.05. All statistical analyses were two-sided.
Demographic and clinical characteristics were stratified
by creatinine and cystatin C subsamples. The distributions
of creatinine, cystatin C, and GFRs derived from the vari-
ous estimating equations were determined. To examine for
an increased prevalence of morbidities potentially associ-
ated with CKD among those with lower eGFR, participants
were dichotomized by eGFR 10th percentile versus 10th
percentile. Tenth percentile cutoffs were specific to each
estimating equation. Primary analyses compared the mean
levels of BMI percentile, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ra-
tio, and systolic BP percentile by 10th percentile eGFR
cutoff, and secondary analyses compared prevalence of
height Z-scores  2, anemia, elevated serum phosphorus
(5.3 mg/dl), and decreased serum bicarbonate (21
meq/L). Finally, mean eGFR was examined by obesity
status, and percentile distribution of eGFR was compared
between the entire population, obese and nonobese.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar
among the creatinine and cystatin C subsamples from
NHANES (Table 1). Among the creatinine subsample,
17.0% were obese, 3.9% had systolic BP 95th percentile,
11.8% had microalbuminuria, 1.3% had macroalbuminuria,
and 3% were anemic.
Table 2 displays the various GFR estimating equations
used in this analysis, the size and description of the GFR
range of the population in which the equation was derived,
as well as the methods of measurement for creatinine,
cystatin C, and GFR. Table 3 shows the results of the
application of these GFR estimating equations to the
NHANES sample, displaying percentile distribution of cre-
atinine, cystatin C, and eGFR in a population-based sample
of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The median serum
creatinine was 0.7 mg/dl and the median cystatin C was
0.83 mg/L. The distribution of eGFR varied by estimating
equation, with the median GFR ranging from a low of 96.6
ml/min per 1.73 m2 (CKiD) to a high of 140.0 ml/min per
1.73 m2 (original Schwartz). Less than 1% of participants
had an eGFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The propor-
tions of participants with eGFRs 75 ml/min per 1.73
m2, the reporting cutoff used by pediatric eGFR calcu-
lators on the National Kidney Disease Education Pro-
gram (NKDEP) Web site (40), are as follows: bedside
CKiD 8.9%, Counahan 6.3%, Leger 0.4%, original
Schwartz 0%, Filler 1.3%, Grubb 3.1%, Bouvet 2.5%,
CKiD 1.8%, and Zappitelli 5.6%.
Table 4 shows the comparison of morbidities often asso-
ciated with CKD including mean BMI percentile, urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and systolic BP among the
lower tail of the eGFR distributions versus those 10th
percentile. Few significant differences in the means of each
variable were observed. For BMI, the bedside CKiD, Cou-
nahan, and Leger equations had significantly higher BMI
percentile means among those with lower GFR. There was
a nonsignificant trend toward higher urinary albumin-to-
creatinine ratios among those with lower eGFR by every
equation. No significant differences were observed in sys-
tolic BP by eGFR category. Those with eGFR 10th per-
centile were significantly more likely to be anemic than
those 10th percentile for all equations except by original

Schwartz. Similar trends were observed for bicarbonate
and phosphorus. Those with GFRs 10th percentile esti-
mated by the bedside CKiD, Counahan, Leger, Bouvet, and
CKiD equations were more likely to have low bicarbonate
than their counterparts with GFRs 10th percentile. Those
10th percentile estimated by the original Schwartz, bed-
side CKiD, Counahan, Leger, and CKiD formulas were
significantly more likely to have higher phosphorus levels
than their counterparts with GFRs 10th percentile. Fi-
nally, no significant differences in the likelihood of having
a height Z-score 2 were observed by the eGFR cutoff of
the 10th percentile for any equation except for that by
Bouvet (0% with eGFR 83.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2 had
height Z-score  2, compared with 1.7% for those with
GFR 83.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P  0.008). Therefore, by
any equation examined, participants in the lower GFR
group did not have an increased prevalence of comorbid
conditions consistent with CKD.
Although no consistent differences in mean BMI percen-
tile were observed among those with lower compared with
those with higher eGFR by any equation (Table 4), the
potential effect of the high prevalence of obesity in this
population on GFR adjusted for body surface area deserves
further analysis. Mean GFR among the obese (BMI 95th
percentile) and nonobese population was examined (Table 5).
The creatinine-based equation by Leger, the cystatin
C­based equations by Filler and Grubb, and the cystatin
C­ and creatinine-based equation by Zappitelli show sig-
nificantly lower mean eGFRs among the obese compared
with those among the nonobese. To examine if obesity was
affecting the distribution of eGFR, we compared the dis-
tribution of eGFR in the entire population to that dichoto-
mized as obese and nonobese using these select equations
(Table 6). Although eGFRs tend to be lower at every per-
centile cutoff among the obese compared with those
among the nonobese, the difference tends to be quite small,
particularly at the lower end of the distribution that is of
greatest interest. It is also noted that there is minimal
difference between the nonobese and the total population
distributions. Thus, obesity has an effect on the eGFR
distribution among some equations, but it does not appear
to be playing a significant role in lowering the eGFR dis-
tribution in the entire study population.
Discussion
The renal clearance of inulin has traditionally been con-
sidered the gold standard for the evaluation of GFR in
children and adults, and mean (SD) GFRs determined by
this method range from 115 (24) to 117.2 (16.1) ml/min per
1.73 m2 in young adults without kidney disease (4,41,42).
Formal GFR measurements were not performed for those
examined in this study, but given the rarity of CKD in the
general population of children and as morbidities that
commonly associate with CKD were not more prevalent
among those with lower eGFRs, it can be safely assumed
that most had normal kidney function. Despite this, in this
examination of teenagers selected from the general U.S.
population, most pediatric-specific GFR estimating equa-
tions resulted in 25 to 50% of the participants having an
eGFR 100 ml/min per 1.73 m2. On the basis of the normal
variation of GFR measured by inulin in studies of healthy
children, a portion of this population should be expected to
have GFR in the 70 to 99 ml/min per 1.73 m2 range.
However, the distribution observed in this study is skewed
toward lower eGFR beyond what is expected with normal
biologic variation. Bias of pediatric GFR estimating equa-
tions is also possible, and two potential explanations
should be considered: (1) serum creatinine/cystatin C lab-
oratory methods used by NHANES differed from the
method originally used to derive the estimating equation,
and (2) pediatric GFR estimating equations systematically
underestimate GFR because they were derived in children
with CKD.
The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Out-
comes Quality Initiative (NKF/DOQI) Clinical Practice
Guidelines, published in 2003, recommend that the formu-
las by Schwartz et al. or Counahan-Barratt et al. be used to
estimate GFR (24,26,27). Both formulas account for the
relationship between creatinine production and muscle
mass by using height as a surrogate. The differing con-
stants used in these formulas highlight the significant ef-
fect of the laboratory method for creatinine determination
on GFR estimating equations. The original Schwartz equa-
tion was derived using Jaffe
´ (alkaline picrate) creatinine
methodology, and the Counahan-Barratt using the Jaffe
´
reaction after serum adsorption onto an ion-exchange resin
to remove noncreatinine chromogens (4,24,26). If the same

laboratory method is used for creatinine determination, the
difference between the constants leads to a 22% and 39%
reduction in eGFR by the Counahan-Barratt compared
with the Schwartz equation in adolescent females and
males, respectively. The recently published GFR estimat-
ing equations from the CKiD Study were derived using
creatinines determined by an enzymatic assay that is more
specific and sensitive than the Jaffe
´ method (14,15,23).
Compared with the Jaffe
´ method, the enzymatic method
results in lower creatinine values; hence, the lower con-
stant in the bedside CKiD estimating equation, compared
with the original Schwartz equation, reflects this (13).
Differences in cystatin C assays and lack of standard
calibrators may also affect GFR estimation and the results
of this study. NHANES determined cystatin C using the
Dade Behring particle-enhanced nephelometric immuno-
assay (PENIA) method (22). The equations by Bouvet and
CKiD used a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoas-
say (PETIA) (43). Previous comparisons of these two assays
have shown that the PETIA method provided significantly
higher results compared with PENIA, and differences in
sensitivity and precision have been reported (44). If a com-
mon calibrator was used, assay results were found to be
comparable, but currently there is no recognized agree-
ment on calibration for clinically available cystatin C as-
says (22,44).
Thus, creatinine and cystatin C laboratory methodolo-
gies vary and the coefficients of each GFR estimating equa-
tion are critically dependent on assay methodology (4).
This further complicates the interpretation and accuracy of
GFRs obtained from estimating equations, and clinicians
and researchers must be aware of such limitations when
applying GFR estimating equations. There is currently a
global creatinine standardization initiative that seeks to
reduce interlaboratory variation in creatinine by referenc-
ing all creatinine assays to isotope dilution mass spectros-
copy (IDMS) standards (14). This may allow for the devel-
opment of more universal GFR creatinine-based estimating
equations in which the accuracy does not depend on the
clinician knowing the creatinine assay of a given labora-
tory and applying the equation that was developed using
that assay. Standardization of cystatin C assay calibrators
would also have obvious clinical and research benefits (45).
As creatinine values in NHANES are traceable to enzy-
matic methods, and the novel bedside CKiD equation was

also derived using enzymatic creatinine laboratory meth-
ods, it would be expected that the range of eGFR using the
CKiD equation in the NHANES population would be close
to that expected for healthy adolescents. However, 50%
of the cohort had an eGFR 100 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and
there may be several possible reasons for this. First, creat-
inine assays, particularly Jaffe
´, are known to be less precise
at lower levels of creatinine typical of the healthy adoles-
cent cohort we studied, and this could potentially lead to
measurement error in creatinine, and thus GFR estimation
(15). Second, as described in the Materials and Methods
section, creatinine values obtained via a modified Jaffe
´
reaction by NHANES are compared with values in the
same patient measured by a gold standard IDMS assay. If
a difference exists, a correction is recommended by
NHANES so that the creatinine values reflect those trace-
able to the IDMS standard, as recommended by NKDEP. A
difference existed for the 1999­2000 NHANES cycle, and a
correction was recommended, but not for the 2001­2002
cycle. The correction was made via a regression equation
(see Materials and Methods section) and resulted in serum
creatinine values being increased for half the cohort, and
the percentage increase varied by the creatinine value. For
a serum creatinine of 0.6, the correction led to a 20%
increase in serum creatinine, and for a creatinine of 1.0, the
increase was 14%. The differential in percentage increase of
serum creatinine based on the correction would be ex-
pected to slightly bias toward a greater increase in creati-
nine among those with lower creatinines, and as the me-
dian creatinine in this cohort was 0.7 mg/dl, this must be
considered. However, the range of serum creatinine in this
cohort was narrow, and the differential percentage in-
crease based on the correction was also small. To deter-
mine if this correction was responsible for the low eGFRs
observed among the cohort, a subanalysis stratified the
participants in 1999­2000 (corrected creatinine) and 2001­
2002 (no correction). The distributions were similar to each
other, and to the combined cohort: the 5th, 50th, and 95th
percentiles for bedside CKiD eGFR for 1999­2000 were
71.1, 97.8, and 130.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2; for 2001­2002
they were 71.2, 96.0, and 132.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2; and for
1999­2002 they were 71.1, 96.6, and 131.6 ml/min per
1.73 m2, respectively.
Finally, adult GFR estimating equations such as the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) have been
shown to underestimate GFR among those with higher, or
normal, GFRs (16,17,46), and this possibility should be
considered with pediatric GFR estimating equations, al-
though this has not yet been examined in detail (47). Mul-
tiple reasons have been offered to explain why GFR esti-
mating equations developed from populations with CKD
may underestimate measured GFR in adults without CKD.
Creatinine measurement error, especially at lower levels of
creatinine, must be considered as described above. Varia-
tions in serum creatinine in those without CKD may be
more reflective of a difference in muscle mass, growth, or
protein intake, and possibly measurement error, rather
than the GFR. In contrast, creatinine variations among
those with CKD are more likely to be representative of
changes in GFR. Thus, the magnitude of the relationship
between creatinine and GFR may be greater among those
with CKD compared with those without CKD (3,16,46).
The novel Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collab-
oration (CKD-EPI) equation was developed in adults to be
as accurate as the MDRD equation at lower GFRs and more
accurate at higher GFRs (48). To accomplish this, the CKD-
EPI equation included more participants with higher
GFRs; the CKD-EPI development data set mean GFR (SD)

was 68 (40) ml/min per 1.73 m2, compared with 39.8 (21.2)
in the MDRD cohort (49). Additionally, a spline term is
included in the CKD-EPI equation that accounts for a
weaker relationship between creatinine and GFR at lower
creatinine levels than at higher levels. It is anticipated that
the CKD-EPI equation should lead to more accurate esti-
mates of eGFR and the burden of CKD in the adult U.S.
population (48). Studies including formal GFR measure-
ment in children with normal kidney function are needed
to confirm age- and sex-specific normative values, and
evaluate the accuracy of current pediatric GFR estimating
equations at higher or normal levels of GFR (50).
Accurate estimation of GFR in children has obvious
clinical and research benefits. This analysis underscores
that appropriate application of pediatric estimating equa-
tions requires an understanding of the creatinine and cys-
tatin C laboratory methods used in a given clinical or
research setting and the methods used to develop the
equations. Efforts by NKDEP to standardize laboratory
assay calibrators will help minimize the measurement vari-
ation that affects the accuracy of all GFR estimating equa-
tions. The novel CKiD GFR estimating equations have been
shown to have excellent precision and accuracy at GFRs
between 15 and 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (4). The precision
and accuracy in children with higher or normal GFRs
cannot be fully addressed in this analysis because of the
lack of formally measured GFR. However, the low range of
eGFR in this healthy population without evidence of CKD
observed in this study is of interest. From a CKD screening
standpoint, the Laboratory Working Group of NKDEP rec-
ommends reporting eGFR values above 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 as "60 ml/min per 1.73 m2" in adults (14). There
is no pediatric-specific recommendation, but the NKDEP
eGFR calculator currently reports "75 ml/min per 1.73
m2" for GFRs 75 using the beside CKiD equation (40). On
the basis of this study, approximately 9% of the adolescent
population may fall below 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 using
the bedside CKiD equation, and the broader clinical con-
text should be considered while evaluating this population
for CKD. The population-based eGFR percentiles for each
equation provided in Table 3 may help clinicians deter-
mine the normal range of eGFR, and thus better identify
children at risk for loss of kidney function. However, clin-
ical validation of eGFR in the general pediatric population
is needed before using these equations to screen for CKD
whenever a serum creatinine or cystatin C is obtained.
