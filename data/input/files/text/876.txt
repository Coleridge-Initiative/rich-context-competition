Dietary Calcium and Blood
Pressure in National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys I and II
CHRISTOPHER SEMPOS, RICHARD COOPER, MARY GRACE KOVAR, CLIFFORD JOHNSON,
TERRENCE DRTZD, AND ELIZABETH YETLEY
SUMMARY It has recently been reported that a low intake of calcium may be a risk factor for
hypertension. In view of the contradictory results, even when the same survey data base has been used
by different researchers, an in-depth analysis was undertaken of the data provided by the two cycles of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Both surveys, conducted in
consecutive 4-year intervals during the 1970s, were designed to examine representative samples of the
U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. The overall descriptive findings in relation to mean
blood pressure and calcium intake were virtually identical in the two surveys. Based on "quantile"
analysis, neither mean levels of blood pressure nor the prevalence of hypertension was related to
calcium intake. Only among black men in NHANES I was a relationship between calcium intake and
blood pressure noted. This finding was not apparent among black men in NHANES II or among any of
the other sex-race groups in either survey. We conclude that the data of NHANES I and H do not show
an association between low calcium intake and blood pressure. (Hypertension 8: 1067-1074, 1986)

INVESTIGATING the relationship between di-
etary factors and a chronic disease such as hyper-
tension is difficult. Short-term dietary patterns,
let alone lifetime habits, are hard to measure. Further-
more, hypertension develops over a period of many
years, and cross-sectional studies may miss causal re-
lationships altogether. On the other hand, it seems
likely that dietary factors play a role in the develop-
ment or prevention of hypertension in populations.
Because of the urgency of our need to identify these
dietary factors as a basis for primary prevention, we
must use all potentially informative data sources on
nutrient intakes and blood pressure. Nationally repre-
sentative population samples offer unique advantages
for these purposes, and the recurring U.S. surveys of

the National Center for Health Statistics have become a
crucial resource in this field.
Because of controversial reports of an association
between low dietary calcium intake and high blood
pressure based on data from the first National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) and
other studies,1"7 we examined the entire data base
provided by both the first and second NHANES. In
addition to including data from both surveys, we in-
corporated the sampling weights and the complex
survey design into the analysis. The weights are need-
ed to adjust for differential sampling and nonresponse;
they affect the estimated means and percentages. The
clustered complex design affects variances and test
statistics.8
Subjects and Methods
Both NHANES I and II were designed to be national
probability samples of the civilian, noninstitution-
alized U.S. population.*-" The first survey, NHANES
I, took place during the years 1971 to 1974 and includ-
ed 20,749 examined persons aged 1 to 74 years. The
second study, NHANES II, was conducted during the
years 1976 to 1980 and included 20,322 examined
persons aged 6 months to 74 years.12

Analytic Samples
The age range from the analytic samples from
NHANES I and II that were used in this article was
restricted to ages 40 to 74 years. Persons below 40
years were excluded from the analysis because hyper-
tension occurs infrequently in younger persons. Per-
sons 75 years and older were not included in the
survey. Other exclusionary criteria used in the infor-
mation of the analytic samples are listed in the Appen-
dix (see p. 1071); the same exclusions were applied
to both surveys. Additionally, one person in the
NHANES II sample who reported consuming 8 quarts
of milk and 9854 mg of calcium in one day was ex-
cluded from the final analytic sample.
Before any of the exclusions other than age were
made, there were 7496 persons in the NHANES I
study sample and 7380 persons in the NHANES II
study sample. After the other exclusionary criteria
were applied, thefinalanalytic samples for NHANES I
and II contained 5840 and 5490 persons, respectively.
The estimated civilian noninstitutionalized U.S.
population represented by the number of examined
persons when appropriately weighted closely approxi-
mates the U.S. population estimated by the U.S. Bu-
reau of the Census at the midpoint of each survey.12'13
Measurements
Dietary calcium intake was estimated in both sur-
veys by using a single 24-hour recall.9' " In the Nutri-
tion Examination Sample of NHANES I, blood pres-
sure was recorded once in the sitting position at the
beginning of the medical examination by the physi-
cian. In NHANES II, the examining physician record-
ed each subject's blood pressure three times: 1) seated
at the beginning of the examination, 2) recumbent at
the end of the examination, and 3) seated at the end of
the examination. So that the data from NHANES II
would be comparable with NHANES I data, only the
first seated blood pressure value from NHANES II was
used in the analysis for this study. Systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) was taken as the first phase of Korotkoff
sounds, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was taken
as thefifthphase. Therecommendationsof the Ameri-
can Heart Association were followed for blood pres-
sure measurement in both surveys. Body weight was
measured on a carefully calibrated self-balancing
scale. Height was measured using a device attached to
the scale and recorded photographically.14' "
Statistical Analyses
Two basic analytic strategies were used to investi-
gate the possible association between dietary calcium
intake and blood pressure. First, mean calcium intakes
of normotensive (DBP < 90 mm Hg) and hypertensive
subjects (DBP > 90 mm Hg) were compared. Second,
mean blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and prevalence of
hypertension were calculated for persons within five
dietary calcium intake groups. The five groups were
composed of persons with calcium intakes of 1) 250
mg or less, 2) 251 to 500 mg, 3) 501 to 750 mg, 4) 751
to 1000 mg, and 5) more than 1000 mg. Mean blood
pressure (SBP and DBP) and prevalence of hyperten-
sion in the first four calcium intake groups
(< 250-1000 mg) were compared with the values for
the group with an intake of greater than 1000 mg. No
comparison tests were made among the first four cal-
cium intake groups.
Because of prior research supporting a negative as-
sociation between dietary calcium and blood pressure,
a one-sided t test was used to test the two primary
hypotheses: 1) hypertensive subjects would have a sig-
nificantly lower mean intake of dietary calcium than
normotensive subjects and 2) subjects in the first four
calcium intake groups would have significantly higher
mean blood pressure and prevalence of hypertension
than the subjects in the highest calcium intake group.
For the multiple comparison tests of significance with-
in the calcium intake groups, the critical value of the t
distribution was based on the Bonferroni inequality.16
The t value to achieve significance at ap level of 0.05
based on a one-sided test and four comparisons was
2.24. All analyses were conducted separately for each
of the four race-sex groups, and within each race-sex
group data were adjusted for age (in years) and body
mass index (BMI). The BMI was defined as weight
(kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared. Re-
sults were not affected by adjusting for potassium in-
take, education, poverty index,12'13 or, in NHANES II,
serum zinc (data not shown).
All statistical analyses were conducted using the
Statistical Analysis System (SAS)17 and procedures de-
veloped at Research Triangle Institute and accessible
through SAS.18' " The complexities of the sample de-
signs in NHANES I and II were incorporated in all
analyses reported in this article. Thus, all reported
statistics are estimates for the U.S. civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population. The rationale and importance of
using sampling weights and design effects in the statis-
tical analysis of NHANES data have been discussed
elsewhere.8 Unweighted sample sizes are also reported
to provide an indication of the adequacy of the analytic
sample sizes in the four subgroups.
Results
Except for the statistically significant drop in mean
SBP and the increase in potassium intake from
NHANES I to NHANES n, the analytic samples from
the two surveys appear remarkably similar (Table 1).
The means from one analytic sample to the next were
generally very close to each other; the one exception
was the NHANES I and II comparison for black men
(Table 2). Black women had the lowest mean intakes
of dietary calcium in both surveys, while mean intakes
for black men were similar to the values for white
women, and white men had the highest mean intakes
(see Table 2).
Normotensive black men in NHANES I had a sig-
nificantly (p < 0.05) higher mean intake of dietary cal-
cium than did hypertensive black men after adjusting
for age and BMI. In no other race-sex group in either
analytic sample did normotensive subjects have sig-

nificantly (p<0.05) higher mean intakes of dietary
calcium after adjusting for age and BMI (see Table 2).
When hypertension was defined as a blood pressure
of 160/95 mm Hg or greater, only the black hyperten-
sive men from NHANES I were found to have a sig-
nificantly (p<0.05) lower adjusted mean dietary cal-
cium intake (514 ± 29 mg) than black normotensive
men (738 ± 54 mg). When hypertension was defined
as a SBP of 160 mm Hg or greater, hypertensive white
women in NHANES I (604 ± 10 vs 553 ± 22 mg) and
black hypertensive women in NHANES II (495 ± 29
vs 408 ± 59 mg) had significantly (p<0.05) lower
adjusted mean calcium intakes than did white and
black normotensive women, respectively. There were
no other significant differences in either NHANES I or
II. No significant differences were found when hyper-
tension was defined as a DBP of 95 mm Hg or greater
or as a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater
(data not shown).
Shown in Table 3 are the number of examined per-
sons in each of the calcium intake groups by race and
sex. For white men and women, there was a reason-
ably large number of examined persons in each group.
However, the very small sample sizes for black men
and women in the two highest calcium intake groups in
both surveys and in the middle quintile group in
NHANES U may lead to unreliable estimates of mean
blood pressure. That fact must be taken into account
when examining the results in Tables 4 and 5. The
sample sizes for black men and women in the highest
calcium intake groups were too small to estimate prev-
alence of hypertension; accordingly, only results for
whites will be given when estimating the prevalence of
hypertension (see Table 6).
Mean values for SBP and DBP after adjustment for
age and BMI are shown by race and sex for each of the
calcium intake groups in Tables 4 and 5. For black
men, only mean SBP and DBP in the lowest calcium
intake group (<250 mg) and mean SBP in the 501 to
750 mg intake group were significantly (p<0.05)
higher than the values for the highest calcium intake
group (> 1000 mg), and then only in NHANES I, not
in NHANES II. There were no other statistically sig-
nificant differences in either table, although black
women in NHANES I showed a nonsignificant trend
toward higher blood pressure with lower calcium in-

take. In NHANES I, however, there does appear to be
a threshold effect at a calcium intake of 1000 mg in
black men and women, but this may be due to the small
sample size in the highest intake group. The possible
threshold effect was not seen in whites from NHANES
I or in any race-sex group in NHANES LI. Notice also
that, except for dietary calcium intake greater than
1000 mg, blacks of both sexes within the same calcium
intake group tended to have higher mean SBP and DBP
than their white counterparts.
The prevalence of a DBP of 90 mm Hg or more did
not vary significantly (p>0.05) by calcium intake
group for white men or women in either NHANES I
and II (Table 6). Again, in neither NHANES I nor II
was a significant difference found for either sex us-
ing any of the other four definitions of hypertension:
1) DBP of 95 mm Hg or more, 2) blood pressure of
140/90 mm Hg or more, 3) blood pressure of 160/95
mm Hg or more, and 4) SBP of 160 mm Hg or more
(data not shown).
Discussion
The results of our analyses do not support the
hypothesis that dietary calcium intake is negatively
associated with blood pressure or the prevalence of
hypertension, nor do they support the hypothesis that
low calcium intakes by blacks can explain blood pres-
sure differences between blacks and whites. Hyperten-
sive subjects, defined as persons having a DBP of 90
mm Hg or more, did not report significantly lower
dietary calcium intakes. Except for black men in
NHANES I, mean blood pressure (SBP and DBP) in
the lowest dietary calcium intake groups (^ 250 mg)
was not significantly greater than the means for the
highest intake group (> 1000 mg), and the prevalence
of hypertension in whites was not found to berelatedto
intake of dietary calcium.
Our results do not rule out the possibility that such
an association does exist, however. Two principal
points need to be considered in this regard: 1) the
design of NHANES I and II and 2) the effects of high

ratios of within-person (a2,) to between-person £
variation in the intake of dietary calcium and in SBP
and DBP.
Both NHANES I and NHANES II were cross-sec-
tional surveys. As a result, a person's reported dietary
calcium intake may not accurately represent the usual
intake over a long period before the survey or, for that
matter, the usual intake at present.20'2I An epidemio-
logical follow-up survey of adults examined in
NHANES I has recently been completed, and future
analysis of those data will be helpful in investigating
the relationship of prior dietary calcium intake to blood
pressure and the incidence of hypertension.22
Reported dietary intake was estimated in both sur-
veys from one 24-hour recall. The estimated intakes,
as such, do not include nutrient intake from nonfood
sources (e.g., vitamin or mineral supplements) or wa-
ter. Calcium supplement use does not appear to have
been common at the time of either survey. Of approxi-
mately 20,000 persons examined in each survey, only
26 people in NHANES I and 65 in NHANES U stated
that their primary supplement was a calcium supple-
ment. However, the more common usage of multivita-
min or mineral supplements would have supplied some
calcium that would not be accounted for in the intake
estimates for dietary calcium. Although water hard-
ness data are available from an augmentation survey to
NHANES I, there are no such data for the general
sample from NHANES I or NHANES II. Water ac-
counts for a significant proportion of total calcium
intake.23 However, a recent study that accounted for
calcium intake from all sources also failed to find a
significant relationship between estimated current cal-
cium intake and blood pressure.24
A phenomenon that also plays an important role in
the ability to estimate accurately an individual's usual
intake of calcium, or an individual's usual value for
any variable (e.g., blood pressure), is the ratio of the
amount of variation within (A]) to the amount of vari-
ation that exists between (a2) individuals. High ratios
of al/al will bias correlation and slope coefficients
toward zero.20'2I In general, ratios of o\Jol for dietary
intake are greater than 1, indicating that there is more
variation within the diets of individuals than there is
between them.20 In cross-sectional surveys such as
NHANES I and II, in which subject's intake is estimat-
ed from only one 24-hour recall or diet record, this
implies that correlation and slope coefficients based on
individual data will underestimate the magnitude of the
association under investigation.20-21'23~30 The ratio of
G2Ja\ for calcium has been estimated to be approxi-
mately equal to 1 .Mi n As a result, the observed regres-
sion slope for the model in which blood pressure is
regressed on each subject's dietary calcium intake may
underestimate the true slope by 50% or more.20
There are only two ways to reduce the impact of
high ratios of aj/cy2,: 1) increase the number of mea-
surements of diet or blood pressure to be collected
from each person, which in the case of a completed
survey like the NHANES is a moot point, and 2) base
the analysis on groups instead of individuals.
Although there is within-person variability associat-
ed with blood pressure, the ratios of al/cl for SBP
(0.22) and DBP (0.26) were small (ratios of a2ja2
w
for
SBP and DBP were estimated from NHANES II data
by applying the correlation between the first and sec-
ond seated SBP [r12
= 0.821] and DBP [rn
= 0.792] to
the formula a2jal = [1 - rn
]/rl2
from Liu et al.21) As a
result, our major concern was for the ratio of cs2jol for
dietary calcium. By breaking up dietary calcium intake
into quintiles, we were able to reduce misclassification
error. For example, given aw
equal to 255 for cal-
cium,29 and one 24-hour recall, the probability (p) of
misclassifying a subject from the fifth quintile (> 1000
mg) to the first, second, or third quintiles was 0.0013,
0.023, and 0.159, respectively. As a result, misclassi-
fication error should not have affected our compari-
sons of SBP and DBP between the first and fifth quin-
tiles and the second and fifth quintiles.
Even in using a "quantile" method of analysis, po-
tential problems remain. First of all, as shown, there
must be a sufficiently large distance between the two
groups being compared to gain any advantage at all.
Second, the accuracy of the estimate of the mean value
for the group and the power to detect differences be-
tween groups are also a function of the sample size.
The requirements of large numbers of groups and a
large sample size within each group tend to oppose
each other. For a fixed sample size, therefore, only a
limited number of groups is possible.
Sample size and power are also important issues
when comparing means between normotensive and hy-
pertensive subjects. For black men and women, the
power to detect a 100-mg difference in mean dietary
calcium intake varied from approximately 0.9 in
NHANES I to 0.7 in NHANES II. (The power esti-
mates were calculated assuming the following for
blacks: at least 200 people per group in NHANES I and
125 people per group in NHANES II; and for white: at
least 700 people per group in either survey; value of
aw
= 255 for calcium; one 24-hour recall, and
a = 0.05 (one-sided) equal to 1.645.16'2]- *>) The lower
power in NHANES II reflects the smaller analytic sam-
ples for black men and women in that survey (see
Table 2). The small sample also may have contributed
to the inability to find an association between calcium
and blood pressure for black men and women in
NHANES n. For white men and women, the sample
sizes shown in Table 2 were large enough to detect a
50-mg difference in mean dietary calcium intake with a
power of approximately 0.8.
Another factor that could have affected our ability to
find an association between dietary calcium and blood
pressure was the exclusion of all persons receiving
antihypertensive medication. People receiving antihy-
pertensive medications may represent a pool of
calcium-sensitive individuals. It was necessary, how-
ever, to exclude these persons from analysis, since
their blood pressure values while receiving medication
would not represent their "real" value. From NHANES
I to NHANES II there was approximately a 10% in-
crease in the number of people receiving antihyperten-
sive medication. Their exclusion from both analytic
samples coupled with their increase in NHANES II
DIETARY CALCIUM AND BLOOD PRESSUREASemptw et al. 1073
may have biased the results from NHANES I, and
especially those from NHANES II, toward finding no
association.
The use of "quantile" methods of analysis for these
cross-sectional data provided results that seem to con-
tradict results found by other investigators using
NHANES I and II data, who reported finding a statisti-
cally significant association between dietary calcium
intake and blood pressure.1- 7>31 Careful comparison of
the reported findings, however, resolves this apparent
contradiction. The article by McCarron et al.7 has been
reviewed elsewhere32 and need not be discussed here.
Recently, Harlan et al.131 have published two addi-
tional articles on blood pressure-nutrient associations,
based on subsamples from NHANES I and II. In both
reports stepwise regression procedures were used to
determine the best predictors of blood pressure from a
group of approximately 30 variables, which included
dietary calcium intake. The NHANES I data were re-
ported by sex and by race but, because of the small
sample size, were not cross-classified into the four
sex-race groups used for this analysis. Similarly,
NHANES II data were reported by sex alone.
Based on data from the NHANES I sample of per-
sons aged 25 to 74 years who received a detailed medi-
cal examination, it was reported that low dietary cal-
cium was a predictor of SBP in men, DBP in women,
and DBP in blacks.1 However, the coefficient for SBP
for men was positive, and for women was nonsignifi-
cant (/ = -- 1.89). Thus, only for DBP among blacks
was the association between calcium and DBP both
significant and negative. Based on data from a differ-
ent subsample from NHANES II, dietary calcium was
not associated with blood pressure in men or women,
although the authors did report a significant associ-
ation between the scaled frequency of consumption of
calcium-rich foods and blood pressure in women
alone.31 Finally, a recent reanalysis of NHANES I data
demonstrated an association only among black men.33
What emerges from these various methods of analysis,
in our view, is that there was a negative association
between dietary calcium and blood pressure only in
black men and only in NHANES I. Given the multiple
subgroups examined, and the lack of confirmation of
this finding in NHANES II, it would seem reasonable
to regard this as a chance finding that has yet to be
confirmed by replication.
Four additional epidemiological surveys have exam-
ined the relationship between dietary calcium and
blood pressure. A low intake of milk products or cal-
cium was associated with higher blood pressure in
studies from Honolulu, Puerto Rico, and San Diego.2"4
Persons with cardiovascular disease who participated
in those cardiovascular disease surveys may have re-
duced their fat intake, however, thus confounding the
milk-blood pressure association. Nichaman et al.3 re-
ported an association between calcium intake and DBP
in multiple linear regression analysis performed on the
baseline data in the Western Electric Study. An addi-
tional case-control study suggested that hypertensive
subjects consumed less calcium.6 Only 45 participants
were included in each group in this last study, how-
ever, and while patients were drawn from a clinic
population, controls were apparently university per-
sonnel. All of the dietary differences in calcium could
be explained by increased yogurt and cheese consump-
tion in the controls. Dietary supplementation with cal-
cium has also been reported to reduce blood pressure in
normotensive volunteers in one study34 and in per-
sons receiving antihypertensive medication in another
study.35
In contrast to the contradictory findings for dietary
calcium and blood pressure, a highly consistent rela-
tionship between total serum calcium and blood pres-
sure appears to be established. Several large studies,
most including more than 10,000 participants, have
demonstrated a significant increase in blood pressure
with rising levels of total serum calcium. '·36~39 McCar-
ron,40 on the other hand, has reported lower ionized
calcium in a series of 23 patients, while two additional
studies found no difference between patients and con-
trols in ionized calcium.4142 A high correlation be-
tween ionized and total serum calcium exists in per-
sons with normal serum albumin; thus, opposite
associations with hypertension seem unlikely. The
weight of the evidence therefore supports a positive
association between serum calcium and blood pres-
sure. Whether dietary factors play a significant role in
this association, or whether higher serum calcium is a
result of hypertension itself, remains to be determined.
Investigations into the physiological controls of ion-
ized calcium, as well as magnesium and vasoactive
hormones, may further elucidate these matters.43 There
is, however, some suggestion that hypertensive sub-
jects with low serum levels of ionized calcium and low
plasma renin levels may respond to calcium supple-
mentation.44 Our results do not rule out the possibility
that there may be a subgroup of hypertensive subjects
for which a negative relationship exists between blood
pressure and calcium intake.
A new and interesting field of investigation has been
developing in relation to cellular calcium and hyper-
tension. High free cytosolic calcium in platelets4346
has been reported in hypertensive subjects, along with
a variety of abnormalities in flux rates and binding of
calcium.47'w These findings are yet too fragmentary to
allow definitive conclusions, however. It seems likely,
nonetheless, that the relationships among dietary, se-
rum, and cellular calcium are complicated and indi-
rect, with a number of independent control mecha-
nisms involved in the regulation of serum and
intracellular levels. Although the available evidence
supports the view that calcium is higher in the serum
and cells in hypertensive subjects, the importance of
dietary calcium, in our opinion, remains controversial.
