Objective: To evaluate feeding difficulties and maternal behaviour during a feeding session with 1
month old infants prenatally exposed to cocaine and/or opiates.
Methods: The study is part of the maternal lifestyle study, which recruited 11 811 subjects at four
urban hospitals, then followed 1388 from 1 to 36 months of age. Exposure to cocaine and opiates was
determined by maternal interview and meconium assay. At the 1 month clinic visit, biological mothers
were videotaped while bottle feeding their infants. This sample included 364 exposed to cocaine, 45
exposed to opiates, 31 exposed to both drugs, and 588 matched comparison infants. Mothers were
mostly black, high school educated, and on public assistance. Videotapes were coded without knowl-
edge of exposure status for frequency, duration and quality of infant sucking, arousal, feeding prob-
lems, and maternal feeding activity and interaction.
Results: No cocaine effects were found on infant feeding measures, but cocaine-using mothers were
less flexible (6.29 v 6.50), less engaged (5.77 v 6.22), and had shorter feeding sessions (638 v 683
seconds). Opiate exposed infants showed prolonged sucking bursts (29 v 20 seconds), fewer pauses
(1.6 v 2.2 per minute), more feeding problems (0.55 v 0.38), and increased arousal (2.59 v 2.39).
Their mothers showed increased activity (30 v 22), independent of their infants' feeding problems.
Conclusions: Previous concerns about feeding behaviour in cocaine exposed infants may reflect the
quality of the feeding interaction rather than infant feeding problems related to prenatal exposure.
However, opiate exposed infants and their mothers both contributed to increased arousal and height-
ened feeding behaviour.
Feeding is not only essential for growth, but is a primary
context for interactions between infants and their moth-
ers in early infancy.1 2 Early identification of dyads at risk
for poor feeding offers an opportunity to intervene in the
future health and wellbeing of the infant.1 3 4 Evaluation of
neonatal feeding has been approached in three ways: clinical
reports of dysfunctional sucking, objective (computer as-
sisted) measurement of sucking patterns, and assessments of
mother-infant interaction during feeding. Several studies
have reported sucking or feeding problems when infants were
prenatally exposed to cocaine or opiates,1 5­12 although these
observations are controversial.13­15 Inconsistent findings may
reflect a failure to account for polydrug exposure and
sociodemographic factors,5 7­11 small sample sizes with inad-
equate power to detect subtle effects or low
generalisability,1 5 6 9 10 12 15 and convenience samples that are
not representative of the larger population of drug involved
dyads.5 9 Further, no study used methods that could evaluate
sucking, symptoms, and mother-infant interaction in the
same sample.5 6­15
The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that
infants exposed to cocaine and/or opiates have abnormal
sucking patterns and increased feeding problems and that
their mothers are less responsive than non-exposed dyads.
One month old infants and their mothers were observed dur-
ing a feeding session. Three aspects of feeding behaviour were
measured: sucking pattern; infant behaviour including
problems--for example, spitting up--and crying; and mater-
nal behaviour including feeding related activity--for example,
inserting or removing nipple--and interactive behaviours--
for example, vocalisation or touches.16 The duration of the
feeding was also measured, because the end of the session was
determined by the mother. The hypotheses were tested with
and without adjustment for prenatal exposure to alcohol,
tobacco, and marijuana, birth weight, socioeconomic class,
and site.
METHODS
Study design
The study was part of the Maternal lifestyle study.17 The latter
was conducted in four major university sites, which are part of
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment Neonatal Research Network (University of Miami, the
University of Tennessee at Memphis, Wayne State University
and Brown University). The study was conducted in two
phases: I, extended through hospital discharge; II, a longitudi-
nal study from 1 month to 36 months (postmenstrual age).
The study was approved by the institutional review board at
each site.
In phase I, more than 19 000 mothers were screened post
partum for enrollment between May 1993 and May 1995 at
the four sites (see Bauer et al17 for details). About 11 800 of the
eligible mother-infant dyads agreed to participate. Maternal
exclusion criteria included: age < 18 years; identified psycho-
sis or history of institutionalisation for retardation or
emotional problems; language barriers that prevented her
from giving informed consent or understanding the study.
Infant exclusion criteria included: outborn birth; multiple
gestation; birth weight < 501 g; gestational age > 42 weeks;
the infant was unlikely to survive in the judgment of the
attending doctor. A National Institute on Drug Abuse Certifi-
cate of Confidentiality was obtained by each site, which
ensured confidentiality of information on the subjects' drug
use. The certificate superseded the mandatory reporting of
illegal substance use that was in effect in the Florida and
Rhode Island sites. The certificate was explained to the mother

during the recruitment, and also informed consent procedure
including the condition that the certificate did not exclude
reporting of evidence of child abuse or neglect. Drug exposure
was determined by self report during a brief interview at
recruitment and meconium toxicology with presumptive
positive screens confirmed with gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry. The assay consisted of an enzyme multiplied
immunoassay technique screen for cocaine, opiates, tetra-
hydrocannabinol, amphetamines, and phencyclidine followed
by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic confirmation of
presumptive positive screens (see ElSohly et al18 and Lester et
al19 for details). Initial screening for phencyclidine and
amphetamine was stopped because of low prevalence.
Phase II was a longitudinal follow up of 1388 exposed and
comparison children between 1 month and 3 years of age. It
included subjects from phase I with evidence of exposure and
matched comparisons who signed a separate consent to
participate in the follow up phase of the Maternal lifestyle
study. The study definition of "exposure" was the same in
phase I and II: maternal admission of cocaine or opiate use
during this pregnancy based on the hospital interview or
positive gas chromatography-mass spectrometric confirma-
tion of cocaine or opiate metabolites. Opiates were included in
the exposed group because of hospital reports indicating that
many cocaine users were also using opiates. In phase II, "non-
exposed" was defined as denial of cocaine or opiate use during
this pregnancy and a negative enzyme multiplied immu-
noassay technique screen for cocaine and opiate metabolites.
A history of maternal alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use
during the pregnancy was recorded during the hospital inter-
view and considered as background variables in both the
exposed and non-exposed groups. Use of tranquillisers and
barbiturates was less than 2% and occurred in both groups.
Exclusion criteria for phase II were infant chromosomal
abnormality or TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other, rubella, cytome-
galovirus, herpes virus) infection confirmed before the 1
month visit or if the mother planned to move out of the catch-
ment area. Non-exposed infants were group matched to
exposed infants within each centre on race, sex, and
gestational age. The 1388 mother/infant dyads (658 in the
exposed group and 730 in the comparison group) who came to
the 1 month visit were enrolled in the longitudinal study. The
uneven groups reflect the replacement of comparison subjects
by others if they withdrew consent before the 1 month visit,
which was not possible for the fixed population of exposed
subjects. The 1 month visit included the feeding procedure.
Subjects in the feeding study
Subjects were included in this study if they were bottle fed by
their biological mother and had a high quality videotape
recording (n = 1028). The result was 364 exposed to cocaine,
45 exposed to opiates, 31 exposed to both cocaine and opiates,
and 588 comparison infants not exposed to either cocaine or
opiates. From the original cohort of 1388, 360 subjects were
excluded: 46 were exclusively breast feeding; 70 infants or
mothers were unavailable; 118 sessions had technical prob-
lems resulting in unscorable videotapes; two infants were
more than 46 weeks of postmenstrual age at the time of the
feeding session; 100 infants were not cared for by their
biological mother; and 24 infants for whom information about
their exposure to drugs during pregnancy was unavailable, as
mothers failed to complete the interview or refused to answer
questions about level of substance use.
Procedure
Mothers brought their infants to the hospital clinic at 42­46
weeks postmenstrual age (1 month visit) for a neurobehav-
ioural testing battery20 including videotaped bottle feeding.
Mothers were instructed to withhold feeding if possible so
that the infant would be ready to feed on arrival at the clinic.
However, if the infant was sleeping or recently fed, the feeding
procedure was postponed to later in the clinic visit. The feed-
ing session was videotaped through one way mirrors to mini-
mise the intrusiveness of the camera and staff. Mothers were
instructed to feed their infants as they would at home and
indicate when they were finished. Breast feeding mothers
were not asked to participate. The procedure and subsequent
scoring were developed and validated with preterm and
growth retarded infants,16 21 and were sufficiently sensitive to
detect subtle changes in infant and maternal behaviour after
intervention.22
Mothers also completed three interviews: the Maternal
inventory of substance use (MISU),23 which is a detailed
interview on the timing and amount of cocaine, opiates, alco-
hol, nicotine, and marijuana use during pregnancy; socioeco-
nomic status, which is an assessment of the Hollingshead
index of social prestige modified for high risk families,24 and
the Addiction severity index.25 The only question from the
Addiction severity index used in this study was whether
mothers had experienced depression in the preceding 30 days.
Infants were weighed and measured by medical staff.
Behavioural scoring
Table 1 describes the behaviours that were scored from the
videotaped feeding session, and the resulting 13 summary
scores were used as dependent variables. In accordance with
published methods,16 22 research assistants masked to expo-
sure status coded the first 15 minutes of each feeding session
for maternal feeding behaviour ("activity" in table 1), mater-
nal interactive behaviour ("stimulation" in table 1), infant
sucking (sucking pattern in table 1), feeding problems
("problems" in table 1), and infant crying ("crying" in table
1). All behaviours were frequency counts except for infant
sucking, in which case the duration of sucking bursts was
coded. A sucking burst was defined as continuous sucking
without a pause of more than two seconds.26 After observing
the entire feeding session regardless of duration, coders com-
pleted rating scales that evaluated the level of maternal inter-
action ("engagement" in table 1), maternal flexibility to her
infants' feeding cues ("flexibility" in table 1), infant feeding
competence ("competence" in table 1), infant's predominant
state or arousal level27 ("arousal" in table 1), and the duration
of the feeding session ("session" in table 1).
Six coders were trained to reliability on an initial set of 10
videotapes prepared by two "gold standard" coders, coding 10
additional tapes as an initial reliability check. Individual tapes
were randomly selected twice a month for continuing reliabil-
ity checks across coders. Discrepancies between coders were
resolved by conferencing and consensus. The  statistic on the
duration of infant sucking was 0.84, and percentage
agreement on the onset and offset of sucking bursts was 68%
and 69%, respectively. Intraclass correlations calculated on the
summary scores described below ranged from 0.67 (infant
competence) to 0.97 (caretaker activities).
The 13 summary scores in table 1 were based on published
methods16 with the following exceptions: we measured the
duration of sucking bursts, the interburst interval, and
duration of the session for greater specificity of the sucking
pattern, and we generated two summary scores from the
seven maternal scales to distinguish feeding related (flexibil-
ity) from interactive (engagement) behaviour. No subjects
with short or long feeding sessions were excluded, but
frequency data were adjusted for length of the feeding session
if less than 15 minutes. Data loss occurred for infant summary
scores relevant to sucking pattern and arousal if the infant's
mouth or face was obscured (< 5%). Data loss for engagement
occurred when the mother never spoke to the child, as this
summary score evaluates the quality rather than the quantity
of interaction (2%). Data loss for interburst interval occurred
when there was only a single sucking burst during the feeding

session (< 4%). There was no association between prenatal
exposure to cocaine or opiates and data loss in these summary
scores.
Statistical analysis
t Tests and 2 statistics were used to compare the cocaine
and/or opiate exposed and comparison groups on medical and
other characteristics. The 13 dependent measures in table 1
were tested with four sets of analyses. Analysis 1 was a two
way analysis of variance testing two factors: any cocaine
exposure (exposed/non-exposed) and any opiate exposure
(exposed/non-exposed). The analysis of variance (type III sum
of squares) tests each factor after adjustment for the other.
The cocaine by opiate interaction was included in the model
only if it was significant. This approach yielded tests of expo-
sure effects in the primary analysis, avoiding post hoc analysis
on the primary study questions. Analysis 2 was a two way
analysis of variance testing cocaine and opiate effects after
adjustment for covariates described below. Analysis 3 was a
univariate analysis of heavy cocaine exposure, some cocaine
exposure, and no exposure. Heavy cocaine exposure was
defined as at least three days a week during the first
trimester.28 Any other cocaine exposure was considered some
exposure. These analyses were conducted on a subset of sub-
jects (873 of 1028) who admitted cocaine use on the MISU
and who did not use opiates during pregnancy based on initial
hospital interview, toxicology, or self report on the MISU. Opi-
ate users were excluded because opiate use could co-occur
with heavy, some, or no cocaine use and potentially confound
level of cocaine exposure effects. Analysis 4 was a one way
analysis of variance testing the three levels of cocaine
exposure groups after adjustment for covariates described
below. Student's Newman-Keuls tests were used for post hoc
analysis of significant effects for level of cocaine exposure.
Covariates
In analyses 2 and 4, covariates were included either because of
relevance to drug-using populations--for example, socioeco-
nomic status, birth weight, polydrug use--or because they
met the following statistical criteria: the variable correlated
with both drug exposure and feeding behaviour (p < 0.05),
and did not correlate highly with other covariates (Pearson
r < 0.70).29­32 The variables in tables 2 and 3 were examined for
possible inclusion as covariates because feeding behaviour has
been associated with maternal age,2 33 depression,34 35 low
income,2 socioeconomic status,33 maternal education,2 33 parity
(primiparous versus multiparous),2 33 race,1 2 infant's age,36 and
birth weight.2 33 The maternal and infant characteristics that
met the criteria and were used in the adjusted analyses
included: socioeconomic status,24 birth weight, conceptional
age (gestational + chronological age), maternal age, race, site,
and other drug use.
Covariates for other drug use
The pattern of drug use reported by the mother on the MISU
was used to generate covariates for alcohol, marijuana, and
tobacco by averaging use per day over the three trimesters of
pregnancy. The average for each drug use variable was reduced
to three categories of exposure (heavy, some, and none). Cut
offs for heavy exposure were based on published thresholds
for medical as well as neurobehavioural outcome.28 37 For alco-
hol, heavy exposure was > 0.5 oz of absolute alcohol a day
(one standard drink). For marijuana, heavy exposure was
defined as > 0.5 joints a day. For tobacco, heavy exposure was
defined as > 10 cigarettes a day. Each three category drug
variable was used to construct two covariates that tested
threshold effects: (a) the contrast between heavy and some/no
exposure; (b) the contrast between some and no exposure. For
example, if the contrast between some and no exposure was
significant but not the contrast between heavy and some/no
exposure, the interpretation would be that the threshold for
the effect is at the cut off for some exposure and there is no
additional effect for heavy exposure. This approach eliminated
the need for post hoc analysis. A separate covariate was
included for any occurrence of binge drinking (more than five
drinks at one time during pregnancy). Thus, other drug use
was measured by seven covariates (two for each drug and the
binge measure).

infants were about 4 days younger at the time of assessment
by both chronological and conceptional age (p = 0.008 and
p = 0.001 respectively). There were no significant differences
between the groups for gestational age (range 22­42 weeks),
weight (range 520­4440 g), length, and head circumference at
birth, Apgar scores, and sex. All infants were feeding in room
air during the feeding session.
Table 3 gives maternal characteristics. Most study partici-
pants were black, unmarried, Medicaid recipients with two
thirds of the sample falling below the federal poverty line, and
high school educated. Mothers who used cocaine were more
likely to be low socioeconomic status (p = 0.001), older
(p = 0.001), unmarried (p = 0.001), a Medicaid recipient
(p = 0.001), below the poverty line (p = 0.001), less educated
(p < 0.001), without prenatal care (p < 0.001), depressed
(p = 0.038), and multiparous (p = 0.001) than mothers in the
comparison group. Opiate-using mothers were more likely to
be older (p = 0.001), white (p = 0.001), and above the poverty
line (p = 0.001) than the comparison group.
Cocaine exposure
Table 4 shows the means for the study groups and results of
analysis 1 (unadjusted) and analysis 2 (adjusted for covari-
ates). The adjusted marginal means from analysis 2 are
presented for the main effects of cocaine exposure and opiate
exposure. There were no significant differences between
cocaine exposed and non-exposed infants in measures of
sucking pattern (sucking burst, interburst interval, proportion
of sucking, and bursts per minute), feeding competence, feed-
ing problems, crying, and level of arousal. However, mothers of
cocaine exposed infants showed less engagement (unad-
justed, p = 0 .003; adjusted, p = 0 .004), and less flexibility
(unadjusted, p = 0.022; adjusted, p = 0.024), and had a
shorter feeding session (unadjusted, p = 0 .001; adjusted,
p = 0.010) than mothers of non-exposed infants.
Opiate exposure
Opiate exposed infants showed longer sucking bursts (unad-
justed, p = 0 .044; adjusted, p = 0 .004), fewer bursts per
minute (unadjusted, p = 0.001; adjusted p = 0.001), more
feeding problems (unadjusted, p = 0.031; adjusted
p = 0.028), and higher arousal (unadjusted, p = 0.002;
adjusted, p = 0.021) than non-exposed infants. Mothers of
opiate exposed infants showed more feeding activity (unad-
justed, p = 0 .001; adjusted, p = 0.001) than mothers of non-
exposed infants. Increased stimulation (unadjusted,
p = 0.003) and less maternal flexibility (unadjusted,
p = 0.017) were found in the analysis without covariates, but
these effects were not significant when adjusted for covariates
(p > 0.05 in both cases).
The findings of longer and fewer sucking bursts, increased
problems and arousal in opiate exposed infants, and more
activity by their mothers raise the possibility that maternal
behaviour may account for infant behaviour rather than
opiate exposure per se. To test this hypothesis, infant
measures that showed significant opiate effects were reana-
lysed with adjustment for maternal activity in the context of
the other covariates. The main effects for opiate exposure on
the duration of sucking bursts (p = 0.018) and bursts per
minute (p = 0.042) were maintained, but the opiate effects on

arousal (p = 0.132) and feeding problems (p = 0.051) failed
to reach significance. These findings suggest that the
behaviour of opiate exposed infants was at least in part inde-
pendent of maternal behaviour.
Interaction of cocaine and opiate exposure
There were significant interaction effects of cocaine and opiate
exposure on arousal (unadjusted, p = 0.017; adjusted,
p = 0.018), stimulation (unadjusted, p = 0.035; adjusted,
p = 0.029), engagement (unadjusted, p = 0.014; adjusted,
p = 0.039), and flexibility (unadjusted, p = 0.037, only).
Tables 5 (unadjusted) and 6 (adjusted) show the main effect
differences for cocaine exposure and opiate exposure by expo-
sure to the other drug for these measures.
Cocaine exposed infants also exposed to opiates showed
higher arousal than non-exposed infants (unadjusted,
p = 0.047; adjusted p = 0.032). Similarly, opiate exposed
infants also exposed to cocaine showed higher arousal than
non-exposed infants. No differences in arousal were shown for
single drug exposure.
Mothers of cocaine exposed infants who used opiates
showed less stimulation than mothers of non-exposed
infants, but only in the adjusted analysis (unadjusted,
p = 0.092; adjusted, p = 0.045). Cocaine-using mothers who
did not use opiates showed no differences in stimulation.
Mothers of opiate exposed infants who did not use cocaine
showed more stimulation than mothers of non-exposed
infants (unadjusted, p = 0.001; adjusted, p = 0.01). But
opiate-using mothers who used cocaine showed no differences
in stimulation.
Cocaine-using mothers who used opiates showed less
engagement than mothers who did not use these drugs
(unadjusted, p = 0.005; adjusted, p = 0.008), whereas
mothers only using cocaine showed no differences
(unadjusted, p = 0.343; adjusted, p = 0.131). There were no
effects of opiate use on engagement with or without cocaine

Cocaine-using mothers who used opiates showed less
flexibility than mothers who did not use either drug
(unadjusted, p = 0.008). Similarly, opiate-using mothers who
also used cocaine showed less flexibility. No differences in
flexibility were shown for single drug use. The interaction
was not significant in the adjusted analysis of flexibility
(p = 0.069).

Heavy cocaine exposure
Table 7 gives the results for the three exposure groups (heavy,
some, and none) for analysis 3 (unadjusted) and analysis 4
(adjusted for covariates). The adjusted group means from
analysis 4 are presented. In the unadjusted analysis 3, heavy
cocaine exposure was associated with lower infant arousal
(p = 0.040) and shorter feeding sessions (p = 0.026) than
some or no exposure. When covariates were included (analy-
sis 4), these effects were no longer significant.
Weight gain
Given cocaine and opiate exposure effects on maternal and
infant feeding behaviour, weight gain per week (g) from birth
to the 1 month feeding session was calculated and tested
using analysis 2, which adjusted for covariates. This analysis
was conducted separately for preterm (< 38 weeks gestational
age) and term infants, as preterm infants have different
growth trajectories from term infants in part because of
greater chronological age at the feeding session. For term
infants, there were no significant differences in weight gain
between cocaine exposed and non-exposed infants (230 v 222
g/week; p = 0.532). For preterm infants, however, cocaine
exposed infants gained 25 g/week less than unexposed infants
(202 v 227 g/week; p = 0.047). There were no significant
differences in weight gain between opiate exposed and unex-
posed infants in term (226 v 225 g/week; p = 0.941) or
preterm infants (220 v 210 g/week; p = 0.409). Taken together
with the cocaine effects described above, these findings may
suggest that cocaine-using mothers with preterm infants are
the least flexible and engaging and have the shortest feeding
sessions. No support for this hypothesis was found. The results
of analysis of variance on these measures comparing term and
preterm cocaine exposed infants showed no significant differ-
ences (p > 0.249 in all cases).
Covariate effects
We also examined whether covariates themselves were useful
predictors of feeding behaviour. In both analyses 2 (cocaine
and opiate effects) and 4 (level of cocaine exposure effects),
mothers who were heavy tobacco users showed less flexibility
(p = 0.023) and less engagement (p = 0.007) than sometime
and non-users. Binge drinking was associated with a shorter
feeding session (p = 0.023). Low birth weight was associated
with more maternal stimulation (p = 0.001), less infant feed-
ing competence (p = 0.050), more feeding problems
(p = 0.010), and lower proportion of sucking (p = 0.010).
Higher socioeconomic status was related to more maternal
stimulation (p = 0.001) and engagement (p = 0.001), and
more infant crying (p = 0.017). Conceptional age was related
to longer sucking bursts (p = 0.013), higher proportion of
sucking (p = 0.006), and higher arousal (p = 0.001). Mater-
nal age was related to lower proportion of sucking
(p = 0.016), more maternal stimulation (p = 0.001), and
engagement (p = 0.001). Black mothers showed less stimula-
tion (p = 0.002), and their infants had a higher proportion of
sucking (p = 0.026) and fewer sucking bursts (p = 0.010).
Note that all main effects and covariate effects were partialled
in these results.
Birth weight as a mediator
Analyses with covariates (analysis 2 and 4) were repeated
excluding birth weight from the list of covariates because it
has been argued that if cocaine affects birth weight, the inclu-
sion of birth weight as a covariate will mask the effects of
cocaine.28 After birth weight had been excluded as a covariate,
no additional (or fewer) cocaine effects were found relative to
those previously reported with birth weight in the model.
DISCUSSION
Infants are born with a set of reflexes and endogenous suck-
ing rhythms, including alternation of sucking bursts and
pauses that guide and maintain feeding.26 38 There are
developmental changes in sucking rhythm within the first 2
weeks, with increased sucking and decreased pausing over
time, suggesting greater feeding efficiency as infants
mature.26 36 The typical pattern for mothers over this period is
to reduce feeding related activity--for example, stimulation
with the bottle--as well as social stimulation--for example,
vocalisations--that might interrupt the sucking rhythm, sug-
gesting maternal sensitivity to increased infant maturity.22 26 36
Cocaine exposure
Previous clinical reports have described poor and disorganised
feeding in neonates exposed to cocaine.1 9 11 Research using
objective measurement of nutritive and non-nutritive sucking
has reported decreased sucking (non-nutritive) among
cocaine exposed neonates (n = 16) compared with non-
exposed neonates,10 but these results were not replicated in a
second study with a larger sample of neonates (n = 71).14 In
our study, cocaine exposure was not associated with poor
sucking or feeding, and cocaine exposed infants did not show
disorganised, non-optimal sucking rhythms (sucking bursts,
interburst interval, bursts per minute) or increased feeding
problems. However, we cannot rule out atypical sucking
patterns, such as reduced sucking pressure, that could only be

detected by objective measurement systems and computer
analysis or could have occurred during the early neonatal
period and resolved by the 1 month feeding session.
Poor feeding could also result from the type and timing of
stimulation provided by mothers who might be less responsive
to their infants' cues or feeding difficulties.1 36 39­41 Previous
studies found that cocaine exposed infants gave fewer cues
and were less responsive to their mothers, and their mothers
were less sensitive to their infants' cues as newborns,5 and as
a consequence there were more dyadic conflicts as early as 2
months and up to 24 months of age.6 12 However, findings are
not replicated in a sample of infants 7­16 weeks of age,15 and
in this large, rigorously studied sample, cocaine exposed
infants were not less competent or less responsive feeders
than non-exposed infants. Nevertheless, their mothers were
less flexible in response to their infants' cues, were less warm
or engaged with their infants, and ended the feeding session
sooner. Further, cocaine-using mothers who also used opiates
were more likely to be disengaged from their infants as well as
less stimulating during feeding. These maternal findings sug-
gest less sensitivity and involvement with the infant during
the session. Because the infants did not compensate for the
shorter feed with a higher proportion of sucking or longer
sucking bursts, shorter feeding sessions resulted in less over-
all feeding opportunity.
Although we acknowledge that there are multiple determi-
nants of weight gain, we found that cocaine exposed preterm
infants gained less from birth to 44 weeks postmenstrual age
than comparison preterm infants after adjustment for birth
weight, conceptional age (gestational + chronological age), as
well as polydrug exposure, race, maternal age, and socioeco-
nomic status. As the feeding style of cocaine-using mothers
was similar for preterm and term infants, these findings sug-
gest that preterm, cocaine exposed infants may be more
vulnerable to maternal behaviour that limits feeding oppor-
tunity than term infants.
Opiate exposure
Previous research has documented less sucking, reduced
sucking pressure, and lower nutrient consumption in opiate
exposed neonates.7 8 In our study, opiate exposed infants did
not suck less during the feeding session. Rather, they showed
prolonged sucking with fewer pauses, more feeding problems
such as spitting up and refusal, and increased arousal. Opiate
exposed infants who were also exposed to cocaine were most
likely to be aroused. These behaviours are consistent with
clinical reports of opiate withdrawal.7 We cannot determine in
this study whether opiate exposed infants had poorer nutrient
consumption than non-exposed infants. However, both term
and preterm opiate exposed infants showed no decrements in
weight gain. Although there were increased arousal and feed-
ing problems, opiate exposed infants also had longer sucking
bursts and fewer breaks, which are consistent with greater
energy intake.
Opiate-using mothers showed more feeding activity, but
these behaviours did not account for their infants' heightened
sucking, although they may have contributed to the increased
arousal and feeding problems shown by the infants. Opiate-
using mothers also appeared to be less flexible and more
stimulating than non-using mothers, but these effects were
reduced after adjustment. However, opiate-using mothers who
did not use cocaine were more likely to stimulate their infants
than non-users after adjustment. By 1 month, increased
maternal activity not linked to infant feeding problems
suggests less sensitivity to infant cues39 by opiate-using moth-
ers.
There were no findings in common for cocaine and opiate
involved infants and mothers. The lack of common effects
suggests, as might be expected, that cocaine and opiates have
specific implications for the dyad. However, the combination
of cocaine and opiates appeared to exacerbate some of the
individual drug effects. Infants exposed to both drugs were
the most aroused. Mothers who used both drugs were the
least flexible and engaging with the infants.
Heavy cocaine exposure
On unadjusted analyses, heavy cocaine exposure was not
associated with any feeding behaviour except low arousal and
the length of the feeding session; however, neither effect was
significant after adjustment for covariates. These results
provide no evidence that cocaine exposure or even heavy
cocaine exposure compromises infant sucking and feeding
behaviour.
Substance exposure in context
It is important to note that maternal and infant feeding
behaviour is determined by many factors. Consistent with
previous research,2 33 low birth weight in this study was asso-
ciated with poorer feeding behaviour including lower pro-
portion of sucking, less feeding competence, and more feeding
problems at 1 month of adjusted age, suggesting less maturity
even after age correction. As expected,36 conceptional age,
which combines gestational age and chronological age,
predicted more mature feeding patterns. There was no associ-
ation between low birth weight and length of session or
maternal measures of feeding activity and flexibility. However,
mothers of preterm infants showed increased stimulation,
which may reflect greater maternal perception of infant
vulnerability.2 36 Birth weight is probably not a mediator vari-
able 42, meaning that cocaine effects could be masked by the
inclusion of birth weight. Firstly, significant cocaine and birth
weight effects did not overlap on any feeding measure.
Secondly, the results of analyses with and without birth
weight in the model generated the same cocaine findings.
Taken together, these observations suggest that birth weight
and cocaine effects were independent contributors to feeding
behaviour.
Higher socioeconomic status was also associated with more
maternal verbal and physical contact as well as emotional
engagement.1 33 Engagement evaluates the quality of attention
and affection, suggesting that the stimulation provided by
these higher socioeconomic status mothers was also warm
and responsive. Older mothers were also more stimulating and
engaging,1 33 but their babies spent less time sucking over the
session, suggesting that the increased interaction in this case
could have reduced feeding efficiency, unlike socioeconomic
status. Black mothers, who stimulated their infants less than
white or Hispanic mothers, had infants who spent more time
sucking over the session with fewer breaks, suggesting a pat-
tern of maximum feeding efficiency with little interaction.
Previous research on neonates exposed to alcohol/nicotine
found poor sucking, lower sucking pressure, and less
sucking.43­45 In our study, exposure to tobacco, alcohol, or
marijuana was not associated with any compromise of infant
sucking or feeding behaviour. However, heavy tobacco use was
related to decreased maternal flexibility and engagement, and
binge drinking was associated with a decreased length of ses-
sion, independent of cocaine effects. There were no marijuana
effects in the study.
The interpretation of this study is limited by efforts to
maintain a natural feeding session without intrusion by
equipment or staff. Without specialised equipment, we could
not detect high amplitude sucking, sucking pressure, and
sucking speed, which have been found to be sensitive to drug
exposure and related to energy intake and future weight
gain.3 4 43 Our rationale was that the burst and pause pattern of
infant sucking that is observable to coders is particularly sali-
ent to mothers and may be more closely linked to her levels of
activity and stimulation.26 Further, we did not obtain the exact
amount of formula the infant drank during the feeding to

determine feeding efficiency, but note that previous studies
reported a significant association between energy intake and
infant behaviour of the type measured in this study.16
However, our conclusions on feeding efficiency would have
benefited from direct measurement of energy intake during
the feeding. We excluded breast feeding dyads because moth-
ers may be uncomfortable being videotaped while feeding,
some of our feeding measures would not be appropriate, and
the number of mothers who breast fed was small. Thus, we
cannot assume that our findings apply to drug-using mothers
who breast feed their infants. Further, although the sample
was recruited randomly at four separate hospitals, the charac-
teristics of the hospital and self selected participation in the
follow up may also limit generalisability to other ethnic and/or
income groups. Given that we hypothesised negative effects of
drug exposure on infant and maternal behaviour a priori and
expected that these effects would be subtle, we did not correct
for the possibility of a type I error on primary planned analy-
ses. However, multiple comparison corrections were used for
all post hoc tests. The systematic pattern of findings across
analyses suggests that the results are not due to chance. Given
the large sample size, those effects close to the significance cut
off of p < 0.05 are of small effect size, which is expected in
analysis of prenatal drug exposure. To correct for multiple
tests would invite type II error, in which true effects are
missed.46 Findings of subtle effects not only enhance scientific
understanding but can have enormous impact on public policy
and treatment.47
Conclusion
Prenatal exposure to cocaine and opiates had unique implica-
tions for feeding behaviour in 1 month old infants and their
mothers, after polydrug use, birth weight, conceptional age,
and social factors were controlled for. Contrary to previous
concerns,1 5 9­12 cocaine exposed infants did not show feeding
difficulties in this study, whereas opiate exposed infants
showed prolonged sucking and other problems consistent
with signs of opiate withdrawal. Cocaine-using mothers were
less engaged and less flexible in response to their infants'
cues,5 whereas opiate-using mothers showed higher levels of
feeding activity, independent of the feeding problems shown
by their infants. Finally, the impact of using both cocaine and
opiates and the additive effect of tobacco suggests that infants
whose mothers use multiple drugs are likely to be the most at
risk of insensitive, inflexible parenting during feeding. Mater-
nal behaviour that overstimulates, controls, and potentially
limits feeding opportunity may compromise energy intake
and future weight gain and lead to mother-infant conflict.12
Concerns about feeding behaviour in cocaine exposed infants
may reflect problems related to the feeding interaction rather
than to feeding problems in the infant. Early feeding interac-
tions may reflect problems in the developing mother-infant
relationship that could have long term implications for poor
weight gain and subsequent relationship difficulties, particu-
larly for preterm infants.
