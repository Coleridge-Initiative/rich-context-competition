Unfriendly Shores: How
Immigrant Children Fare
In The U.S. Health System
Even children with legal citizenship, in working poor immigrant
families, find it difficult to obtain basic access to care, and the
problem is only getting worse.
by Sylvia Guendelman, Helen Halpin Schauffler, and Michelle Pearl
ABSTRACT: The proliferation of poor immigrant children in the United States
raises concern about their high uninsurance rates and access to care. We
examined the joint effects of health insurance status and place of birth on use
of health services by children of the working poor. Of foreign-born children, 52
percent were uninsured and 66 percent had a regular care source, compared
with 20 percent and 92 percent, respectively, of native-born children. Foreign-
born uninsured children were less likely than their native-born peers were to
have a regular care source or to have sought care. Health insurance and
immigration policies must act in concert to increase health care access for
foreign-born children.
More than one million children came to the United
States from other countries between 1987 and 1990.1 Since
1990 the number of children in immigrant families has
expanded almost seven times faster than the number in U.S.-born
families has. However, few studies have focused on access to health
care for foreign-born children.2 A recent study shows that such chil-
dren are at much higher risk of being uninsured than are native-born
children of either immigrant or native parents.3 Furthermore, there
are wide racial variations in insurance coverage among the foreign-
born. While Southeast Asian children have low rates of uninsurance
because of their refugee status, Latino immigrant children, who con-
stitute 55 percent of all children in immigrant families, have high
rates of uninsurance. Health insurance is a major determinant of
access to health care for immigrants.4 It promotes financial access to
care, connects children to a regular source of care, and enables use of

services.5 The extent to which foreign-born uninsured children ex-
perience more access barriers than U.S.-born uninsured children has
not been examined.
In this paper we examine the joint effects of health insurance
status and place of birth on access to care and use of health services
by children of the working poor. We assess if crude differences in
access and use along these two dimensions persist after socio-
economic status, demographic characteristics, and health status are
controlled for. We use a random probability sample of children from
the 1997 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
Study Methods
n Sample and data source. The NHIS is a continuing survey of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, sponsored by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Different households
are sampled each year for this cross-sectional survey. It is adminis-
tered face-to face by trained Census Bureau staff, using computer-
assisted technology.6
In 1997 one child per family was randomly selected for a more
in-depth interview on access to and use of health care. Of the 15,350
families with eligible children under age eighteen, 14,290 had inter-
view data on a selected child. Adult family members provided infor-
mation about their children. Compared with children whose par-
ents responded to the survey, children of nonrespondents were
more likely to be African American and in good rather than excellent
health. They did not differ with respect to disability status, place of
birth, receipt of public assistance, or insurance coverage.
Sampled children's records were linked to their parents' records
to determine parental work status. Children who did not live with a
parent (n = 487) were excluded. Parents were considered working
poor if they were either currently working or had been employed for
at least six months in the past year, and if their combined family
income was at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level
($31,822 for a family of four using 1996 poverty thresholds). Welfare
recipients were assumed to have incomes below 200 percent of
poverty. We imputed poverty level for 1,640 children who had miss-
ing information on income and could not be otherwise classified as
working poor. Imputation used a hot-decking approach, randomly
assigning a poverty level category (in 25 percent increments) char-
acterizing individuals with similar geographic location, parental
education, race/ethnicity, and broad income levels, if available. The
final sample included 5,342 children in working poor families.
n Measures of access and use of care. Access to care was
measured by the presence of a particular person or place to which a

child usually goes for treatment when sick, for health advice, or for
routine or preventive medical care; we also ascertained if the usual
place of care was a doctor's office or a health maintenance organiza-
tion (HMO) rather than a clinic, hospital, or some other place.
Respondents also were asked if they delayed or missed getting
medical care because they could not afford it, and the interval since
they last spoke to or saw a health professional about their child's
health. These variables were stratified by children's perceived health
status (excellent versus less than excellent). Health care utilization
variables included the number of visits to a doctor or other health
care professional, the use of two or more emergency room (ER)
visits, and the mean number of hospital episodes, all in the past year
and stratified by perceived health status. Small sample size pre-
cluded stratification on disability status.
n Independent variables. Children were classified into foreign-
and U.S.-born status. We used several questions from the health
insurance supplemental questionnaire to classify children into in-
sured (any private or public coverage) and uninsured status (if not
covered by any insurance and used public or free clinics exclusively).
Other independent variables included sex, age, ethnicity, health
status (excellent, very good/good, and fair/poor), and disability
status, defined as a reduction in daily living activities. Household
characteristics consisted of family structure and size, poverty level,
receipt of public assistance, highest parental education attainment,
and parental employment. Geographical characteristics included re-
gion and a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) location.
n Data analysis. We first compare foreign- and U.S.-born chil-
dren on sociodemographic characteristics and insurance status. We
then present unadjusted percentages and means for access and utili-
zation measures by place of birth and by the four combinations of
birth/insurance status. We adjust for covariates by using logistic
and linear regression. The covariates include the child's age, sex,
ethnicity, family structure, family size, disability status, parental
education, region, MSA, and perceived health status, where appro-
priate. These variables have been shown to affect access to health
care and utilization.7 In the main effects models for place of birth and
for insurance status, the other factor is also included as a covariate.
Adjusted rates are discussed in the text only.
Because the design of the NHIS is a complex, multistage sample,
the standard errors and significance tests are weighted and cor-
rected for stratification and sampling clustering. The analyses were
conducted using SAS version 6.12 and SUDAAN version 7.5.3.
There are several limitations to our approach. The NHIS is a
government survey that primarily interviews the legal population.

Undocumented persons who came to the United States illegally or
overstayed their visas are likely to be underrepresented. Results,
therefore, may underestimate the true problems of access and use for
immigrants. However, the foreign-born may travel abroad and re-
ceive care in the health care system of their country of origin, and
these encounters may not be reported in the NHIS. Because our
analysis is based on cross-sectional data, we cannot determine tem-
poral relationships between health insurance status and access to
and use of care. Furthermore, although our analysis of access and
utilization differentials includes statistical adjustment for available
covariates, some confounding inevitably remains. Finally, the recall
of health events and visits is known to be difficult, especially for
children who are frequent health care users.

n Characteristics of foreign-born children of the working poor.
Foreign-born children of working poor families in the United States
in 1997 were more likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to be
older and of Latino or Asian origin, and to live in two-parent house-
holds, in families with six or more members, and in households
where the head of the family has a low education (Exhibit 1). These

children also were more likely to live in households with incomes
below the federal poverty level yet not to depend on public assistance.
Although foreign-born children are perceived to have health
status that is similar to that of native-born children, the prevalence
of disabilities was lower among foreign-born children. In addition,
foreign-born children were two and one-half times more likely than
native-born children were to be uninsured in 1997.
n Access to care and use of services. Only 66 percent of the
foreign-born children of the working poor had a regular source of
care, compared with 92 percent of their U.S.-born counterparts, and
among these children, the foreign-born were less likely to seek care
in a doctor's office or HMO (Exhibit 2). The interval since foreign-
born children last visited a doctor was also longer than was the case
for native-born children. Among children in less-than-excellent
health, 15 percent of the foreign-born versus 2 percent of the U.S.-
born had never visited a physician or had not had a physician visit in
more than three years before the survey.

Similarly, among children in less-than-excellent health who vis-
ited a doctor in the previous year, foreign-born children had fewer
doctor visits. ER visits and hospital episodes were also lower among
foreign-born children than among U.S.-born children.
n Access and use differentials. Disparities in health care ac-
cess and use of service by health insurance status were found as
expected among both U.S.- and foreign-born children of the work-
ing poor (Exhibit 3). Yet among insured children, the foreign-born
were less likely than the U.S.-born were to have a regular care source
or to have visited a doctor in the previous year. Among those who
visited a doctor in the past year, foreign-born children in both excel-
lent and less-than-excellent health were less likely to have had four
or more doctor visits than were U.S.-born children of the same
health status. Furthermore, insured foreign-born children in less-
than-excellent health were less likely to have had two or more ER
visits than were their insured native-born counterparts. Differences
in birth status, particularly for regular source of care, were not ap-
parently attributable to differences in type of health insurance.
Among U.S.-born children, 61 percent had private coverage, com-
pared with 55 percent of foreign-born children.
Among the uninsured, foreign-born children were less likely than
U.S.-born children were to have a regular source of health care and
to seek care in a doctor's office or HMO. A delay of more than one
year since seeing a physician was also more likely for foreign-born
than for native-born uninsured children, regardless of health status.
Among uninsured children seeking care in the previous year,
foreign-born children in less-than-excellent health were less likely
to have four or more visits. The rates remained similar after adjust-
ing for confounders, with two exceptions: (1) the number of doctor
visits, which no longer showed birth-location disparities among the
uninsured in less-than-excellent health; and (2) the interval since
the last doctor visit, which was similar for foreign- and U.S.-born
uninsured children in excellent health. After adjusting for confoun-
ders, foreign-born uninsured children stood the highest risk of not
having a regular care source, for that care source not to have been
provided in a doctor's office or HMO, and for not having seen or
visited a doctor on a timely basis, if in less-than-excellent health.
We further examined differentials in access to care and utiliza-
tion within ethnic groups along birth status lines. Sample sizes
restricted this analysis to white and Latino children. Among white
uninsured children of the working poor, foreign-born children were
less likely than U.S.-born children were to delay or miss care be-
cause of lack of affordability but more likely not to have seen a
doctor in the past year, if they were in less-than-excellent health.

regular source of care and were less likely to have sought care in a
doctor's office or to have visited a doctor in the previous year. Latino
foreign-born children in less-than-excellent health also had fewer
than four doctor visits than did their Latino native-born counter-
parts, and those in excellent health tended to have fewer ER visits
than their native-born counterparts had (data not shown).
Birth status had similar associations with access to care among
the uninsured in the three age groups examined (younger than age
six, ages six to twelve, and ages thirteen to eighteen). In most cases,
foreign-born uninsured children were less likely to access care than
native-born uninsured children were. However, foreign-born chil-
dren over age six were more likely than their native-born counter-
parts were to delay care because care was unaffordable, and foreign-
born children ages thirteen to eighteen were the most likely to
experience intervals of three or more years without visiting a doctor.
Among the older children who had visited a doctor in the past year,
foreign-born children in less-than-excellent health were more likely
to have fewer doctor visits than were their native-born peers in
similar health (data not shown).
Discussion And Policy Implications
Our findings suggest a clear hierarchy in access to health care for the
children of America's working poor. On nearly every indicator we
examined, foreign-born children in working poor families had lower
access and health care use than did their U.S.-born counterparts,
uninsured children were worse off than insured children, and unin-
sured foreign-born children faced the worst access to health care.
What is even more troubling is that among foreign-born uninsured
children, those who had less-than-excellent health status faced
more barriers to timely access to care than did those whose health
status was excellent. Furthermore, consistent with other studies on
minority health, Latino foreign-born children--who constitute 58
percent of the foreign-born children of the working poor--faced
more barriers if uninsured than their white counterparts did, per-
haps because of cultural and legal barriers.8 These findings suggest
that health care, immigration, and welfare policies may be hamper-
ing access to health care for immigrants.9
In fact, the disparities in coverage for immigrant children may be
growing as a result of the Personal Responsibility and Work Oppor-
tunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, immigration poli-
cies, and ballot initiatives.10 PRWORA gave states the option of
terminating nonemergency Medicaid coverage for legal immigrants
who arrived after 22 August 1996. After a five-year stay, the income
of an immigrant's sponsor, along with the immigrant's personal in-

come, are to be counted when determining the immigrant's eligibil-
ity for public assistance and Medicaid. This is a marked change from
the prior social contract, which treated legal immigrants and U.S.
citizens alike in determining income and eligibility.11 Under
PRWORA, children of undocumented immigrants are no longer
able to receive Medicaid if designated as "permanently residing un-
der color of law." Furthermore, insurance expansions created under
the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) exclude
undocumented children.12 Many immigrant families have avoided
enrolling in Medicaid or SCHIP for fear of being labeled a "public
charge."
Our findings suggest that simply extending health insurance cov-
erage to uninsured foreign-born children of the working poor is
likely to have a major impact on their access to and use of health
care. Perhaps the most expedient policy solutions would be for
Congress to amend PRWORA by removing states' option to termi-
nate nonemergency Medicaid coverage and to prohibit states from
excluding foreign-born children from SCHIP. However, increasing
eligibility for public insurance programs may not be enough. Despite
recent assurances by the government, immigrant families are reluc-
tant to enroll their children in public programs for fear of becoming
a public charge, which could jeopardize their green cards, future
citizenship, and income.13 Nonfinancial barriers to care for foreign-
born children also need to be addressed, by ensuring that children
are connected to a continuous care source.
Changes in immigration policy at the federal level may also enable
access to health care for foreign-born children. Short of regularizing
the legal status of undocumented families, developing an agreement
with the government of Mexico to provide health insurance to guest
workers in the United States, strengthening the enforcement of
labor laws under the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), and subsidizing employers of working poor immigrants
so that they can afford to provide health insurance to their employ-
ees are policies that merit further consideration.
If Congress does not revise the policies that enable foreign-born
children to enroll in public health insurance programs, another op-
tion for states is to seek Section 1115 waivers from the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) to require less documentation
on immigration status for foreign-born children. Another option for
"Changes in immigration policy at the federal level may enable
access to health care for foreign-born children."

states, recognizing the political difficulty of changing these policies,
is to strengthen the safety net of public clinics and hospitals that
provide care for the uninsured.
Given the rapid influx of immigrants into the United
States, and their contributions to the U.S. labor market, it is
short-sighted to ignore the health care needs of foreign-born
children. Where a child is born and the income of his or her parents
should not be the major determinants of access to immunizations
against communicable diseases, regular check-ups to assess normal
growth and development, and access to medical treatment when ill
or injured. If the United States fails to extend health insurance
coverage to the foreign-born children of the working poor, the wide
disparities we have observed in their access to and use of health care
services will continue.
