Non-technical summary
Research Question
Can central banks increase inflation in the short run by increasing nominal interest
rates? Yes, according to the neo-Fisherian view. For central bankers this sounds odd,
since they widely believe that cutting interest rates increases inflation.
Contribution
In this primer we illustrate that the neo-Fisherian view critically hinges on equilibrium
selection and, more generally, on the formation of expectations. The neo-Fisherian view
is thus not compelling.
Results
We show, first, that the prototypical new-Keynesian model for monetary policy analysis
with a temporary fixed interest rate generates multiple equilibrium paths: some of them
are consistent with the neo-Fisherian view, others are not. Second, the unique optimal
monetary policy at the lower bound on interest rates, which can be implemented in the
model with interest rate rules and state-contingent forward guidance, does not result in a
paradoxical interest-inflation channel. Third, if one relaxes the assumption of perfect
foresight or rational expectations, the new-Keynesian model produces an equilibrium
that is not consistent with the new-Fisherian view.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Können Notenbanken in der kurzen Frist die Inflation erhöhen, wenn sie den
gelpolitischen Nominalzins anheben? Die neo-Fishersche Sicht (neo-Fisherian view),
bejaht dies. Dies sollte Notenbanker verblüffen, denn überwiegend wird eine
Zinssenkung zur Erhöhung der Inflation als zielführend gesehen.
Beitrag
In dieser Einführung zeigen wir, dass die neo-Fishersche Sichtweise wesentlich von der
Gleichgewichtsselektion abhängt und ­ allgemeiner ­ von der Erwartungsbildung der
Akteure. Wir erachten die neo-Fishersche Sichtweise daher nicht als zwingend.
Ergebnisse
Wir zeigen als erstes Resultat, dass das prototypische neu-Keynesiansche Modell mit
einem temporär fixierten Zinssatz (z.B. an der Zinsuntergrenze) ein Kontinuum an
Gleichgewichten impliziert. Manche dieser Gleichgewichte sind mit der neo-
Fisherschen Sichtweise kompatibel, andere sind es nicht. Zweitens, die eindeutig
bestimmte optimale Geldpolitik an der Zinsuntergrenze, implementiert durch eine
Zinsregel und zustandsabhängiger Forward-Guidance, weist keinen paradoxen Zins-
Inflationskanal auf. Drittens, weicht man von der üblichen Annahme der perfekten
Voraussicht oder rationaler Erwartungen ab, ergibt sich im neu-Keynesianischen Modell
ein Gleichgewicht, das nicht der neo-Fischerschen Sichtweise entspricht.

Abstract
The neo-Fisherian view does not consider a negative interest rate gap a prerequisite for boosting
inflation. Instead, a negative interest rate gap is said to lower inflation. We discuss this
counterintuitive response ­ known as the Fisher paradox ­ in a prototypical new-Keynesian
model. We draw the following conclusions. First, with a temporarily pegged nominal rate
during a liquidity trap (given an otherwise standard Taylor rule) the model generally produces
multiple equilibrium paths: some of these paths are consistent with the neo-Fisherian view,
others are not. Second, the unique optimal monetary policy at the lower bound on interest rates,
which can be implemented in the model with interest rate rules and state-contingent forward
guidance, does not result in a paradox. Third, if the assumption of perfect foresight or rational
expectations is relaxed, the model produces an equilibrium that is not consistent with the neo-
Fisherian view.

1 Introduction
It is widely accepted that a central bank should cut its policy rate rapidly and sharply in
response to an adverse shock. If the shock is large enough, the policy rate, in extreme
circumstances, will be brought down to the lower bound (which, for the sake of
simplicity, is set at zero). "Sooner or later", this kind of monetary policy (conditional on
how it is implemented) should lead to an upturn in aggregate demand and thus drive up
inflation.
However, despite the very expansionary monetary policy stance, particularly in the euro
area but also in the United States, no self-supporting rise in inflation can be identified to
date. It is commonly argued that this is because of a (temporarily) low natural rate of
interest.2 The argument holds that the natural rate of interest fell so sharply during the
Great Recession that even the current low real interest rates are still having a
contractionary effect, and that there is therefore a positive interest rate gap, ie
( ) ( ) ( ) 0
i t t r t

- - > , where ( )
r t denotes the natural interest rate.
An alternative explanation, which will be our main focus in this paper, is that a negative
interest rate gap is by no means a prerequisite for driving up inflation. Instead,
according to this view, a negative interest rate gap lowers inflation, thus reversing the
sign vis-à-vis the conventional interest rate channel. Such a counterintuitive response
from the inflation rate following a fall in the policy rate is known as Fisher paradox or
neo-Fisherianism.
The neo-Fisherian view holds that the long period of low interest rates itself contributed
to the fall in inflation and thus to the current low inflation rates. Thus the forward
guidance that policy rates would remain low for an extended period of time should have
steered inflation expectations towards deflation or at least disinflation. Conversely,
under the neo-Fisherian view the central banks should raise interest rates in order to
increase inflation. Prominent advocates of this view include John Cochrane and Stephen
Williamson.3

We discuss the neo-Fisherian view in a prototypical new-Keynesian model and come to
the following conclusions. First, with a temporarily pegged nominal rate during a
liquidity trap (given an otherwise standard Taylor rule) the model generally produces
multiple equilibrium paths: some of these paths are consistent with the neo-Fisherian
view, others are not. Second, the optimal monetary policy at the lower bound on interest
rates, which can be implemented in the model with interest rate rules and state-
contingent forward guidance, does not result in a paradox (see Duarte, 2016). Third, if
the assumption of perfect foresight or rational expectations is relaxed (either along the
lines of García-Schmidt and Woodford, 2015 or Gabaix, 2016), the model produces an
equilibrium that is not consistent with the neo-Fisherian view.
In related work Garín, Lester and Sims (2016) document how reducing the inherently
forward-looking nature of the standard new-Keynesian model also helps to escape the
Fisher paradox.
2 The Fisher paradox under perfect foresight and its
resolution
2.1 The problem of multiple equilibria
The academic debate about the neo-Fisherian view is based on the prototypical
(linearised) new-Keynesian model, which is composed of an IS and a Phillips curve,
( )
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ,
( ) ( ) ( ),
x t i t r t t
t t x t
 
 r 
= - -
= -


where ( )
x t and ( )
t
 denote the output gap and inflation, ( )
r t is the natural interest rate
and ( )
i t represents the nominal interest rate (the new-Keynesian model is shown here in
time-continuous form).4 In this model framework, the natural interest rate is assumed to
be exogenous and therefore independent of nominal interest rates (according to
conventional wisdom, the natural interest rate is independent of nominal factors).
If the zero lower bound is binding, the Taylor rule ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
x
i t t x t r t

  
= + + is
temporarily disabled; for a finite period the nominal interest rate becomes thus a fixed

variable (interest rate peg). Without an active Taylor rule (active implies
( / ) 1
x

   
+ > ), be it permanent or only temporary, the determinate stable equilibrium
is "lost", ie the prototypical two-equation new-Keynesian model then generally
produces multiple equilibrium paths.5 As is illustrated below, the differing points of
view on the aforementioned interest rate channel and thus the neo-Fisherian view are
closely connected with the existence of multiple equilibria.
Yet in the long run, at least on the basis of the new-Keynesian model, there is no
discord between the two points of view, as the long-term equilibrium level of inflation ­
for both the conventional and the neo-Fisherian views ­ can be described using the
Fisher equation (which, in turn, can be derived from the IS curve):
( ) ( ) ( ).
t i t r t
 = -
According to this, a lasting increase in nominal interest rates ­ for a given natural
interest rate ­ raises inflation. In the long term, Fisher neutrality therefore applies:
( ) ( )
d di
  =  .
Although "exact" Fisher neutrality cannot be observed empirically, higher nominal
interest rates are often accompanied by higher inflation (eg Evans, 1998). For the long
run, the neo-Fisherian view is therefore uncontroversial (eg Gabaix, 2016). However,
there is some dispute over whether the positive relationship between the level of
nominal interest rates and the level of inflation already applies in the short term.6 This
"wrong" sign vis-à-vis the conventional policy rate channel formally describes the
Fisher paradox.
Where does the Fisher paradox ­ and thus the difference of opinion regarding the short
term ­ originate? As mentioned above, the prototypical new-Keynesian model with a
temporary interest peg (given an otherwise applicable Taylor rule) generally produces
multiple equilibrium paths. Some of these paths are compatible with the paradox, ie
they model the neo-Fisherian view; others are not and thus model the conventional
policy rate channel. This means that the choice of equilibrium is critical to the existence
5 If the Taylor rule always holds and there is no lower bound on interest rates, there is a locally
determinate stable equilibrium (Duarte, 2016, p 23 and García-Schmidt and Woodford, 2015, p 16).
6 See the abstract in Cochrane (2016a: "If the Fed raises nominal interest rates, the [conventional new-
Keynesian] model predicts that inflation will smoothly rise, both in the short run and long run. [My]
paper presents a series of failed attempts to escape this prediction."
4
and thus the plausibility of the Fisher paradox. However, until it is "clarified" beyond
doubt what economic criteria should be applied when choosing from the many
equilibrium paths in the prototypical new-Keynesian model, the question of what
happens after an, say, interest rate hike cannot be answered conclusively.
From a mathematical point of view, the multiple equilibria in the present model
framework are the result of having "too many" degrees of freedom; in our prototypical
model these are two free constants, which are part of the solution to the two differential
equations of the prototypical new-Keynesian model.7 Depending on how these
constants are chosen, the model generates an equilibrium path that is either compatible
or incompatible with the Fisher paradox. Below, we therefore present a series of
alternatives for selecting equilibria (see also the mathematical annex) and explain the
implications that this selection has for the occurrence of the paradox.
There appears to be no consensus in the literature about the economic criteria for the
choice of "free" constants (see Cochrane, 2011). This explains why some prominent
economists consider the Fisher paradox to be plausible while others do not.
By way of example, Figure 1 shows nine equilibrium paths from a continuum of
equilibria which are all consistent with the same interest rate path. For the first five
years, a liquidity trap with a positive interest rate gap is assumed, ( ) ( ) 4%
i t r t
- =(for the
sake of simplicity, the inflation target is set at zero) where the nominal interest rate
( ) 0%
i t = and the natural interest rate ( ) 4%
r t = - . Following the liquidity trap, the
natural interest rate returns to the steady state and, accordingly, the central bank is able
to close the interest rate gap, meaning that ( ) ( )
i t r t
= applies following the liquidity trap.
For each of the stable equilibria modelled here, one of the free constants is calculated
with an additional condition for ( )
t
 at a given time t .8 The equilibrium accompanying
the conventional interest rate channel ­ indexed by ( ) 0
T

at the end of the liquidity trap, the central bank is aiming for and achieves the steady

constants.
8 The mathematical annex in Chapter 5 details how a free constant is calculated using such an additional
condition. Alternatively, an additional condition could be formulated for ( )
x t . The second free constant
can be calculated comparatively "uncontroversially" provided that, as is usual in the literature, the
analysis is restricted to those paths which are locally stable, ie the equilibria which are stable going
forwards in time and thus return to the steady state.

equilibrium (eg Werning, 2012) is accompanied by a deep recession and deflation. Such

deflation is not observed in the equilibria favoured by Cochrane (2016b), indexed by
( ) 0
 - = or (0) 0
 = .9 For both equilibrium paths, the inflation rates remain in or
above the steady state throughout and thus reflect the neo-Fisherian view. For these two
paths, the recession is less sharp and is followed by a boom at the end of the liquidity
trap. Cochrane (2016a) "justifies" these equilibria in part by pointing out that sharp
deflation was not observed in the United States after the onset of the crisis, thus
concluding that the conventional equilibrium and its implications were not plausible.10
2.2 One resolution of the paradox
One logical option for solving the problem of having multiple equilibria which is not
considered by Cochrane (2016a, 2016b) is to determine the optimal monetary policy ­
ie the one that maximises utility ­ because the optimal equilibrium is determinate (eg
Werning, 2012 and Duarte, 2016). For the continuous-time model, the initial conditions
that are consistent with the optimal monetary policy can be determined using the
maximum principle.
Direct implementation of the optimal monetary policy at the zero bound is not possible,
however, as knowledge of the optimal monetary policy does not per se provide any
indication of how it can be implemented in practice (a case in point is the targeting rule
under commitment, which basically only formulates how output and inflation can be
optimally managed). In other words, knowledge of the optimal and determinate
equilibrium ­ characterised by a certain output/inflation path ­ does not initially provide
any indication as to how this can be implemented via a monetary policy rule and
forward guidance.
If the central bank combines a monetary policy rule with calendar-based forward
guidance, it is not possible to implement the optimal monetary policy in a determinate
manner (Duarte, 2016, Proposition 1). The problem of selection and thus the existence
of multiple equilibrium paths therefore remains if forward guidance is calendar-based.
By contrast, if a monetary policy rule with state-contingent forward guidance is
implemented, it is possible to apply the optimal monetary policy as a determinate
9 For the equilibrium indexed by ( ) 0
 - = , the free constant is set to zero. See the mathematical annex in
Chapter 5.1.

empirical VAR studies (see Cochrane, 2016a).
7
equilibrium (Duarte, 2016, Chapter 5.2 and 5.3 shows interest rate rules of this kind).11
The optimal monetary policy has two characteristics. First, it implies that the policy rate
must be kept at the lower bound for longer than the actual shock lasts (see Figure 2).
This means that the interest rate gap for *
T t T
> > is negative, as the central bank
keeps the policy rate at the zero bound until *
T despite the natural interest rate being
positive. Only afterwards is the interest rate gap closed. The optimal time *
T for the
policy "lift-off" is state-contingent and is not given a priori.
Figure 2: Optimal determinate equilibrium under commitment
Notes: Figure 2 shows the optimal equilibrium path. Much like in Figure 1, between 0
t = and 5
t T
= = the
economy falls into a liquidity trap with ( ) 0
i t = and ( ) 4%
r t = - ; for *
T t T
> > the interest rate gap is negative, as
the central bank keeps the policy rate at the zero bound until *
T despite the natural interest rate being positive. Only
afterwards is the interest rate gap closed (ie the nominal rate is adjusted to the natural rate). The prototypical two-
equation model is calibrated as in Figure 1.
In addition, the initial response of inflation given the optimal monetary policy has the
"right" sign, ie a positive interest rate gap initially dampens the inflation rate. The
Fisher paradox thus cannot be observed (ironically, given the optimal monetary policy,
a positive inflation rate can also be observed in some phases of the liquidity trap.
11 For the new-Keynesian model in discrete time, see Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003, and Jung,
Teranishi and Watanabe, 2005.
8
However, this is not a general feature of the optimal policy but is due to the specific
calibration.)12
3 Fisher paradox vanishes without perfect foresight
An alternative option for solving the problem of equilibrium selection and thus avoiding
multiple equilibria is to modify the present underlying analytical framework, especially
the assumption of a perfect foresight equilibrium (PFE) or the "softening" of rational
expectations. A proposal of this sort was put forward by García-Schmidt and Woodford
(2015) (henceforth GSW). A different way of resolving the Fisher paradox focusses on
behavioural economic considerations, which we will briefly outline following GSW.
The foundation of the considerations of GSW is a new equilibrium concept which is no
longer based on the assumption of rational expectations but has an underlying "process
of reflection" (roughly, a way of learning); agents iteratively adapt their initial beliefs
until a PFE has (ideally) been reached. The underlying equilibrium concept is called
reflective equilibrium (see Woodford, 2013). The iterative process can, under certain
circumstances, converge towards one of the multiple equilibria. In this context, the
process of reflection thus takes on the equilibrium selection (the features of an
equilibrium selected in this way largely depend on the duration of the iteration process).
In the prototypical new-Keynesian two-equation model with a (temporary or permanent)
fixed nominal interest rate, the process of reflection converges at a slower pace than in
cases where the Taylor rule always applies. If the interest rate has been fixed for a
sufficient length of time, the reflective equilibrium does not at all converge towards one
of the multiple "rational" equilibria. It is therefore impossible to make an unambiguous
statement about the features of the equilibrium "determined" using the iterative process
because the features of the equilibrium determined in this way hinge on how long the
iterative process is permitted to last.
According to GSW, it is nevertheless possible to assess the equilibrium paths in
qualitative terms, if these were determined using the iterative process. Hence, according
to GSW, a temporarily constant interest rate generally leads to higher demand, which,
12 The calibration of the prototypical two equation model is based on Galí (2015). The calibration is
merely for illustrative purposes and does not purport to bring the model "as close as" possible to the data.
9
in turn, increases output and inflation.13 The reflective equilibrium thus does not run
into the Fisher paradox, which may be regarded as irrelevant in the context of this
approach; this is because of the fact that the PFE equilibrium paths compatible with the
paradox cannot be achieved iteratively. Similarly, if the interest rate is fixed for a very
long period, the Fisher paradox cannot be observed either (see GSW, chart 5 and
proposition 6).
An alternative way of resolving the paradox, which represents a somewhat less radical
deviation from the paradigm of perfect foresight or rational expectations, is based on
behavioural economics, but does not require a new equilibrium concept. In this type of
models agents are not completely rational and are "inattentive" to macroeconomic
indicators (bounded rationality).14 Based on this assumption, Gabaix (2016) derives a
modified IS and the Phillips curve
( )
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ,
( ) ( ) ( ),
x t x t i t r t t
t t x t
  
 r 
= + - -
= -



where merely the discount factor 0 1

<  is added to the IS equation as a model
parameter (in this set-up, the standard discount factor in the Phillips curve also changes;
" 

" is therefore used to make the distinction). If agents are sufficiently myopic, in
other words, if they have a high preference for the present (which is controlled via
discount factor  ), the solution of the above system of differential equation is stable and
unique. This solution contradicts the neo-Fisherian view (see Figure 3). In mathematical
terms, this is owed to the fact that all free constants can now be eliminated by
considering stable equilibria only.15 The Fisher paradox is thus also resolved in the
behavioural model of Gabaix (2016).
13 If the iterative process lasts long enough, the reflective equilibrium converges towards a unique PFE
(García-Schmidt and Woodford, 2015, proposition 4). This PFE is not compatible with the Fisher
paradox.
14 Empirical evidence for households' and corporations' "inattention" to macroeconomic indicators can
be found in Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) and Taubinsky and Rees-Jones (2015) as well as Caplin,
Dean and Martin (2011).

4 Assessment
This short note discusses the Fisher paradox based on the prototypical new-Keynesian
model using the liquidity trap as an example. The explanations in this paper are
intended to illustrate that the neo-Fisherian view is not an imperative implication of the
new-Keynesian model, but is related to the issue of equilibrium selection.
What are the advantages of selecting an equilibrium path that is compatible with the
neo-Fisherian view? According to Cochrane (2016b), it is not least the equilibrium
path's implications at the zero lower bound on interest rates that represent an advantage,
as it does not exhibit a deep and long-lasting recession or a pronounced deflation in the
liquidity trap. On the contrary, the inflation rates are consistently at or above the steady
state. In this sense, such equilibrium better describes the evidence than the "traditional"
equilibrium of the new-Keynesian model. However, the optimal monetary policy shows
similar implications for model dynamics at the zero lower bound without following the
11
logic of the neo-Fisherian view. As such, selecting the equilibrium which features the
Fisher paradox is anything but imperative.
Another argument against the paradox may be its lack of robustness. The work by both
GSW and Gabaix (2016) (among others) shows that the paradox disappears if the model
framework is adjusted, especially if the assumption of PFE or rational expectations is
abandoned or behavioural economic considerations are used as a basis in an otherwise
standard new-Keynesian model.
This yields two general insights, which go beyond the issues discussed here. First, any
analysis based on the new-Keynesian model and conducted at the zero lower bound
should, as a rule, be carefully and critically examined. Second, the profession already
has begun to (seriously) question one key assumptions of the new-Keynesian model ­
the assumption of rational expectations.

to use the deterministic (ie with perfect foresight) continuous-time version of the
prototypical new-Keynesian model for our analysis. This version of the model enables a
comparatively simple analytical solution to be found, especially when the focus is on
what is taking place at the zero lower bound with a fixed nominal interest rate.

where the parameters A and B can be determined in two stages. In the first stage, the

Because of the positive eigenvalue in 1
1
t
C e , the "forward"-looking path of ( )
t
 in (5) is
explosive if t   . The literature usually only considers stable forward-looking paths
(unless the focus is on so-called "bubble" solutions): the "free" constant is thus set to
zero ( 1
0
C = ). The "backward"-looking path of ( )
t
 in (6) explodes if t  - . If 0
t = ,
the "free" constant 2
C defines the initial condition (0)
 . As a rule, the free constant 2
C
(for 1
0
C = ) thus indexes the various equilibrium paths which are all consistent with the
same forcing variable ( )
z t . In line with the literature, we assume that 1
0
C = (in other
words, we observe only forward-stable paths) while 2
C initially remains a variable that
can be "freely" selected.
Inserting (5) and (6) into (8) gives us the following solution:

Liquidity trap and forward guidance
We extend the considerations above by a period  , in which we assume that the
economy has left the liquidity trap ( ( ) 0
r t r

nominal interest rate deliberately at the zero lower bound ( ( ) 0
i t = for 0 t T t

Optimal monetary policy
At time 0
t = , the point in time when the economy "steps" into the liquidity trap
( ( ) 0
i t = and ( ) 0
r t < ), the central bank chooses the optimal path for inflation and the
output gap in line with the following standard optimisation problem:
(13)

( )
0
( ), ( ), ( )
2 2

min ( ) ( )

-
=

subject to (12) and with the free initial conditions (0)
x , (0)
 (or, as an equivalent
alternative, the free constants 1
C and 2
C ). The central bank thus keeps any deviations
from zero (ie from the steady state) at a minimum for inflation and the output gap. The
parameter  controls the relative weight between the two targets.18
The minimisation problem stated above can be solved numerically using Pontryagin's
"Maximum Principle" (see Gandolfo, 1997, Chapter 22.1 and Werning, 2012).
5.2 The new-Keynesian "behavioural model"
Under the assumption that households and firms are not completely rational, Gabaix
(2016) derives the following modified IS and Phillips curves:
( )
1 1

.
t t t t t t t
f
t t t t
x i
ME x r E
M E x
 

  
+ +
+
- -
+
-
=
=
New additions to the formula are the discount factors M and f
M , where f
M is a
function of M and other structural parameters of the new-Keynesian model.
Transposed into the deterministic continuous-time version, this results in slight
modifications to the differential equations compared with (1)
18 In a prototypical new-Keynesian model, the quadratic loss function in (13) can be derived from a
second-order approximation of households' utility function (see Galí, 2015, Chapter 4).

where the discount factors are now defined by 1 M
 = - and 1 f
M
 
= -

in a departure
from the discrete-time version.
Using the same calculation rules as in the prototypical model, the following two
eigenvalues can be derived:
(15)
( )
( )
2
1

2
1
( ) 4( ) ( ) ,
2
1
( ) 4( ) ( ) .
2
      
      
+ + - + +
+ + - +
= -
=
  
  
In a departure from (4), the second eigenvalue can actually be negative, 2
0
 < , for
instance, if
(16) 1


>
 .
In such cases, the sign in the second bracket term in (3) changes "implicitly" and the
solution follows suit. This is no longer backward-looking, but now forward-looking just
as in (5). The counterpart to (6) in the "behavioural model" is thus as follows:
(17) 2 2 2
2
( )
( ) .
t t
s t
s
e e z s
C d
t e s
  
 
-
-
=
= + 
The main difference is therefore that the "second" free constant 2
C now also implies
forward-explosive dynamics. As in the prototypical model, excluding these solutions
yields 2
0
C = . Thus the differential equation system is uniquely determined by the given
forcing variable ( )
z t and shows no multiple forward-stable equilibria.
The solution is found in the same way as in the prototypical model, in other words by
inserting (5) and (17) into (8):
