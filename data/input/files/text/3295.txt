Abstract
We have previously identified a distinct class of antibodies expressed by B cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of early and
established relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients that is not observed in healthy donors. These antibodies
contain a unique pattern of mutations in six codons along VH
4 antibody genes that we termed the antibody gene signature
(AGS). In fact, patients who have such B cells in their CSF are identified as either having RRMS or developing RRMS in the
future. As mutations in antibody genes increase antibody affinity for particular antigens, the goal for this study was to
investigate whether AGSþ antibodies bind to brain tissue antigens. Single B cells were isolated from the CSF of 10 patients
with early or established RRMS. We chose 32 of these B cells that expressed antibodies enriched for the AGS for further
study. We generated monoclonal full-length recombinant human antibodies (rhAbs) and used both immunological assays and
immunohistochemistry to investigate the capacity of these AGSþ rhAbs to bind brain tissue antigens. AGSþ rhAbs did not
recognize myelin tracts in the corpus callosum. Instead, AGSþ rhAbs recognized neuronal nuclei and/or astrocytes, which are
prevalent in the cortical gray matter. This pattern was unique to the AGSþ antibodies from early and established RRMS
patients, as AGSþ antibodies from an early neuromyelitis optica patient did not display the same reactivity. Prevalence of CSF-
derived B cells expressing AGSþ antibodies that bind to these cell types may be an indicator of gray matter-directed
autoimmunity in early and established RRMS patients.

Introduction
B cells and antibodies are present in both the cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) and the central nervous system
(CNS) of patients with relapsing remitting multiple scler-
osis (RRMS), as well as clinically isolated syndrome
(CIS) patients who are at high risk of developing
RRMS (Krumbholz and Meinl, 2014). B cells are
involved in RRMS in multiple ways, including antigen
presentation and activation of T cells toward antigens
in the brain (Harp et al., 2010), production of proinflam-
matory cytokines (Ireland et al., 2012), and possibly the

production of autoantibodies. In addition, depletion of
B cells is an effective treatment for many RRMS patients
(Hauser et al., 2008).
The most common multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion is
characterized by deposition of both antibodies and com-
plement, and patients with this pattern of pathology can
improve with plasmapheresis treatment, which removes
circulating antibodies (Lucchinetti et al., 2000). In fact,
elevated B cells in the CSF correlate with lesion activity
on MRI (Cepok et al., 2005), and both increased intra-
thecal immunoglobulin synthesis (Sellebjerg et al., 2000)
and complement activation (Sellebjerg et al., 1998) are
also associated with a more aggressive disease course.
Sera from MS patients contain antibodies that mediate
damage in myelinating cultures containing astrocytes,
neurons, and oligodendrocytes (Elliott et al., 2012).
Collectively, these findings implicate a role for antibodies
in the pathoetiology of MS.
We recently discovered that B cells from the CSF of
early and established RRMS patients express a distinct
class of VH
4 antibody genes (Cameron et al., 2009;
Rounds et al., 2014). In fact, the prevalence of this dis-
tinct class of VH
4 antibody genes in the CSF-derived
B cell pool can support identification of patients who
either have or will develop RRMS with 85% to 94%
accuracy depending on the sequencing platform used
(Cameron et al., 2009; Rounds et al., 2014; Rounds
et al., 2015). What identifies this unique subclass of
VH
4 antibody genes is that they have acquired somatic
hypermutations (SHMs) at six codons (31b, 40, 56, 57,
81, and 89, Kabat numbering) within the variable region
at an excessive rate compared with controls. We call this
unusual antibody gene feature the antibody gene signa-
ture (AGS) for RRMS.
The purpose of SHM is to create B cells with higher
affinity for their antigen. After accumulating SHMs
in their immunoglobulin genes, B cells expressing antibo-
dies with higher affinity for their antigen outcompete their
sister cells for survival and activation signals. Considering
this, the enrichment of the AGS in CSF B cells of RRMS
patients could indicate a selection for B cells with affin-
ity for antigens prevalent in the brain. Therefore, we
hypothesized that AGSþ B cells may express antibodies
that bind to targets within the CNS. CNS tissue harbors
AGSþ B cells (Ligocki et al., 2010), and CSF B cells from
RRMS patients represent those that are found in the
tissue itself (Owens et al., 2003). Given this, we generated
32 full-length recombinant human antibodies (rhAbs)
from single AGSþ CSF B cells of 10 early or established
RRMS patients and two AGSþ CSF B cells from
1 patient with similar symptoms who converted to neu-
romyelitis optica (NMO).
Immunohistochemistry on both mouse and human
brain tissue demonstrated that 30 of the 32 AGSþ
rhAbs targeted cellular components of the cortex.
Immunofluorescence (IFC) confirmed the rhAbs bind
either astrocyte cell bodies and processes or neuronal
nuclei and, in some cases, bind both cellular targets.
This pattern was unique to the AGSþ antibodies from
early and established RRMS patients, as AGSþ antibo-
dies from an early NMO patient did not display the same
reactivity. This is the first known description of a distinct
class of RRMS-derived antibodies sharing a mutational
pattern that targets astrocytes and neurons. The preva-
lence of B cells expressing AGSþ antibodies may be an
indicator of gray matter-directed autoimmunity in early
and established RRMS patients.
Materials and Methods
Patient Sample Acquisition and Processing
CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture from patients
recruited in accordance with the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSWMC) institutional
review board. Patient summary is provided in Table 1.
This study includes patient samples as previously pub-
lished by our group (Cameron et al., 2009; Ligocki
et al., 2013) containing established CDMS patients (clin-
ically definite MS) with the relapsing remitting form
and early MS patients (CIS) with symptoms of either
optic neuritis (ONCIS
) or transverse myelitis (TMCIS
).
The ONCIS
and TMCIS
patients all had gadolinium-
enhancing lesions at the time of sampling and converted
to RRMS subsequent to the time of sampling, with
the exception of the one patient who converted to
NMO. The samples were stained with fluorescently
labeled antibodies and sorted for single CD19þ B cells
as previously described, into 96-well plates using either
the BD FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA) or the MoFlo High-Performance Cell
Sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO).
Single-Cell Polymerase Chain Reaction
and Genetic Analysis of Variable Heavy
and Variable Kappa Genes
After the single cell sort and cell lysis, antibody variable
regions were reverse transcribed from messenger RNA,
and genetic analyses were performed as previously
described (Ligocki et al., 2013). Antibody variable
heavy (VH
) and variable kappa (VK
) sequences were
analyzed and compiled using a Perl program developed
at UTSWMC (Ligocki et al., 2010; Ligocki et al., 2013)
using IMGT/V-QUEST as the initial source for
sequence alignment. AGS scores are determined by cal-
culating a Z score as a sum of (replacement mutation
frequency % À 1.6%) for each AGS codon (31b, 40, 56,
57, 81, and 89) divided by 0.9%, where replacement muta-
tion frequency percentage is calculated as replacement
2 ASN Neuro
mutations at a specific codon divided by total replacement
mutations (Cameron et al., 2009).
Cloning and Production of Full-Length Recombinant
Human Immunoglobin G Antibodies
Only those CSF B cells expressing the distinct VH
4
subclass of antibody genes with replacement mutations
at two or more of the six AGS codons (31b, 40, 56, 57,
81, and 89) were considered for cloning into full-length
expression vectors (i.e., ``AGSþ''; Supplemental Tables
1 and 2). These AGSþ rhAbs were cloned from 10 CSF
patient repertoires: 9 rhAbs from four established MS
patients, 23 rhAbs from six early MS patients, and 2
rhAbs from one early NMO patient, which served as
controls for the AGSþ rhAbs cloned from the early
and established MS patients. Sixty percent of the MS
and early MS rhAbs were clonally expanded and were
identified by the presence of another VH
sequence
within the same patient's antibody repertoire with iden-
tical amino acids in the third complementarity deter-
mining region (CDR3). The corresponding VK
sequence was amplified from the same well as the VH
sequence to identify the antibody binding region of the
single CSF B cell. Expression vectors for both the
Immunoglobin G and Immunoglobin kappa chains
and the procedure for production of monoclonal
human Immunoglobin G1
is well described (Tiller
et al., 2008). One additional control rhAb, B1, was
cloned from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
patient B cells and provided by Dr. Betty Diamond
as a construct control that does not bind to mouse
brain (Zhang et al., 2009). Production of monoclonal
rhAbs and their biotinylation procedure is detailed in
the Supplemental Methods.
Brain Tissue Processing and Immunohistochemistry
Detailed methodology for immunohistochemistry and
IFC to detect rhAb binding on brain tissue is provided
in the Supplemental Material. Notable differences
employed in this current study compared with previ-
ously used protocols (von Budingen et al., 2008;
Owens et al., 2009) are (a) the usage of 4% paraformal-
dehyde as a gentle fixative for previously frozen mater-
ial, rather than paraffin embedding and (b) staining
performed on both healthy and diseased white matter
(WM) and gray matter (GM) from both mouse and
human brain tissues. WM and GM were normal appear-
ing, with the exception of MS plaque tissue. Of note, the
presence of lipofuscin, which is typical for mature neu-
rons (Double et al., 2008), is detectable in some of the
human brain staining. Also, only the corticospinal sub-
class of neurons express YFP2.2 in the mice used for
IFC (Figure 9; Feng et al., 2000).
Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein, Myelin Basic
Protein, and Lysate ELISAs
The rhAbs were tested for binding to myelin oligodendro-
cyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic protein (MBP),
and tissue lysates (brain and kidney) by ELISA using

including MOG and MBP. Detailed methods are pro-

Results
AGSþ rhAbs Bind to Cellular Components
of the Cortical GM
As MS is considered a demyelinating disease (Hauser and
Oksenberg, 2006; Compston and Coles, 2008; Steinman,
2014; Ransohoff et al., 2015), we first sought to determine
whether the AGSþ rhAbs recognized components of the
corpus callosum, which is enriched for myelin tracts. To
do this, we utilized brain tissue from a mouse model of
transient stroke as a source of inflammation (Stowe et al.,
2011), which provided generalized non-antigen-directed
inflammation to minimize any potential bias of CNS anti-
gens. 3,30-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used to detect
binding to brain tissue of 32 AGSþ rhAbs from early
and established MS patients and 2 AGSþ rhAbs from a
patient with NMO. All but 2 of the 32 AGSþ rhAbs from
early and established MS patients (WR01 and WR11)
bound to mouse poststroke brain albeit with a wide
range of staining intensity (27 AGSþ rhAbs are shown
in Figure 1, and the remaining 5 are not shown).
However, binding to myelinated tracts in the corpus cal-
losum was either nonexistent or sporadic for all 32 AGSþ
rhAbs from MS patients. The 2 AGSþ rhAbs from an
NMO patient (R1 and R2) did not bind to any compo-
nent of the brain tissue.
Instead, the 30 positively staining AGSþ rhAbs that
demonstrated reactivity to the mouse stroke brain tissue
bound to cellular components of the cortical GM. This
binding preference was also confirmed in sections of
healthy mouse brain tissue and experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (mouse model of MS) brain tissue

AGSþ rhAbs, AJL10, demonstrated reactivity to healthy
mouse liver control tissue (Figure 2). The control rhAbs
(B1, R1, and R2) did not bind to either brain or liver
tissue (Figures 1 and 2).
AGSþ rhAbs Target Neurons and Astrocytes
in the Cortical GM
Due to the focused cellular binding in the cortical GM by
these AGSþ rhAbs from MS patients, we hypothesized
that the AGSþ rhAbs were binding to either neurons or
astrocytes in the cortex. Therefore, IFC colocalization
experiments were performed on a subset of AGSþ
rhAbs that demonstrated strong binding by DAB
(Figures 1 and 2). NeuN was utilized as a marker for
neuronal nuclei, and glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) was utilized as a marker for astrocytes. Figure
3 features three of these rhAbs that bound to neurons but
not astrocytes, Figure 4 features three of these rhAbs that
bound to astrocytes but not neurons, and Figure 5 fea-
tures four of these rhAbs that bound both neurons and
astrocytes. Negative control IFC using the B1, R1, and
R2 rhAbs are shown in Figure 3.
Three of the AGSþ rhAbs (AJL03, AJL10, and
AJL15) expressed by CSF-derived B cells from three dif-
ferent early MS patients colocalized with neuronal nuclei,
as demonstrated in Figure 3 (top panels). Each rhAb
contained replacement SHMs at two or more of the six
AGS codons (Supplemental Table 1). No additional
clones of AJL03 or AJL10 were detected in their respect-
ive patients' CSF, but additional clones of AJL15 were
detected. None of these rhAbs cross-reacted with astro-
cytes as demonstrated by the lack of colocalization with
the astrocyte specific antibody, GFAP (Figure 3, bottom
panels). The control rhAbs (B1, R1, and R2) did not
colocalize with NeuN or GFAP (Figure 3, Panels D­F).
Three different AGSþ rhAbs (AJL01, WR12, and
WR13) expressed by CSF-derived B cells from early MS
patients colocalized with the astrocyte specific antibody
GFAP, as shown in Figure 4 (top panels). WR12 and
WR13 were from the same patient, but AJL01 was from a
different patient. Each rhAb contained replacement SHMs
at two or more of the six AGS codons (Supplemental Table
1), and all three rhAbs had additional clones detected in
their respective patients' CSF. None of these rhAbs cross-
reacted with neuronal nuclei as demonstrated by the lack of
colocalization with NeuN (Figure 4, bottom panels).
Four remaining AGSþ rhAbs (AJL02, AJL07, AJL19,
and WR10) expressed by CSF-derived B cells from early
MS patients colocalized with both neurons (Figure 5, top
panels) and astrocytes (Figure 5, bottom panels). Like the
previous rhAbs, these rhAbs contained replacement
SHMs at two or more of the six AGS codons

cloned from different patients, three of the four rhAbs
(AJL07, AJL19, and WR10) had additional clones
detected in their respective patients' CSF.
These 10 rhAbs that bound to either neurons or astro-
cytes in mouse brain tissue were tested for binding of
human brain tissue (Figure 6). All 10 AGSþ rhAbs recog-
nized cellular targets in the cortical GM from fixed brain
tissue of an MS patient (Figure 6(a)) and a healthy donor
unfixed cortical GM (Figure 6(b)). However, none of the
AGSþ rhAbs recognized cellular targets in the fixed WM of
an MS patient (Figure 6(c)) or fixed WM of a healthy donor
(Figure 6(d)). Minimal recognition of fixed plaque tissue of
an MS patient was observed for all AGSþ rhAbs (Figure
6(e)). Cellular targets of human GM were identified with
colocalization experiments using NeuN and GFAP to rep-
licate what was done in mouse tissue (Figures 3­5). All 10
AGSþ rhAbs recognized either neuronal nuclei or astro-
cytes in human brain tissue as demonstrated by colocaliza-
tion with either NeuN or GFAP (Figure 7).
AGSþ rhAbs Do Not Bind to Common Myelin
Antigens
We used ELISA, myelin array, and flow cytometry
(Figure 8) to evaluate binding of the AGSþ rhAbs to
the well-known myelin antigens, MBP and MOG
(Fraussen, Claes, de Bock, & Somers, 2014). With the
exception of AJL01, which was reactive to both MBP
and MOG by ELISA, all of the remaining AGSþ
rhAbs that we tested did not bind MBP or MOG
by ELISA (Figure 8(a) and (b)) or by myelin array
(Figure 8(c)). Finally, none of the AGSþ rhAbs that we
tested reacted to MOG expressed on the cell surface of
HeLa cells as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 8(d)).
As the majority of AGSþ rhAbs did not bind to the
common myelin antigens, we next sought to confirm this
by staining myelin tracts in the corpus callosum simul-
taneously with one of the AGSþ rhAbs. Brain slices from
mice whose corticospinal neurons express YFP2.2 (Feng
et al., 2000) were dual stained with a commercial anti-
MBP antibody and the AGSþ rhAb AJL10 that did not
bind to MBP or MOG in the myelin assays (Figure 8).
As illustrated in Figure 9, the WM tracts in the corpus
callosum were readily identifiable using the anti-MBP
antibody colocalized with YFP-expressing axons (Panel
B, 10Â magnification; Panel F, 63Â magnification).
AJL10 did not bind to myelin tracts in the corpus callo-
sum, but instead, bound to cellular components in the
cortex (Panels C and G), with specific colocalization to
layer V neuronal nuclei. Given the prevalence of NeuN

and AJL10 colocalization in Figure 3, many of the other
nuclei identified may belong to other subclasses of neu-
rons, including interneurons.
To determine whether these AGSþ rhAbs bind
CNS-specific antigens or antigens expressed in other tis-
sues, ELISAs on tissue lysates from wild-type mice were
performed. Many of the AGSþ rhAbs colocalized with
nuclei, much like antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) found in
other autoimmune diseases such as SLE. As deposition of
ANAs in the kidneys of SLE patients often leads to glom-
erulonephritis (acute inflammation of the kidney), we
tested our AGSþ rhAbs for binding to kidney lysate in
comparison to brain lysate. But unlike SLE ANAs,
the AGSþ rhAbs from these patients showed specificity
for brain proteins over kidney proteins (Figure 9(i)).
For example, AJL10 bound to mouse brain lysate
antigens with five times greater signal compared to
mouse kidney lysate.
Discussion
In this study, we used AGS enrichment as the selection
criteria for rhAb generation, as this distinct class of anti-
bodies is unique to B cells in the CSF (Cameron et al.,
2009; Rounds et al., 2014; Rounds et al., 2015), and brain
tissue (Ligocki et al., 2010) of established and early MS
patients with evidence of MRI activity. Previously, our
laboratory (Lambracht-Washington et al., 2007) and
others (Yu et al., 2006; von Budingen et al., 2008;
Owens et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2011) chose antibodies to
generate in the laboratory based on whether the CSF-
derived B cell had undergone clonal expansion or had

differentiated to an antibody secreting plasma cell.
Yu et al. identified peptide targets of 10 rhAbs generated
from plasma cells of two MS patients, none of which
demonstrated homology to any known human proteins,
including myelin components (Yu et al., 2006). von
Budingen et al. demonstrated that eight of nine rhAbs
generated from clonally expanded plasma cells of four
MS patients recognized myelin in MS lesion tissue, but
reactivity was not to the well-characterized myelin anti-
gens, MBP, MOG, or proteolipid protein (Von Budingen
et al., 2008). Interestingly, one of these nine rhAbs recog-
nized astroglia in MS lesion tissue. Finally, Owens and
Bennett demonstrated that 53 rhAbs generated from
plasma cells of nine MS patients did not recognize indi-
vidual myelin antigens using multiple immunoassays
(Owens et al., 2009). Interestingly, two of these rhAbs
recognized neuronal nuclei in MS brain tissue. Taken
together, these data indicate that neither myelin-asso-
ciated or non-myelin antigens can be ruled out as possible
targets of antibodies produced by plasma cells in the CSF
of MS patients.
For this study, we exclusively chose only those CSF-
derived CD19þ B cells that expressed AGSþ antibodies,
which are enriched in the CSF of RRMS patients. Indeed,
RRMS patients or patients who will develop RRMS in
the future can be identified by the prevalence of AGSþ B
cells in their CSF (Cameron et al., 2009). We generated 32
AGSþ rhAbs from 10 early and established MS patients
and 2 AGSþ rhAbs from one early NMO patient. DAB
staining of the AGSþ rhAbs from the early and estab-
lished MS patients showed binding to cellular compo-

axonal tracks, as well as high reactivity in the MBP and
MOG ELISA, myelin array, and MOG-focused flow
cytometry assays. Instead, we did not observe dominant
reactivity by these AGSþ rhAbs to any WM component
as emphasized by the dual tissue staining of the AGSþ
rhAb, AJL10, with a commercial anti-MBP antibody
(Figure 9).
We did, however, find that the AGSþ rhAbs bound
to cellular structures in the cortical GM. Interestingly,
GM pathology has recently gained appreciation for
involvement in MS symptoms and disease progression
(Bo et al., 2003; Fisniku et al., 2008; Rudick et al.,
2009; Calabrese et al., 2010; Magliozzi et al., 2010;
Howell et al., 2011; Schlaeger et al., 2014; Calabrese
et al., 2015; Jehna et al., 2015; Kawachi and Nishizawa,
2015; van Munster et al., 2015). More than 50% of all
GM-related manuscripts available over the last three dec-
ades were published in the last 5 years; decreasing the
WM:GM publication ratio to 2.6 compared with 4.9 in
the previous two decades. These studies have demon-
strated that lesions are more extensive in the GM than
in the WM (26.5% vs. 6.5%), such that GM pathology
increases with disability and disease length (Bo et al.,
2003). Progressive GM loss over time occurs at both
the early and established MS stages (Chard et al., 2004;
Valsasina et al., 2005), which suggest that the underlying
pathology responsible for the loss is not restricted to
either later disease stages or the WM myelin tracts.
Indeed, others have demonstrated that myelin loss in
MS can occur secondary to axonal and neuronal
damage (Trapp et al., 1998), and a loss of neuronal pre-
cursors can reduce the ability of oligodendrocytes to
remyelinate (Einstein et al., 2009). More recently, others
have begun to dissect the interaction of T cells with glia in
the mouse model of MS (Huseby et al., 2015) and in
humans, GM atrophy was higher in patients with evi-
dence of disease activity (Freeman et al., 2015; Nygaard
et al., 2015).
As the AGSþ rhAbs described in the present study
were cloned from B cells in the CSF, which is in close
contact with the meninges, the antibodies produced
by these AGSþ B cells may be strategically located to
contribute to GM neuronal damage. For example, anti-
bodies in MS CSF recognize neurofilaments, which com-
prise the axonal/neuronal cytoskeleton (Fialova et al.,
2013). Immunizing mice with neurofilament results in
deposition of IgG within neuronal cell bodies and
axons and subsequent GM damage (Huizinga et al.,
2007). Coincubation of CSF from aggressive MS with
neurons in vitro induced cell damage, transected axons,
and correlated with poor recovery post relapse (Cid et al.,
2002).
There were four AGSþ rhAbs that did not recognize
components of the brain tissue, which was surprising to
us, as they all carry two or more replacement mutations
in the AGS codons. Two of these AGSþ rhAbs that did

not bind brain tissue were from early MS patients (WR01
and WR11) and two were from an early NMO patient
(R1 and R2). However, we had previously noted
(Cameron et al., 2009) that VH
4þ B cells from the CSF
of MS patients had a depressed accumulation of SHM at
codons 30, 43, 77, and 82. We considered that replace-
ment mutations at these four ``cold spots'' may extinguish
binding to CNS components. Indeed, upon closer exam-
ination of these four AGSþ rhAbs' antibody genetics, we
noticed that three of them had accumulated replacement
mutations at one of more of these cold spots. The AGSþ
rhAb from an early NMO patient, R1, had not, but it is
possible that there are other cold spots in the VH
4 anti-
body rearrangements that counteract binding to CNS
components that we could not identify due to the small
sample size of that data set. Further characterization of
the binding specificity of these AGSþ rhAbs would need
to be done to clarify this issue.

coronal sections. The AGSþ rhAbs were queried for binding to mouse brain lysate by ELISA (Panel I) using mouse kidney lysate as a control
antigen pool. Data are shown as mean and standard deviation of two separate assays with secondary only antibody absorbance subtracted.

Many of the AGSþ rhAbs that were investigated in
this study colocalized with neuronal nuclei or appear to
be binding intracellular components of neurons and
astrocytes. However, unlike ANAs from lupus patients,
the majority of these AGSþ rhAbs were not reactive to
nuclei in liver tissue and had higher affinity for brain
extract than kidney extract, indicating their specificity
for CNS tissue. There are many known proteins that
are expressed specifically in the nuclei of neurons
(Maroteaux et al., 1988; Cohen and Roenigk, 1991;
Matsuoka et al., 1994; Sakakibara et al., 1996; Coy
et al., 2002; Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2010) and some
of these are antigenic targets in other neurological dis-
orders such as paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus
ataxia (Buckanovich et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1998) and
paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (Levine et al., 1993;
Darnell, 1996; Rauer and Kaiser, 2000) that can cause
damage to cells in vitro (Graus et al., 1991; Greenlee
et al., 1993). Multiple autoimmune diseases have autoan-
tibodies to intracellular antigens and ANAs including
systemic sclerosis, SLE, Sjo
¨ gren's syndrome, mixed con-
nective tissue disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (Racanelli
et al., 2011). While it is currently unknown how autoan-
tibodies to intracellular antigens contribute to disease,
there is often a correlation between particular antibodies
and involvement of specific organs, disease activity, or
even prognosis (Racanelli et al., 2011). Autoantibodies
to intracellular antigens may enter cells through recep-
tor-mediated entry (Yanase et al., 1997), endocytosis
(Jang et al., 2009), or even electrostatic interactions
with membrane proteins (Song et al., 2008) and
exhibit cytotoxic effects (Song et al., 2008; Jang et al.,
2009).
Despite numerous examples of how antibodies may
contribute to MS pathology, it remains unclear whether
this distinct class of AGSþ antibodies we presented here
will display a similar pathological capacity. Nevertheless,
these results suggest that this distinct class of AGSþ
antibodies may be an indicator of cortical GM-directed
autoimmunity in early and established MS patients.
Understanding early disease progression and identifying
novel therapeutic targets will optimize treatment for MS,
a disease that globally affects millions of people, while
establishing mechanisms for study in other autoimmune
diseases of the CNS.
Summary
B cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with early and estab-
lished relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis make a distinct class of
antibodies that bind to areas of the brain that have not been trad-
itionally investigated in this disease.
