mechanism of oridonin-
induced apoptosis in human
squamous cell oesophageal
carcinoma cell line EC9706
Jun-bao Liu1 and Jing-yu Yue2,3
Abstract
Objective: To study the apoptosis-inducing effect of the Chinese medicine oridonin in the human
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line EC9706, in vitro.
Methods: The effect of oridonin on cell proliferation was studied using the colorimetric 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Effects on the cell cycle and
apoptosis were studied by flow cytometry; effects on intracellular Ca2þ concentration were
studied by measuring the fluorescence intensity of a fluorescent Ca2þ probe by laser scanning
confocal microscopy.
Results: The EC9706 cell-proliferation rate decreased with time and oridonin concentration
(10­40 mmol/l). The number of cells in G0
and G1
phases increased significantly following exposure
to oridonin for 48 and 72 h respectively, and oridonin was shown to be most effective at inducing
apoptosis in EC9706 cells at 40 mmol/l. Compared with the control group, all concentrations
of oridonin tested (10­40 mmol/l) significantly increased the Ca2þ fluorescence intensity of
EC9706 cells.
Conclusions: Oridonin was shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in the human
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line EC9706, in vitro. These data provide preliminary
experimental evidence for the anticancer effects of oridonin, which is as a traditional Chinese
medicine used to treat various cancers, including oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Further
studies are required to elucidate the mode of action.

Introduction
Oesophageal carcinoma is a common malig-
nant tumour of the digestive system; world-
wide there are 450 000 new cases annually
and the fatality rate ranks sixth among
malignant neoplasms.1 In Henan Province,
China, the areas with highest oesophageal
carcinoma incidence and mortality rates are
Linzhou, Anyang and Huixian.2 Traditional
Chinese medicine has unique advantages in
the treatment of oesophageal carcinoma,
such as inhibition of carcinoma growth,
slowing of progression through the clinical
stages, prolonging patient survival and
improving health-related quality-of-life.3
Oridonin is a tetracyclic diterpenoid com-
pound based on the kaurene skeleton,
extracted from the herb Rabdosia rubescens4
and developed for medical use by Chinese
researchers.
The present study aimed to provide an
experimental basis for the clinical treatment
of oesophageal carcinoma with oridonin, by
investigating its apoptosis-inducing effect on
the oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma
cell line EC9706 in vitro, and exploring the
mechanism of this effect.
Materials and methods

EC9706 cells (Biological Engineering
Technology Research Centre of Henan
Province; Zhenghou City, Henan, China);
oridonin with 98% purity (Boxing Biotech-
nology, Zhengzhou City, Henan, China);
trypsin/ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid
(EDTA), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) (Beijing Solarbio, Beijing, China);
RPMI 1640 medium (Beijing Tianyi Science
company, Beijing, China); mycoplasma-free
newborn bovine serum (Hangzhou Tian-
hang Biotechnology, Hangzhou, China);
5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) Cell Pro-
liferation Assay Kit for flow cytometry
(Nanjing KeyGen Biotechnology Co. Ltd.,
Nanjing, China); annexin-V fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit
(KGA108; Biosynthesis Biotechnology, Bei-
jing, China); calcium fluorescence probe

Á6H2
O and 0.5 g glucose were dis-
solved in 400 ml ultrapure water and the pH
was adjusted to 7.4 at a constant volume of
500 ml; the solution was sterilized by filtra-
tion with a 0.22 -mm porosity membrane,
and stored at 4C until use.
Experimental groups
Each well in the oridonin groups contained
EC9706 cells, culture medium (DMEM with
10% newborn bovine serum) and oridonin
at final concentrations of 10, 20 or 40 mmol/l.
Blank control wells contained EC9706 cells
and culture medium (DMEM with 10%
newborn bovine serum).
Cell culture
The EC9706 cells (provided by Henan
Biology Engineering Technology Research
Centre) were routinely cultured in DMEM
with 10% mycoplasma-free newborn bovine
serum, and incubated at 37C/5% CO2
with
Liu and Yue 985
95% relative humidity. Subconfluent cells
were passaged every 2­3 days by incubating
with 0.2% trypsin/EDTA for 12 min at
37C. Cells were routinely seeded at 5 Â 104
cells/ml (16 ml into a 75 cm2 culture flask)
and the culture medium was changed on
alternate days.
MTT proliferation assay
The EC9706 cells in logarithmic phase were
routinely digested using 0.2% trypsin/EDTA
(12 min at 37C) and prepared as single-cell
suspensions containing 50 000 cells/ml. Each
well of a 96-well plate was seeded with 200 ml
of the cell suspension (1 Â 104 cells/well), and
the cells were incubated at 37C/5% CO2
for
24 h. The culture medium was then replaced
with 200 ml of culture medium containing
oridonin at 10, 20 or 40 mmol/l, or blank
control medium, with five replicates for each
condition. All 96-well plates were incubated
at 37C/5% CO2
for 24, 48, 72 or 96 h after
which the culture medium was discarded and
replaced with 180 ml of RPMI 1640 medium
and 20 ml of MTT solution. Following incu-
bation at 37C/5% CO2
for a further 4 h, the
supernatant was discarded, dimethyl sulph-
oxide (DMSO) was added at 150 ml/well, and
the plates were shaken for 10 min on a table
concentrator. The optical density (OD) of
each well was determined with a microplate
reader (Lifecare Medical Equipments.,
Ningbo, Zhejiang, China) set at 490 nm
wavelength. The rate of inhibition of prolif-
eration was calculated using the following
formula: inhibition rate (%) ¼ (OD of blank
control group À OD of drug test group)/OD
of blank control group Â 100.5 Tests were
repeated three times for each group.
Morphological analyses
Suspensions of EC9706 cells in logarithmic
phase were seeded into 25 cm2 culture flasks
(5 ml, 1 Â 108 cells/flask) in DMEM with
10% newborn bovine serum and incubated
for 24 h at 37C/5% CO2
, to allow cells to
adhere. The medium was then replaced with
5 ml DMEM with 10% newborn bovine
serum (blank control) or complete medium
(DMEM with 10% newborn bovine serum)
containing oridonin at 10, 20 or 40 mmol/l
final concentration and the cells were incu-
bated for 48 h at 37C/5% CO2
. Cells in
logarithmic growth were observed for mor-
phological characteristics using an inverted
optical microscope (Olympus 11389-210;
Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Flow cytometry measurements of cell cycle
and apoptosis
Suspensions of EC9706 cells in logarithmic
phase were seeded into 25 cm2 culture flasks
(5 ml, 5 Â 104 cells/ml) in DMEM with 10%
newborn bovine serum and incubated for
24 h at 37C/5% CO2
, to allow cells to
adhere. The medium was then replaced
with 5 ml DMEM with 10% newborn
bovine serum (blank control) or medium
(DMEM with 10% newborn bovine serum)
containing oridonin at 10, 20 or 40 mmol/l
final concentration. After incubation for 48
or 72 h at 37C/5% CO2
, the cells were
digested with 0.2% trypsin/EDTA (12 min
at 37C), washed twice with 0.2 mol/l phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), centri-
fuged for 5 min at 372 g, and resuspended to
a concentration of 1 Â 106 cells/ml. Within
1 h of resuspending, the cell-cycle stage and
presence of apoptosis were evaluated by flow
cytometry (EPICSÕ AltraTM flow cyt-
ometer; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA)
according to the instructions provided with
the BrdU cell proliferation assay kit and
annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit,
respectively.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy for
detection of intracellular free calcium
The calcium fluorescence probe fluo-3/AM
was prepared as a 5-mmol/l solution in
986 Journal of International Medical Research 42(4)
DMSO, and the chaotropic agent F-127
(Biotium) was dissolved in DMSO to a
final mass-to-volume ratio of 20%. The
two prepared solutions (200 ml of each)
were mixed with 12.5 ml RPMI 1640 and
stored in the dark at À20C prior to use.
Suspensions of EC9706 cells in logarithmic
phase were seeded into 96-well plates
(5 Â 103 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h
at 37C/5% CO2
to allow cells to adhere.
The medium was then replaced with 200 ml
DMEM containing 10% newborn bovine
serum (blank control) or medium (DMEM
with 10% newborn bovine serum) contain-
ing oridonin at 10, 20 or 40 mmol/l final
concentration, and the cells were incubated
for 2 h at 37C/5% CO2
. At the end of the
incubation period, cells were washed three
times with 1 ml of calcium-free Tyrode's
solution. The fluo-3/AM and F-127 solution
(200 ml) was then added to the central circu-
lar groove of the 96-well plate and the
solution was incubated for 30 min in dark-
ness at 37C to allow absorption of the
loading solution.
Following three washes with calcium-free
Tyrode's solution and adding 200 ml cal-
cium-free Tyrode's solution to the groove of
each well, the intracellular free Ca2þ con-
centration ([Ca2þ]i
) was determined by con-
focal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss
Optics Instruments [Shanghai] International
Trade Co., Shanghai, China). EC9706 cells
loaded with fluo-3/AM were placed on the
microscope's loading platform and the focus
was adjusted to make the image as clear as
possible. Cells with a structured rather than
irregular shape were selected for observa-
tion. The specimen was first pre-scanned
with a low-speed argon ion laser, then
properly scanned when a clear view had
been obtained. The same parameters were
used for all scans. Following the technique
described previously,6 six to eight views in
all experimental groups were selected, each
view including five cells. The cells were
subjected to fluorescence intensity analysis
and curves showing the change in fluores-
cence intensity of the Ca2þ indicator over
time were generated. FV10-ASW Viewer
software, version 1.6 (Zeiss Optics Instru-
ments [Shanghai] International Trade Co.)
was used to calculate the average fluores-
cence intensity value (arbitrary units); the
greater the fluorescence intensity, the higher
the [Ca2þ]i
.
Statistical analyses
All experimental data were analysed with
SPSSÕ software, version 18.0 (SPSSÕ,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed
as mean Æ SD, and analysis of variance was
used to compare intra- and intergroup dif-
ferences. A P-value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Cell proliferation and morphology
Oridonin inhibited the proliferation of
EC9706 cells. Observation of the cells
under an inverted microscope showed that
cells exposed to oridonin for 48 h had
changed from a shuttle-like to an irregular
form, and that cell density was low with
increased intercellular spaces. Some cells
had become rounded, detached floating
cells were observed, and some cells were
vacuolated. Part of the cell membrane had
contracted and had a foamy appearance, a
small number of cells showed a pyknotic
state with a translucent round or oval shape
and individual cells were small (Figure 1).
Incubation with oridonin for 24 h was
shown to inhibit the rate of EC9706 cell
proliferation by 19.45 Æ 2.34%, 41.38 Æ
3.32% and 78.83 Æ 4.99% (10 mmol/l,
20 mmol/l and 40 mmol/l oridonin), respect-
ively. Differences in rates of inhibition were
statistically significant compared with the
control group at all oridonin concentrations
(P ¼ 0.0001). In terms of antiproliferation
effect, the IC50
for oridonin incubated with
Liu and Yue 987
EC9706 cells for 48 h was 21.48 Æ 1.43 mmol/
l. Inhibition of proliferation was observed
in EC9706 cells incubated with oridonin
for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h at 10, 20 and
40 mmol/l (Table 1).
Cell-cycle phases and apoptosis
Following 48 h of exposure to oridonin, the
percentage of cells in G1
/G0
phase was
significantly higher than in the control
group for all oridonin concentrations
(P < 0.05; Table 2), and the percentage of
cells in G1
/G0
phase was significantly higher
in the 40 mmol/l oridonin group than in the
20 and 10 mmol/l oridonin groups (P < 0.05).
The percentage of cells in S phase was
significantly lower in the 40 mmol/l oridonin
group than in the control group and 10
and 20 mmol/l oridonin groups (P < 0.05;
Figure 2 and Table 2). The percentage of
cells in G2
/M phase was significantly lower
in the 40 mmol/l oridonin group than in the
control group (P < 0.05; Table 2).
Following 72 h of exposure to oridonin,
the percentage of cells in G1/
G0
phase was
significantly higher, and the percentage of
cells in the S and G2
phases were signifi-
cantly lower, in the 40 and 20 mmol/l
oridonin groups than in the control group
(P < 0.001); the difference was greatest in the
40 mmol/l oridonin group.
The apoptosis rate in all oridonin groups
was significantly higher than in the control
group at both 48 h (Figure 3) and 72 h (data
not shown) (P < 0.001), and the apoptosis
rate in the 40 mmol/l oridonin group was
significantly higher than in the 10 and
20 mmol/l oridonin groups (P < 0.05).

Intracellular free calcium
From the beginning of the scanning period,
the fluorescence intensity of the cultures
incubated with oridonin increased at a sig-
nificantly higher rate than the control group
(P < 0.05; Table 3). Intracellular free cal-
cium fluorescence intensities were signifi-
cantly higher in all groups exposed to
oridonin for 2 h compared with the control
group (P < 0.05; Table 3).
Discussion
The aetiology and underlying molecular
mechanisms of oesophageal carcinoma
onset and progression remain unknown.
Principle treatment strategies include
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and
biotherapy, and there are currently no
effective preventive measures and no specific
diagnostic index or methods. The morbidity
and fatality rates, therefore, cannot be
effectively controlled. Traditional Chinese
medicine has few toxic and adverse effects in
the treatment of oesophageal carcinoma,
whether in single use or combined with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy.7 In the
treatment of oesophageal carcinoma, certain
forms of traditional Chinese medicine can
improve dysphagia, relieve cancer pain,
enhance immunity, reduce tumour volume,
improve the general state of the body,

Oridonin has inhibitory effects on various
malignant tumour cells,9­11 and its thera-
peutic effect on solid tumours has been
widely used clinically, especially in the treat-
ment of oesophageal carcinoma7 and gastric
tumours (author's personal communica-
tion), with notable clinical success. The
in vitro antitumour effects of oridonin have
been shown against cell lines derived from
cancers such as those of the lung, prostate
and breast.10 Oridonin has been shown to
induce human cancer-cell apoptosis, with
mitochondrial hyperplasia and swelling
observed in the early stage of apoptosis.10,12
The herb Rabdosia rubescens, from which
oridonin is extracted, has been shown to
inhibit the synthesis of DNA and RNA,13,14
its target being DNA polymerase.15 The
mechanism of antitumour activity may
involve an effect on apoptosis through
actions such as decreasing the expression
level of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukae-
mia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and activation of
the caspase pathway,16,17 in which telomer-
ase is closely involed,18 but also by increas-
ing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.13
Oridonin is also thought to affect intracel-
lular signal transduction.19

cells in vitro, with peak hypodiploid detec-
tion observed following 48 h of exposure,
and a concentration-dependent proapopto-
tic effect. These results are consistent with
the apoptosis-inducing effect of oridonin
shown in other tumour cells.9,16
In the present study, oridonin inhibited
the proliferation of oesophageal squamous
cell carcinoma EC9706 cells in vitro.
Furthermore, increases in cytoplasmic intra-
cellular free calcium (measured by laser
scanning confocal microscopy) were seen
to correspond with EC9706 cells blocked at
the G1
or G2
/M phases of the cell cycle
(measured by flow cytometry), in response
to incubation with oridonin. It may be that
oridonin inhibits EC9706 cell proliferation
through interaction with membrane calcium
transport systems or activation of the apop-
tosis signal transduction pathway. Further
studies are required to understand the mech-
anism by which oridonin inhibits prolifer-
ation and induces apoptosis in oesophageal
cancer cells.
