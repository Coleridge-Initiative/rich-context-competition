PARENTS and grown children often describe feelings of
love as well as tension with one another (Connidis &
McMullin, 2002; Luescher & Pillemer, 1998). The intergen-
erational stake hypothesis suggests that these feelings vary
within families by generation with older generations report-
ing greater positive quality and lower negative quality than
younger generations (Bengtson & Kuypers, 1971). In con-
trast, family systems theorists propose that transmission of
interaction patterns across generations leads to similarities in
emotional experience among family members (Bowen, 1978;
Fingerman & Bermann, 2000). For example, grandparents
who feel highly negative regarding their middle-aged chil-
dren may in turn foster feelings of negativity between their
middle-aged children and their grandchildren. Yet, studies
of intergenerational relationship quality typically examine
only one or two generations (Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz,
Birditt, & Mroczek, 2008; Pillemer & Suitor, 2002; Pillemer
et al., 2007) and so have not tested hypotheses about differ-
ences or transmission across three generations of family
members. This investigation is particularly relevant because
relationship quality is associated with health and well-being
and increases the likelihood that support will be available in
times of need (Fingerman et al., 2008; Fingerman et al., 2011;
Lowenstein, 2007; Luescher & Pillemer, 1998; Ward, 2008).
This study extends previous literature by examining
possible generation differences or transmission of positive
and negative relationship quality among three generations
of family members. We use standard nomenclature in the
social sciences and refer to the grandparent generation as
G1, the middle generation as G2, and the children as G3.
Positive and Negative Qualities and the Intergenerational
Stake Hypothesis
Prior to the late 1990s, the solidarity and interpersonal
conflict perspectives dominated the intergenerational
literature; these distinct perspectives examined positive or
negative qualities of relationships in isolation (Bengtson,
Giarrusso, Mabry, & Silverstein, 2002). According to soli-
darity theory, intergenerational relationships vary in levels
of affective solidarity. That is, there is a range in positive
feelings between parents and children, including the extent
to which they experience feelings of love, caring, and under-
standing in the relationship. The concept of the intergenera-
tional stake emerged from solidarity theory suggesting that
parents are more emotionally invested in the relationship
than are their children (Bengtson & Kuypers, 1971). Parents
perceive their children as continuations of themselves and
thus perceive more positive feelings in this tie. Children
desire greater independence from parents and are more
invested in enhancing differences. Previous research indicates
that older and middle-aged parents typically report greater

Objectives. Studies of intergenerational relationship quality often include one or two generations. This study exam-
ined within-family differences and similarities or transmission of positive and negative relationship quality across three
generations.
Method. Participants included 633 middle-aged individuals (G2; 52% women, ages 40­60 years), 592 of their
offspring (G3; 53% daughters; ages 18­41 years), and 337 of their parents (i.e., grandparents; G1; 69% women; ages
59­96 years).
Results. Multilevel models revealed differences and similarities in relationship quality across generations. The oldest
generation (G1) reported greater positive and less negative quality relationships than the middle (G2) and the younger
(G3) generations. There was limited evidence of transmission. Middle-aged respondents who reported more positive and
less negative ties with their parents (G1) reported more positive and less negative ties with their own children (G3).
Grandmother (G1) reports of more positive relationship quality were associated with G3 reports of more positive relationship
quality with G2.
Discussion. Findings are consistent with the intergenerational stake hypothesis and only partially consistent with the
theory of intergenerational transmission. Overall, this study suggests that there is greater within-family variability than
similarities in how family members feel about one another.

investment in the tie, greater closeness, and greater positive
relationship quality regarding their children than do their
children (Aquilino, 1999; Shapiro, 2004) and that these
generation differences persist over time (Giarrusso, Feng, &
Benjamin, 2004).
By contrast, researchers examining conflict recognize
that the parent­child relationship often includes tensions
and negative relationship quality (Clarke, Preston, Raksin, &
Bengston, 1999). Negative relationship qualities include the
extent to which parents and children get on one another's
nerves, criticize the other, or make too many demands on
one another. Research indicates that tensions in the rela-
tionship are commonplace (Birditt, Miller, Fingerman, &
Lefkowitz, 2009; Clarke et al., 1999) and that reports vary
by generation. Consistent with the intergenerational stake,
Aquilino (1999) found that young adult children reported
more arguments and tensions with their parents than did
their parents. Similarly, Fingerman (2001) found that adult
daughters reported more conflict and negative feelings with
mothers than did their mothers. This study examined reports
of both positive and negative relationship quality across three
generations. Although it appears that the intergenerational
stake exists within the parent­child tie with regard to how
parents and children feel about one another, it is not clear
whether the stake also exists between ties (G1­G2 vs G2­G3)
in the same family or whether the stake is more prominent
in some family ties than in others.
Intergenerational Transmission of Relationship Quality
Family systems theory suggests that there may be simi-
larities among generations within a family. According to
Bowen (1978), thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are family-
level phenomena in which all family members share a sim-
ilar experience or reality and these experiences are passed
down from older to younger generations (Kerr & Bowen,
1988). Development occurs within, and is influenced by,
the multigenerational family system (Bowen, 1978; Elder,
1981). As a consequence, individuals replicate the early
parent­child relationship with spouses, children, and other
significant relationships (Fingerman & Bermann, 2000).
These theories of transmission typically focus on how specific
parenting behaviors are transmitted across generations. We
extend these theoretical perspectives to examine whether
feelings about one another (i.e., relationship quality) are
transmitted as well. It would stand to reason that how indi-
viduals feel about each other is communicated in some way
(either verbally or behaviorally) and thus transmitted from
one generation to the next. Indeed, research indicates that
emotions are transmitted between family members via emo-
tional contagion in the short term (Almeida, Wethington, &
Chandler, 1999; Larson &Almeida, 1999), emotional reactions
are transmitted from older to younger generations (Patterson,
Bank, & Stoolmiller, 1990), and that subjective well-being
may be transmitted from older to younger generations over
the long term (Powdthavee & Vignoles, 2008). Research
also shows that depression is associated across genera-
tions from G1 and G2 to G3, which may be the result of
emotional transmission as well as other factors including
genetics (Grillon et al., 2005; Warner, Weissman, Mufson,
& Wickramaratne, 1999; Weissman et al., 2005).
The majority of work on intergenerational transmission
of relationship qualities has focused on the transmission of
negative and positive parenting behaviors. Overall, children
exposed to negative parental behaviors (e.g., abusive, harsh,
distant, rejecting) are more likely to behave in kind to their
own children when they grow up (Brook,Whiteman, & Zheng,
2002; Pears & Capaldi, 2001; Straus, Gelles, & Steinmetz,
1980; Whitbeck et al., 1992). Similarly, positive aspects of
the relationship are replicated from one generation to the
next (Belsky, Jaffee, Sligo, Woodward, & Silva, 2005; Chen &
Kaplan, 2001). For example, Belsky and his colleagues
(2005) found that mothers who experienced more positive
parenting engaged in warmer parenting with their own
children. Parenting practices have implications for children
throughout their development. Given the burgeoning literature
regarding the implications of relationship qualities between
adults and their parents for each party's well-being (Fingerman
et al., 2008; Umberson, 1992; Ward, 2008), it is important
to ask whether these qualities also are transmitted across
generations.
Yet, there are no studies to our knowledge that examine
generation differences or intergenerational transmission of
relationship qualities across three generations. In the pre-
sent study, we examined intergenerational differences and
similarities in positive and negative relationship qualities.
Due to the cross-sectional study design, we were not able to
specifically test transmission, but transmission is a possible
explanation for similarities across generations. Researchers
hypothesize that emotions are transmitted via third factors
(e.g., shared environment, personality), directly via empathy,
and indirectly via behavior (Westman & Vinokur, 1998).
Other possible explanations we consider are response sets
and bidirectional associations. For example, middle-aged
individuals may have similar feelings regarding the older
and the younger generations because they have similar feelings
regarding all of their relationships. In addition, two genera-
tions of family members may have similar reports regarding
the middle-aged respondent because of factors associ-
ated with the respondent. Finally, younger generations may
have important influences on the older generations and vice
versa.
Differences in Intergenerational Transmission Between
Grandmothers and Grandfathers
We also considered the possibility that generational
differences and/or transmission vary between G1 grand-
mothers and grandfathers. Indeed, studies show that family
members do not affect one another equally. Some studies
628 BIRDITT ET AL.
RELATIONSHIP QUALITY 3
indicate that mothers have a greater impact on their children
than fathers due to the greater amount of time spent with
their children (Collins & Russel, 1991) and that adult chil-
dren's well-being is more closely tied to the mother tie than
the father tie (Umberson, 1992). Similarly, grandmothers
tend to have more contact and report greater closeness
with grandchildren than do grandfathers (Erber, 2010;
Silverstein & Marenco, 2001). Thus, grandmothers may have
a greater influence on the next generations' relationship
qualities than do grandfathers.
By contrast, in a prior study of intergenerational ties,
qualities of relationships with fathers were more strongly
associated with offspring's well-being than qualities of
relationships with mothers (Fingerman et al., 2008). Chil-
dren also respect their father's opinions more than their
mother's opinions (Thornton, Orbuch, & Axinn, 1995). The
present study assessed whether G1 grandmothers or grand-
fathers had a greater impact on relationship quality of the
G2­G3 relationship; we predicted grandmothers would have
a greater effect than grandfathers.
Of course, we recognize that there are many other factors
that predict relationship quality beyond transmission between
generations. We attempt to control for some of those factors,
and we discuss those in the following sections.
Other Factors Associated With Intergenerational
Relationship Quality
Other factors that may influence parent­child relation-
ship quality include each party's gender, race, marital status,
education,self-ratedhealth,neuroticism,andcontactfrequency
between the parties. Women report more emotionally intense
intergenerational relationships with more positive and more
negative relationship qualities than do men (Fingerman,
2001; Smetana, Daddis & Chuang, 2003). Research and
theory suggest that African Americans report lower quality
intergenerational relationships than European Americans
(Birditt, Rott, & Fingerman, 2009; Connidis & McMullin,
2002).
Individuals who are married or who are better edu-
cated also report better quality parent­child relationships
(Fingerman, Chen, Hay, Cichy, & Lefkowitz, 2006; Pillemer &
Suitor, 2002, 2005; Willson, Shuey, Elder, & Wickrama,
2006). On the other hand, scoring higher in neuroticism,
having lower self-rated health, and reporting more frequent
contact are associated with greater negative quality relations
(Akiyama, Antonucci, Takahashi, & Langfahl, 2003; Birditt,
Rott et al., 2009; Fingerman et al., 2006).
Present Study
The present study seeks to expand our understanding of
intergenerational relationship qualities by examining positive
and negative relationship quality across three generations.
We first examined whether there were differences between
the generations in reports of relationship quality followed
by an examination of similarities across generations. In par-
ticular, we examined whether relationship qualities among
the older generations (G1­G2) predict relationship qualities
among the younger generations (G2­G3). We examined the
effects of the grandmother and grandfather ties separately.
According to the intergenerational stake, we predicted that
the older generations would report greater positive and less
negative quality relationships than the younger generations.
Consistent with family systems theory and intergenerational
transmission research, we expected that greater positive
quality and negative quality in the grandparent (G1) and
middle-aged children (G2) ties would predict greater
positive quality and negative quality in the middle-aged
parent (G2) and young adult children (G3) tie. We pre-
dicted that grandmother ties would have a greater effect
than grandfather ties on the relationship quality of the
younger generations.
Method
Participants
Middle-aged target sample (G2).--Middle-aged target
participants were from the Family Exchanges Study, which
included 633 mothers and fathers aged 40­60 years (302
fathers and 331 mothers from different families) who had at
least one child aged 18 or older and at least one living par-
ent. Middle-aged individuals were randomly selected from
phone lists obtained through Genesys Corporation as
well as random digit dialing in the Philadelphia Primary
Metropolitan Statistical Area (five counties in southeastern
Pennsylvania and four counties in New Jersey) and stratified
by gender and age (40­50 years; 51­60 years; Pennsylvania
State Data Center, 2001). Participants living in Philadelphia
County, high-density minority neighborhoods, and lower
socioeconomic status households were oversampled result-
ing in a total of 37% middle-aged minority participants (31%
AfricanAmerican, 6% multiracial). See Table 1 for the sample
description. Of the potential middle-aged participants con-
tacted, 75% participated and all completed the interviews.
We refer to these participants as the "target" sample because
the additional samples of their children (G3; offspring) and
their parents (G1; grandparents) originated from them, and
all participants reported on their relationships with the target.
See Table 1 for a sample description. A total of 235 targets
had both parents alive (37%), 308 had only mothers alive,
and 90 had only fathers alive. We refer to the G2 target's
parents as G1 or the "grandparent" sample.
Child and grandparent samples (G3 and G1).--Target

information for 791 children, with 592 of the offspring
completing interviews. Offspring ranged in age from 18 to
41 years.
A total of 37% targets (n = 234) had one offspring (G3)
participate, 22% (n = 137) had two offspring participate,
and 4% had three offspring participate. Targets with partici-
pating offspring did not differ from targets without partici-
pating offspring in terms of age, education, self-rated health,
and gender. Offspring who participated were younger, had
better self-rated health, lived closer to parents, were more
likely to co-reside with parents, and were more likely to be
sons than offspring who did not participate. Targets (G2)
reported greater positive and negative quality relationships
with offspring (G3) who participated in the study (mean
[M] = 4.16, standard deviation [SD] = 0.73; M = 2.15, SD =
0.87) compared with offspring not in the study (M = 3.90,
SD = 1.02; M = 1.96, SD = 0.87, t = -5.03, p < .01; t = -3.82,
p < .01).
Of the total number of grandparents alive (N = 864),
respondents provided contact information for 455 of them,
and 337 grandparents completed interviews (234 grand-
mothers, 103 grandfathers). Grandparents ranged in age from
59 to 96 years. A total of 35% of targets (n = 223) had one
grandparent (G1) who participated and 9% (n = 57) had two
grandparents participate. Middle-aged individuals with a
participating grandparent were younger, had better self-
rated health, and were more likely to be women than middle-
aged participants whose grandparents did not participate.
Participating grandparents (G1) were younger and more
likely to be women than nonparticipating grandparents.
Targets reported greater feelings of positive quality regarding
grandfathers and grandmothers who participated (M = 4.16,
SD = 0.70; M = 4.21, SD = 0.66) than grandfathers and

There was no significant variation in negative relationship
quality between G1 participants and nonparticipants.
All families had target participants (G2), and 221 (35%)
families had both G1 and G3 participants; 59 (9%) families
had G1 participants only (no G3), and 178 (28%) families
had G3 participants only (no G1). The remaining 175 fam-
ilies (28%) included only target participants. It is important
to note that the majority of families included reporters
from at least two generations to examine within-family
variations.
Procedure
Participants completed hour-long computer-assisted tele-
phone interviews and received $30 for their time. Midlife
target participants reported their relationship quality with
up to three offspring over age 18 and each of their living
parents (grandparents). Participants with more than three
offspring (12%) reported on the child they provided the
most support to, the child they provided the least support to,
and a randomly selected child. The offspring and grandparents
reported on the relationship quality with the middle-aged
target.
Measures
Relationship quality.--Positive relationship qualities
included two items: "Overall, how much does your (father/
mother/child) love and care for you?" and "How much does
your (father/mother/child) understand you?" Negative qual-
ities included two items: "How much does your (father/
mother/child) criticize you?" and "How much does your
(father/mother/child) make demands on you?" These items
are similar to those used in other studies of the parent­child
tie (Silverstein, Gans, Lowenstein, Giarusso, & Bengtson,
2010; Umberson, 1992). Participants rated the items on a
5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = a great deal). We created
mean scores of positive and negative relationship quality
for the following reports: grandmother regarding target,
grandfather regarding target, target regarding mother, target
regarding father, target reports regarding each adult offspring,
and each adult offspring reports regarding target. The
positive and negative quality scales had moderate inter-
nal consistency (positive  ranged from .40 to .79; negative
 ranged from .37 to .74).Although some of the coefficients
appear low, scales with few items often have lower reliabil-
ity and previous research using similar relationship quality
scales finds similar coefficients (Birditt, Fingerman, & Zarit,
2010; Fingerman et al., 2008). Indeed, coefficient alphas
often underestimate the reliability (Sijtsma, 2009) and they
are influenced by the number of items as well as other fac-
tors (e.g., duplicated items, the number of dimensions in the
scale; Huysamen, 2006).

RELATIONSHIP QUALITY 5
Covariates.--Covariates included gender, marital status,
age, race, education, self-rated health, neuroticism, and contact
frequency (Fingerman et al., 2006). Gender was coded as 0
(women) or 1 (men). Marital status included a dichotomous
score (0 = not married, 1 = married or remarried). We con-
sidered whether to include a more nuanced marital status
variable; however, the categories (e.g., widowed) varied
widely across the generations and thus could not be considered
in the analyses including all generations. Target respondent
race was used for all family members and coded as 0 (not
European American) or 1 (European American). Years of
education included the highest grade or year of college
completed. Participants rated their physical health from 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent). Neuroticism included four items
from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) in
which participants rate how well each of four adjectives
(moody, worrying, nervous, and calm) described them-
selves: 1 (not all) to 5 (a lot). Calm was reverse coded, and
all items were averaged so that higher scores represent
greater neuroticism. The scale had moderate internal
consistency ( = 0.66, 0.73, and 0.65 among offspring,
middle-aged targets, and grandparents, respectively). Con-
tact frequency included "In the past 12 months how often
have you seen (father/mother/child) in person?" being rated
as 1 (less than once a year or never), 2 (once a year), 3
(a few times a year), 4 (monthly), 5 (a few times a month), 6
(weekly), 7 (a few times a week), or 8 (daily). It is important
to note that the contact frequency did not include phone or
other types of contact (e.g., email, texts), which may be a
limitation.
Analysis strategy.--First, we calculated correlations among
the study variables and among the family member reports of
relationship quality. Next, because the data included multi-
ple reports from individuals within the same family, we
used multilevel modeling to address the issue of depen-
dencies in the data (SAS PROC MIXED; Singer, 1998).
These models account for the nested or clustered nature of
the data.
We first examined the intergenerational stake hypothesis
by assessing generational differences in reports of relation-
ship quality. We estimated two multilevel models assessing
differences in positive quality and negative quality. The models
included two random effects that allowed for correlated
errors within families and within generation. The outcomes
were positive and negative relationship quality, and the pre-
dictor was family member. Family member was a combina-
tion of generation and gender and coded as 1 = grandmother
(G1) re: target (G2); 2 = grandfather (G1) re: target (G2);
3 = target (G2) re: grandmother (G1); 4 = target (G2)
re: grandfather (G1); 5 = target (G2) re: offspring (G3);
6 = offspring (G3) re: target (G2). Covariates included
gender, race, marital status, education, self-rated health,
neuroticism, and contact frequency. We did not include age
as a covariate due to the high correlation between age and
generation (r = .83) and the possible problems with multi-
collinearity. To examine differences between family mem-
bers, we examined all pairwise comparisons of means with
Tukey adjustments.
Next, we used multilevel models to examine whether
relationship qualities are transmitted from the grandmother
and grandfather relationships with middle-aged target
(G1­G2) to the target­offspring relationship (G2-G3). The
outcomes included "middle-aged target" and "offspring
reports" of positive and negative relationship quality, and
these outcomes were assessed in separate models. The
models included one random effect for family. The models
examined the grandmother­target relationship and the
grandfather­target relationship as separate predictors, and
the models were estimated in two steps as follows: (a) target
reports of grandmother or grandfather (G1) as predictors,
(b) grandmother or grandfather reports (G1) regarding
target (G2) as predictors. Models predicting target reports
controlled for target reports of age, gender, race, marital
status, education, self-rated health, neuroticism, and contact
frequency.
Similar models were used to examine offspring reports
regarding targets. The models were estimated using the same
two steps. The models controlled for race, and offspring's
gender, age, marital status, education, self-rated health,
neuroticism, and contact frequency. Models also controlled
for the target reports of relationship quality regarding off-
spring because we were interested in effects of the older
generations on the offspring beyond the perceptions of the
target.
There were less than 1% missing data with regard to
covariates and relationship quality. Multilevel models are
ideal because families with missing data are not removed
from the analyses, and the models are not affected by
unbalanced data (i.e., in which some families include
more member reports than others).
Results
Description of the Data
Correlation analyses revealed that positive and negative
quality were negatively correlated (r = -.20, p < .01). Indi-
viduals who had more education, scored lower on neuroti-
cism, who were men, who were European American, and
who reported more frequent contact also reported more
positive relationship quality. Individuals who were younger,
who scored higher on neuroticism, who were women, who
were unmarried, and who reported more frequent contact
reported greater negative relationship quality.
Correlations between family members' reports of rela-
tionship quality revealed that target (G2) reports of grand-
mother and grandfather (G1) were moderately correlated
(r = .21 for positive and .07 for negative). Grandmothers'
and grandfathers' ratings of target (G2) were not highly

correlated (r = .11 for positive and -.03 for negative). Target
(G2) and grandmother (G1) reports were moderately corre-
lated (r = .29 for positive and .32 for negative). Target and
grandfather reports were low to moderately correlated as
well (r = .08 for positive, and .20 for negative). Target (G2)
and offspring (G3) reports of one another were moderately
correlated (r = .34 for positive and .25 for negative).
Grandmother and grandfather reports had low to mod-
erate correlations with target reports of offspring (grand-
mother [positive r = -.08; negative r = .11]; grandfather
[positive r = -.07; negative r = .12]) and offspring reports of
target (grandmother [positive r = .13; negative r = .02];
grandfather [positive r = .01; negative r = .18]).
Variations Among Generations in Relationship Quality
Our first research question pertained to the intergenera-
tional stake and whether parents in either G1 or G2 genera-
tion reported more positive relationship qualities and less

negative relationship quality than did their children. Multilevel
models revealed that positive relationship quality varied
among family members (F(5, 1592) = 16.66, p < .01; Table 2).
As predicted, the oldest G1 generation reported greater
positive quality than the middle (G2) and youngest (G3)
generations. In particular, grandparents (G1) reported greater
positive relationship quality with targets (G2) than targets
reported about grandparents (G1). There was no significant
difference between target reports of positive relationship
quality with their offspring (G3) and their offspring reports
(G3) of positive relationship quality with them.
Negative relationship quality also varied among family
members (F(5, 1594) = 19.19, p < .01; Table 2). As predicted,
the oldest generation tended to report the lowest negative
relationship quality followed by middle-aged targets and
their offspring. In particular, (G1) grandmothers reported
significantly lower negative relationship quality than (G2)
middle-aged targets about grandmothers. Significant differ-
ences in relationship qualities were not found for grandfa-
thers and middle-aged targets.
Generational differences in negative relationship qualities
also were evident for (G2) targets and (G3) their children.
Middle-aged targets reported lower negative relationship
quality regarding offspring than offspring reported about
them.
Intergenerational Transmission of Relationship Quality
We then examined whether the relationship quality in the
G1­G2 relationship predicted relationship quality in the
G2­G3 relationship. First, we examined the predictors of tar-
get (G2) reports regarding their offspring (G3; see Table 3).
632 BIRDITT ET AL.
RELATIONSHIP QUALITY 7
As predicted, targets (G2) who reported greater positive
relations with their mother and father (i.e., G1 grandmother
and grandfather) reported more positive relationships with
their own children (G3). When grandparent (G1) reports
were added in the next step, the models revealed that higher
grandmother (G1) reports of positive quality regarding targets
(G2) were associated with lower target (G2) reports of positive
relationship quality regarding their own children (G3).
The models predicting target (G2) reports of negative
relationship quality regarding offspring (G3) revealed that,
as hypothesized, middle-aged targets who reported greater
negative relationships with their mothers and fathers (i.e.,
G1 grandmothers and grandfathers) reported more negative
relationships with their own children (G3; Table 3). Grand-
parent (G1) reports of negative relationship quality were
not associated with target reports (G2) regarding their
offspring (G3).
The next set of models examined whether the G1­G2
relationship predicted the G2­G3 relationship as reported
by the G3 participants (Table 4). The models examining posi-
tive relationship quality revealed that there were no main
effects of target reports (G2) regarding grandparents on off-
spring reports (G3). The models that included grandparent
reports revealed that grandmothers (G1) who reported
greater positive relationship quality with their children
(i.e., G2 targets) had grandchildren (G3) who reported
more positive relationships with their middle-aged parents
(i.e., G2 targets).
The models examining negative relationship quality
revealed that there were no significant associations between
target reports regarding grandparents or grandparent reports
and the offspring reports.
Post hoc tests
Because the models examining the grandparent (G1)
reports as predictors of G2­G3 relationship quality may have
been affected by the inclusion of target (G2) reports, we rees-
timated the models with only grandparents (G1) as the predic-
tors(alongwithcovariates)andfoundnoassociationsbetween
grandparent (G1) reports and either target (G2) reports of
children (G3) or children's (G3) reports of targets (G2).
We were also intrigued by the negative association be-
tween grandmother (G1) reports of positive relationship
quality and target (G2) reports of positive relationship
quality. The negative coefficient may imply that positive
G2­G3 relationship quality is lower when G1 reports
greater relationship quality than G2 (i.e., greater intergener-
ational stake). We explored this issue further by estimating
additional multilevel models examining the difference be-
tween G1 and G2 reports (G1 - G2) as predictors of target
(G2) reports and offspring (G3) reports. For positive quality,
the difference score for grandmother and grandfather (G1)
reports of positive relationship quality regarding target (G2)
and middle-aged target (G2) reports regarding their parents
(G1) was negatively associated with targets' (G2) reports of
relationship quality regarding their children (G3; b = -.24,
standard error [SE] = .06, p < .01; b = -.22, SE = .08, p <
.01, respectively). This finding implies that the greater the
difference between G1 and G2 reports (with G1 reporting

greater positivity) the lower the quality of G2's relationship
with their own children. There were no significant associa-
tions between the difference scores and offspring reports of
positive quality.
For negative quality, there was a significant negative as-
sociation (b = -.14, SE = .07, p < .05) between the differ-
ence score for grandfather reports (G1) and target reports
(G2) predicting target reports of negative relationship
quality regarding their own children(G3). This negative as-
sociation implies that the larger the discrepancy between
reports (with G1 reporting more negativity than G2) the
lower the negativity in the G2­G3 relationship. There was
no significant association between difference scores and
offspring reports of negative relationship quality. Overall,
these findings suggest that the developmental stake in the
G1­G2 relationship predicts poorer relationship quality in
the G2­G3 relationship.
Research indicates that the parent­child tie varies
depending on whether adult children are living at home
(Aquilino, 1991; Aquilino & Supple, 1991; Pillemer &
Suitor, 1991). Sixty-five percent of targets had a least one
adult child live at home in the past year. We conducted all
analyses again controlling for coresidence of target with at
least one adult offspring, and the findings were the same.
Too few aging parents (G1) coresided with targets (G2) to
conduct the analyses controlling for coresidence between
the older generations.
Finally, research indicates that the parent­child tie var-
ies depending on whether parents are divorced, remarried,
widowed, or married (Aquilino, 1994; Booth & Amato,
1994; Kaufman & Uhlenberg, 1998; Rossi & Rossi, 1990;
Umberson, 1992). We conducted all analyses again controlling
for a four-category target marital status variable. The differ-
ences among family members in reports of relationship
quality were similar after controlling for marital status. Two
important exceptions were that negative relationship quality
no longer varied between the G2 and G3 reports of one
another and target reports regarding their children no longer
varied by positive grandmother reports. Thus, it appears that
marital status accounts for some of the variations and asso-
ciations in relationship quality in the G2­G3 relationship.
However, the results regarding marital status should be
interpreted with caution, given the small number of target
individuals who were widowed (2.2%) or remarried (7.1%).
Discussion
This study reveals the complexity of family relationships
across three generations. Unlike previous studies, which
have often included two generations of families, this study
examined positive and negative dimensions of relationship
quality within families across three generations. Overall,
this study suggests that there is greater within-family vari-
ability than similarities in relationship quality. Findings are
consistent with the intergenerational stake hypothesis and
only partially consistent with the theory of intergenerational
transmission.
Generational Differences and the Intergenerational Stake
Positive and negative quality varied across the three gen-
erations. Consistent with the intergenerational stake and
previous research, grandparents reported higher positive
quality than the middle-aged targets regarding grandpar-
ents. Interestingly, and extending the previous research, this
study found no generation difference in reports of positive
quality among the middle-aged targets and their offspring.
The intergenerational stake may increase as parents and
children grow older (Bengtson & Kuypers, 1971; Shapiro,
2004). Older adults may experience greater investment in
the relationship with their middle-aged offspring when their
middle-aged offspring have the least time to invest in the tie.
Older adults, for example, have more time due to retirement
and may need help due to health declines whereas middle-aged
adults often have several demanding roles (e.g., children,
spouses, and work) causing lower positive quality among
middle-aged children regarding their parents (Birditt, Miller
et al., 2009).
As predicted and also consistent with the intergenera-
tional stake, the older generation members in families reported
lower levels of negative relationship quality than the younger
generations. In particular, grandmothers reported lower
negative quality than middle-aged targets reported regarding
grandmothers. In addition, middle-aged targets reported
lower negative quality regarding their offspring than their
offspring reported regarding the relationship. The genera-
tion differences show evidence of the stake in the older
(G1­G2) and younger (G2­G3) generation relationships in
which parents report lower negative relationship quality
than children. These findings contribute to the previous
work by moving beyond the parent­child dyad and showing
that the intergenerational stake exists with regard to negative
relationship qualities across three generations (Aquilino,
1999; Fingerman, 2001). Interestingly, these findings show
evidence of the stake between grandmothers and their
middle-aged offspring and not grandfathers and their
offspring, which may be due to mother's greater contact and
closeness with children than fathers (Rossi & Rossi, 1990).
Of course, because the data are cross-sectional, it is not
clear what factors explain the variations in relationship
quality by generation. The generation differences may not
be due to relationship dynamics as suggested by the inter-
generational stake hypothesis. For example, age-related
improvements in emotion regulation and less attention
and memory for negative information (Carstensen, 2006;
Labouvie-Vief, 2003) may lead grandparents to report
better quality parent­child relationships than middle-aged
adults and their offspring. It is also possible that cohort
differences contribute to how people appraise intergenerational
relationships. Older generations may feel less comfortable

expressing negative feelings about family relationships than
younger generations due to experiences specific to their
cohort such as the Great Depression.
In addition, there is some selection bias in the reports of
relationship quality as individuals with more positive rela-
tionships are more likely to participate. However, partici-
pating and nonparticipating grandparents did not vary in
negative relationship quality, and children who participated
were rated as more negative than nonparticipating children.
Thus, the findings do appear to reveal actual variations
between generations in reports that are not completely an
artifact of who chooses to participate.
Transmission of Relationship Quality Across Generations
According to family systems theory, people reenact patterns
of behaviors they learned as children in their relationships
with spouses, children, and others (Bowen, 1978). We
extended this theory to the concept of relationship quality
and hypothesized that families would transmit feelings
of positive and negative relationship quality from older
to younger generations. The present study revealed limited
evidence of transmission. Middle-aged individuals who
reported better quality relationships with their mothers and
fathers (i.e., G1 grandparents) reported better quality rela-
tionships with their own children (G3). The more stringent
test of transmission involved the models examining grand-
parent reports as predictors, and we found few transmission
effects when examining grandparent reports. This study
revealed an association between grandmother positivity and
the younger generations but no grandfather effects and no
transmission effects for negative quality.
The associations between middle-aged respondent
reports of their parents and children may be due to trans-
mission, but we cannot rule out other competing explana-
tions. One obvious consideration is that factors associated
with the target (i.e., targets report similar relationship
quality in all their relationships) might account for simi-
larities in relationship quality of middle-aged adults with
grandparents and offspring. We did control for target
factors including personality, but we may not have been
able to rule out other explanations for similar relationship
quality.
Grandmother reports of positive relationship quality with
their middle-aged children seemingly had dual effects.
Grandmothers' higher ratings of positive relationship quality
with their middle-aged children were associated with lower
feelings of positivity among middle-aged targets regarding
their offspring but greater offspring reports of positivity
regarding the middle-aged parents. Thus, it appears that
grandmother feelings of positivity regarding their own
children may be transmitted to their grandchildren. This is
consistent with research indicating that positive parenting
practices (e.g., warm parenting) are replicated from one
generation to the next (Belsky et al., 2005; Chen & Kaplan,
2001). The negative association between positive grandmother
reports and middle-aged target reports was surprising. It is
possible that middle-aged respondents experience more
burden from close and positive relationships with their
mothers than do their offspring. Indeed, middle-aged adults
are often relied on for support and provide care to multiple
generations of family members and often provide more than
they receive (Fingerman et al., 2011; Levitt, Guacci, &
Weber, 1992).
Interestingly, we also found evidence that the intergener-
ational stake in the G1­G2 relationship may have negative
implications for the G2­G3 relationship. Greater intergen-
erational differences in the G1­G2 tie with G1 reporting
greater positive quality and lower negative quality than G2
predicted lower relationship quality in the G2­G3 relation-
ship (as reported by G2). A larger intergenerational stake
may indicate that there is greater disagreement in the rela-
tionship, which may spill over into the G2­G3 relationship.
The stake may also indicate that G1 are more demanding on
G2, which may strain their relationships with their own
children (G3). Indeed, Fingerman (2001) found that middle-
aged daughters reported their mothers were intrusive and
demanding when mothers rated the relationship as more
important.
Thus, with regards to transmission, we found only par-
tial evidence. These findings indicate that there is greater
variation between generations in relationship quality
than there are similarities. However, before abandoning
the idea of intergenerational transmission of relationship
quality, it is important to recognize that limitations in the
study design may have prevented us from finding more
evidence of transmission. For example, the grandparents
who participated had more positive relationships with
targets than those who did not participate. There may be
more transmission in families with lower positive quality
ties. There were fewer grandfathers who participated
than grandmothers, which may have reduced the likeli-
hood of finding transmission effects for grandfathers. In
addition, this study included only one set of grandpar-
ents, and the transmission effects may occur with the
nontarget parents.
This study also showed that intergenerational relation-
ship quality is associated with other important personality
and demographic factors. Greater neuroticism was associ-
ated with lower quality intergenerational relationships,
which is consistent with previous research (Fingerman
et al., 2006). Furthermore, women and individuals who had
more contact reported greater positive and greater negative
quality relationships (Akiyama et al., 2003; Fingerman,
2001). There were also findings that were not consistent
across positive and negative relationship quality. Individ-
uals with greater education and European American indi-
viduals reported greater positive relationship quality, which
is consistent with previous research (Birditt, Rott et al.,
2009). Similar to previous research, individuals who were

younger and individuals who were unmarried reported
greater negative relationship quality (Birditt et al., 2010;
Birditt, Jackey, & Antonucci, 2009).
Limitations and Future Directions
There are several limitations to the present study that
provide directions for future research. Most importantly,
because of the cross-sectional nature of the design, we
cannot be sure of the stability or developmental nature of
the effects. A longitudinal study is needed to examine gen-
eration differences and similarities over time. Furthermore,
families in this study may not include particularly troubled
parent­child relationships or families. We may have found
more similarities across family member reports of relation-
ship quality in more troublesome or abusive families. It is
important to note, however, that participating children
were rated as more negative than nonparticipating chil-
dren, and there were no variations in negative relationship
quality between participating grandparents and nonpartic-
ipating grandparents. Another consideration is that we did
not include retrospective assessments of early childhood
experiences. Although colored by current feelings, these
retrospective reports may nonetheless provide some in-
sight about long-term relationship dynamics. We also
know little about the mechanisms that account for varia-
tions between family members or links among family
members' perceptions of relationship quality. Future studies
should consider dynamics between parents and children
over time and examine how parents and children commu-
nicate their feelings toward one another. Finally, partici-
pants were asked to report on up to three children.Although
the sample of adults who had more than three children was
small (12%), we recognize that parents may have different
quality relationships with those children who were not
assessed.
Overall, this study shows that there is substantial
within-family variation in relationship quality and that
generation plays an important role in those variations.
Indeed, generation differences appear to vary depending
on the developmental stages of the parents and children.
We found only partial evidence that intergenerational
relationship quality may be transmitted from older to
younger generations of families. We hope that this
research encourages additional studies on multiple gen-
erations and relationship quality. These patterns of rela-
tionship quality most likely have implications for the
health and well-being of the individual family members
as well as the overall well-being and functioning of entire
families.
