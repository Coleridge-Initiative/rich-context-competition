Research question
This paper examines whether monetary policy changes in major advanced economies
(US, UK, and the euro area) are transmitted through the credit extension of banks in
Austria and Germany. In particular, the role of banks' funding structure, broken down
by country of origin as well as by currency denomination, for the international
transmission of monetary policy changes to bank lending is compared.
This paper is a contribution to the IBRN (International Banking Research Network)1
project on "The International Transmission of Monetary Policy".
Contribution
Against the background of current monetary policy and the relevance of internationally
active banks, a growing literature has been exploring the international transmission of
monetary policy. Existing studies find that bank characteristics, for instance the
geographical funding structure, play an important role for the international transmission
of monetary policy. At the same time, other studies show that internationally active
banks transfer funds internationally to capitalise on favourable foreign funding
conditions. Our study compares the role of the geographical and the currency funding
structure for the international transmission of monetary policy changes to the credit
extension by banks in Austria and Germany.
Results
In our study on banks in Austria and Germany (sample period: 2005-2015) we find only
weak evidence for the international transmission of monetary policy through the bank
funding channel. Empirical results for the inward transmission appear to indicate that
US monetary policy might affect domestic lending to the non-financial private sector
the more a bank funds its operations in US dollars (but not from the US). This effect is
more pronounced in Germany than in Austria. However, although statistically
significant, the economic impact is negligible. For direct cross-border credit extension
of banks in Austria and Germany we do not find a robust impact of funding structures.

Beitrag
Vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen Geldpolitik sowie der Relevanz international tätiger
Banken untersucht eine wachsende Zahl von Studien die internationale geldpolitische
Transmission. Die Studien zeigen, dass bankspezifische Eigenschaften, beispielsweise
die geographische Refinanzierungsstruktur, dabei eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Es wird
auch gezeigt, dass international tätige Banken ihre Konzernstruktur einsetzen, um
ausländische Refinanzierungsvorteile zu nutzen. Unsere Arbeit untersucht, inwieweit
die Refinanzierungsstruktur der Banken in Österreich und Deutschland deren
Kreditvergabe an den heimischen und ausländischen Privatsektor beeinflusst.
Ergebnisse
In unserer Studie für in Österreich und Deutschland ansässigen Banken (Zeitraum:
2005-2015) finden wir nur wenige empirische Belege dafür, dass die
Refinanzierungsstruktur eine maßgebliche Determinante für die internationale
geldpolitische Transmission darstellt. Die empirischen Ergebnisse für die Transmission
ausländischer Geldpolitiken auf die inländische Kreditvergabe zeigen einen Einfluss
besonders für diejenigen Banken, die sich stark in US Dollar (nicht jedoch in den USA)
refinanzieren. Dieser Zusammenhang ist in Deutschland ausgeprägter als in Österreich,
wobei dieser Effekt zwar statisch signifikant, ökonomisch aber unbedeutend ist. Für die
grenzüberschreitende Kreditvergabe von Banken in Österreich und Deutschland lässt
sich kein robuster Einfluss bestimmter Refinanzierungsstrukturen feststellen.

Abstract
In this paper, we examine the international transmission of monetary policies of major advanced
economies (US, UK, euro area) through banks in Austria and Germany. In particular, we
compare the role of banks' funding structure, broken down by country of origin as well as by
currency denomination, in the international transmission of monetary policy changes to bank
lending. We find weak evidence for inward spillovers. The more a bank is funded in US dollars,
the more its domestic real sector lending is affected by monetary policy changes in the US. This
effect is more pronounced in Germany than in Austria. We do not find evidence for outward
spillovers of euro area monetary policy through a bank funding channel.
Keywords: monetary policy spillover, global banks, bank funding channel.

1 Introduction
After the global financial crisis, the monetary policy rates of major advanced economies
were slashed to unprecedented low levels. To provide additional monetary stimulus,
their central banks substantially increased their balance sheets. At the same time, the
relevance of internationally active banks and global banking networks for the
international transmission of shocks affecting credit extension in other countries has
become apparent (see e.g. Hale et al. 2016, Puri et al. 2011). Against this background, a
renewed interest in the (international) transmission of monetary policies has emerged
(e.g. Hofmann and Takáts 2015, Bruno and Shin 2015, Cetorelli and Goldberg 2012,
Fratzscher et al. 2016, Chen et al. 2016). In this paper, we analyze the funding structure
of banks in Austria (AT) and Germany (DE) and examine how changes in the monetary
policy of major reserve currency countries affect bank lending dependent on the funding
structure of these banks.
The Austrian and German financial systems are predominantly bank-based, and both
countries are home to several large international banks with significant exposures and
liabilities abroad.4 Some of these internationally active banks receive a considerable
share of funding from abroad and in foreign currency, and provide both foreign
currency and euro-denominated credit to international borrowers. As to bank funding,
we show that it makes a difference whether it is disaggregated by the country where it is
from, or by the currency it is denominated in. While the major foreign funding currency
is the US dollar, the country where most of banks' external funding is rooted is the UK,
with London being the banking hub for Europe. Then, in our analyses, we test for the
existence of an international bank funding channel5 by considering the heterogeneity in
banks' funding structure. In particular, we study whether banks with strong funding
roots in a country or a currency adjust their credit extension following a change in the
monetary policy stance in that country. We study this transmission from both an inward
and an outward perspective. While the former looks at how changes in the monetary
policies of the US and the UK6 impact domestic lending of resident banks, the latter
4 Although international banks represent a substantial share of both the Austrian and German banking
systems, the major market share in lending is held by - primarily locally active - cooperative and savings
banks.
5 Through the bank funding channel, cheaper (more expensive) funding is translated into higher (lower)
credit extension.
6 We look at the US and the UK as they represent the main financial partners of the Austrian and German
banking systems.
2
looks at how changes in domestic monetary policy (the euro area) affect these banks'
cross-border lending.7
While during `normal' times central banks steer monetary policy rates by setting
interest rates and providing scarce liquidity to banks, this has changed since the global
financial crisis, when all major central banks started conducting some form of
quantitative easing. Funding constraints of banks have been lifted by converting banks'
illiquid assets into liquid central bank reserves. As a result, when central banks operate
within an environment of excess liquidity the bank funding pattern is likely to be less
important for the international transmission of monetary policy changes. Therefore, we
examine whether monetary policy spillovers are attenuated when banks are flush with
central bank reserves.
Our results provide only weak evidence for the transmission of monetary policy through
the international bank funding channel. Inward transmission estimation results appear to
indicate that US monetary policy might affect domestic lending to the non-financial
private sector the more a bank funds its operations in US dollars, the major foreign
funding currency in Germany. However, the economic impact is negligibly small.
Overall Austrian banks rely less heavily on non-euro (area) foreign funding; hence it is
not surprising that we observe less foreign monetary policy spillovers through this
channel. We do not find evidence for outward spillovers of euro area monetary policy,
although the major share of funding stems from the euro area and is denominated in
euro. Overall, the statistically significant results are not very robust to changes in
specifications and alternative measures of monetary policy. Hence, we conclude that
currently bank funding structures do not play a major role for the international
transmission of monetary policy through the Austrian and German banking system.
In the geographical dimension, our work most closely adds to the literature providing
evidence for the international transmission of US monetary policy (e.g. Morais et al.
2018, Correa and Murry 2010). These studies, looking more closely at bank
characteristics, find that geographical funding structure plays an important role for the
international transmission of US monetary policy. For instance, Cetorelli and Goldberg
(2012) and Braeuning and Ivashina (2017) show that when US monetary policy
tightens, global banks use fund transfers from their foreign offices to capitalise on
favourable foreign funding conditions. Avdjiev and Takáts (2016) show more generally
that the currency composition of cross-border bank claims has a significant impact on
7 A tightening of monetary policy could lead to an appreciation of the respective currency and, as a
consequence, funding costs for those banks that hold liabilities in this currency would increase even
further, with potential additional implications for credit supply. In our analyses, we are not able to
account for this exchange rate effect and we may underestimate the change in funding costs for banks.

the size, distribution and direction of cross-border monetary policy spillovers since
2012. However, no study has yet compared the country and the currency dimension of
bank funding and its relevance for monetary policy transmission.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we describe the data
we use and provide some stylized facts. Section 3 outlines the empirical approach, and
in Section 4 we present and discuss our results and some robustness checks. Section 5
concludes.
2 Data and stylized facts
2.1 Data
We use confidential bank-level data collected by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank
(OeNB) and the Deutsche Bundesbank. The dataset comprises unconsolidated domestic
exposures of banks located in Austria and Germany (including foreign-owned banks) as
well as information on all of these banks' direct cross-border lending and funding
positions by country and by currency. Data frequency is quarterly, and our sample
period lasts from 2005Q1 to 2015Q4.8 As we are looking at the international
transmission of monetary policy, our sample is confined to major internationally active
banks. We exclude special-purpose banks such as home loan banks, auto banks,
investment banks or development banks.9 Balance sheet positions of banks merged with
another bank during the observation period are aggregated and treated as one bank.10
We drop observations with changes in lending to the non-financial private sector (our
main dependent variable) that are equal to or greater than 100 percent in absolute terms.
Bank-specific controls include the core deposits ratio, capital ratio, net intragroup
funding ratio and log of total assets.11 Appendix 1 provides an overview of variable
definitions and Appendix 2 shows some summary statistics for AT and DE,
respectively.
8 Due to data constraints the sample period starts in 2005Q2 in AT.
9 We also exclude banks showing structural breaks such as the selling of business units that leads to high
volatility in the data.
10 This approach of backward aggregation has been widely used in the literature. See, for example,
Gambacorta and Shin (2016), Ehrmann et al. (2003), Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004) and De Haas et al.
(2015).
11 To examine the role of net cross-border intragroup funding, we require data on lending between the
parent bank in the home country and its affiliates abroad. As these data are not readily available, we
proxy intragroup funding by relying on the affiliates' positions vis-ŕ-vis the home banking system. For a
similar approach, see Frey and Kerl (2015). A major limitation is that this proxy is available for domestic
but not for foreign banks. For Austria net intragroup funding excludes positions of foreign subsidiaries
located outside of Austria, but includes positions of respective foreign branches.
4
Our main monetary policy measure is the change in the money market rate of those
countries and currencies that are of the greatest relevance to Austrian and German banks
(i.e. US, UK, euro area). The money market rate represents the most general indicator of
the monetary policy stance irrespective of the liquidity situation in which the central
bank operates.12 However, since the financial crisis, if not beforehand, the central banks
of the major advanced economies have been operating at the zero lower bound. At the
zero lower bound, central banks also have eased funding constraints of banks by
providing excess central bank liquidity via outright purchases of longer term assets. In
such an environment, the money market rate fails to signal a loosening of the monetary
policy stance as the impact of these purchases is primarily reflected in long term interest
rates. As the bank funding channel might be less relevant in an environment of abundant
liquidity, particularly for banks holding a large amount of reserves, we use the banks'
ratio of cash and central bank reserves over total assets (liquidity ratio) as an additional
interaction variable to test for a conditional effect in the general transmission
mechanism.13

AT DE

12 In the UK, the US and the euro area, the central bank steers the interbank rate by setting main policy
rates and providing liquidity according to the banking system's needs. The correlation between the main
policy rate and the interbank rate is high. In recent years, however, those central banks have taken
measures that increased excess liquidity. As a consequence, the relevant policy rate has changed from an
interest rate at which the central bank provides liquidity to the interest rate at the lower bound of the
corridor (deposit rate). The money market rate accounts for this shift and therefore serves as a suitable
proxy of the `true' policy rate.
13 If banks decide to invest in low remunerated excess liquidity at the central bank opportunities to
provide credit to the NFP at attractive interest rates seem to be low. With a subdued credit demand
funding constraints are not a relevant factor to explain changes in the supply of credit.
5
Figure 1 shows the increase in the liquidity ratio at the level of the banking system and
individual banks. While in AT the degree of excess liquidity increased only modestly
(and is generally much smaller in scale than for DE banks), in DE there is a significant
increase in the amount of liquidity on banks' balance sheets since the money market rate
has approached the zero lower bound.
2.2 Stylised facts
The Austrian and German banking systems are internationally integrated. The majority
of foreign activities, however, are concentrated in a limited number of global banks. We
restrict our analyses to these internationally active banks representing roughly 70
percent of total banking system assets for AT and 50 percent of total banking system
assets for DE. Internationally active banks are principally all banks that have cross-
border exposures or liabilities and therefore report the external banking statistics of AT
or DE.14 On aggregate, in both countries the share of foreign loans in total assets is
higher than the share of external liabilities in total liabilities (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: International integration of the Austrian and German international
banks
AT DE

14 We further limit the sample to banks where lending to the private sector is a substantial line of
business. We obtained information on this from the banks' websites.
6
In the inward regressions the dependent variable is domestic lending to the non-
financial private sector (NFPS). The banks in our sample provide in AT almost 60
percent and in DE almost 50 percent of all domestic outstanding lending to the NFPS.
On the funding side, we observe that a major share of external liabilities comes from the
euro area and is denominated in euro (see Figure 3).
Figure 3: Split of external liabilities according to countries and to currencies (as of
end 2015)
AT DE
Source: OeNB, Bundesbank, authors' calculations.
Beyond that, the largest shares of external liabilities are from the US, the UK, CH and
JP. Together these four countries, however, only account for less than 55 percent of
total external liabilities for DE and only 15 percent for AT. The shares of these
countries' currencies are somewhat higher in AT and amount to a total of about 30
percent but only to about 35 percent in DE. For AT a substantial part of EUR external
liabilities comes from deposits by non-euro area countries located predominantly in
Eastern Europe. As Switzerland and Japan ­ both geographically and in terms of
currency ­ are of less importance in the share of foreign funding, we focus on US and
UK monetary policies.
Interestingly, while geographically the most important foreign country is the UK,
followed by the US, the order is reversed when looking at the currency shares of
funding in GBP and USD. Therefore, we deem it worthwhile to look more deeply into
the role of the country and the currency dimension of banks' liabilities as a transmission
channel of monetary policy changes. Spillover effects might differ due to various
7
frictions in the respective markets. For instance, exchange rate changes affect net
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and hence potentially impact banks'
lending capacity.
The euro area and the EUR represent the most important source and currency of bank
funding in AT and DE. For AT the shares of funding from the euro area or in euro are
around 90 percent of total liabilities and for DE close to 80 percent (Figure 4). In
addition, the share of external loans in total assets is sizable and even larger than the
share of external funding relative to total liabilities (Figure 2). Thus, from this
observation we expect that the economic importance of an international bank funding
channel is likely to be more pronounced with respect to the outward transmission of
euro area monetary policy to Austrian and German banks' external lending.
Figure 4: Total liabilities from the euro area or denominated in euro (as of end-
2015)

International banks from AT and DE lend to more than 100 recipient countries each ­
directly across borders or via affiliates located abroad. In the analysis of outward
spillovers we are going to exploit this notable heterogeneity in the cross-section and
time dimension for direct cross-border positions.15 To reduce noise, however, we
15 For AT the available unconsolidated data representing direct cross-border positions (used for the
estimations in this paper) only cover around 25% of the consolidated outward positions (which includes
foreign subsidiaries' local positions). Unfortunately the detailed split by currency and region on the
liability side is not available for the consolidated view. Therefore we focus on cross-border lending.
8
restrict our outward sample to the most important recipient countries in terms of real
sector lending (see section 4.2).
3 Empirical approach
In our analyses, the identification of the effect of monetary policy changes on banks'
lending stems from the heterogeneity across banks in their reliance on short term
funding. We hypothesize that banks that rely more on funding from a certain country or
in a certain currency are affected more strongly by changes in the respective monetary
policy than other banks and, hence, adjust their lending more. Yet this international
bank funding channel of monetary policy might also be subdued in an environment of
excess liquidity. Banks that are holding excess central bank reserves are reluctant to
lend or might lack lending opportunities but they are presumably not funding
constrained. To address this issue econometrically, we apply, in a second step, a triple
interaction of the changes in the money market rate, the bank-specific funding variable
and the bank-specific liquidity ratio.
3.1 Inward transmission
To explore whether foreign monetary policy changes affect domestic lending of resident
banks through the bank funding channel, in a first step we estimate the following
baseline regression:
(1)  ,

,
  
,

,

,

+ + + ,
The dependent variable  is the log change of domestic lending to the private non-
financial sector. Subscript b denotes banks and t time periods (quarters) while
superscript c refers to either countries {US, UK} or to currencies {USD, GBP} which
represent the core financial partners and currencies for Austrian and German banks.

ensure that these variables do not reflect the changes in monetary policy.
is a vector of the following five bank control variables which might be relevant for
the change in lending. Except for the proxy for bank size, all bank characteristics are
expressed relative to total assets (see Appendix 1). The log of total assets (bank size)
and net intragroup funding reflect potentially preferential access to external funding and
ex-ante reliance on internal capital markets. The core deposits ratio captures the extent
to which banks access alternative sources of funding outside wholesale funding. The
capital ratio accounts for capital constraints that may impair the adjustment of banks'
loan supply in response to a monetary policy shock. The liquidity ratio, defined as
banks' excess reserves held at the central bank plus cash, approximates the dependence
on short-term funding. and are quarter and bank fixed effects. Standard errors ,
are clustered at the bank level.
We are interested in coefficient estimate . A negative and significant coefficient
would provide evidence for inward spillovers of monetary policy changes through an
international bank funding channel related to countries or currencies c to Austrian and
German debtors.
To examine whether this international monetary policy transmission is hampered in the
context of surplus liquidity, in a second step we extend the baseline regression by a
triple interaction of the monetary policy variable, the transmission channel and the
liquidity ratio.

,
is the bank-specific liquidity ratio. Banks with high amounts of excess liquidity
can assumed to be overfunded and therefore the importance of the bank funding channel
for the respective bank might be less apparent.17
We are interested in particular in coefficient as this shows us the effect of foreign
monetary policy changes conditional on the bank-specific endowment with central bank
reserves and/or the banks' dependence on the respective foreign funding market. A
positive and significant would indicate a subdued international bank funding channel
the more excess reserves banks hold. Further, we will look at the aggregate effects of
( + )18 to capture the overall impact of monetary policy changes on NFPS lending
through the bank funding channel.
3.2 Outward transmission
To investigate how euro area monetary policy affects banks' direct cross-border
lending, we add the dimension of recipient country j to account for bank-country
financial linkages. Subscript j refers to the most important recipient countries outside
the euro area. In total for AT 11 and DE 18 recipient countries are included in the
analyses. The baseline regression then reads:

17 As LR enters the regression as part of the interaction and with four lags, it is no longer part of the vector
of control variables X.
18 The sum of the two coefficient estimates provides information about the aggregate impact of monetary
policy changes conditional on the funding structure (when controlling for the liquidity ratio).
19 A significant share of external lending is conducted in foreign currencies. However, banks report their
outstanding claims in euro. Therefore, we adjust the reported data on outstanding foreign claims for
exchange rate changes to obtain information on the mere transaction-induced lending changes.
11
Again, in a second step, we extend the baseline regression by a triple interaction where

Similar to the inward regression exercise, we are interested in the aggregate effect of
( + ) showing the impact of euro area monetary policy changes on cross-border
lending to the NFPS in countries outside the euro area through the bank funding channel
and the coefficient indicating whether surplus liquidity potentially impacts the
relevance of the bank funding channel.
4 Results
4.1 Inward transmission
To compare the country and the currency dimension of banks' funding side for the
international transmission of monetary policies, we estimate the above defined
regressions with the following bank-specific funding variables :
- External liabilities from a certain country {US UK} to total assets, and
- External liabilities in a certain currency {USD GBP} to total assets.20
Estimation results for eq. (1) are shown in Table 1; columns (1) and (2) contain results
for AT, columns (3) and (4) for DE. In particular we are interested in estimates of the
coefficient for the interaction term in this regression. As both countries receive a
substantial share of funding from abroad and in foreign currency (see Figure 3) we
would expect negative coefficient estimates. A tightening (easing) of foreign monetary
policies then would be associated with a decrease (increase) in domestic lending that is
conditional on the bank-specific share of funding from the respective country or in the
respective currency.
20 We focus on total liabilities as this includes liabilities to banks and to private investors alike and
therefore represents the most comprehensive measure (see Acharya et al. (2017) and Ivashina et al.
(2015)). For robustness, we estimated all the models for liabilities to banks as for our sample the
measures are highly and significantly correlated. The results are discussed in section 4.
12
For Austria we do not find significant estimates for . For Germany we find a negative
and significant coefficient estimate for the interaction of US monetary policy and the
funding share in USD (but not for funding rooted in the US).21 However, the coefficient
estimates are very small (a one percentage point increase in the main policy rate
translates into a decrease in lending of about 0.2 percent) and therefore the impact is
economically negligible.
We perform a series of robustness checks to examine the sensitivity of our results to
small perturbations to all specifications. These robustness tests include alternative
measures for monetary policy (i.e. the policy rate and a shadow short rate provided by
Krippner 2013), for bank funding (i.e. funding from banks) as well as additional
interactions of bank characteristics, the money market rate and the liquidity ratio.22 As
to specification (1) robustness checks for AT provide weak evidence for inward
transmission of US monetary policy as coefficient estimates turn significant with the
expected sign when including interactions of the bank-specific controls (not shown in
the table) and  as well as when using the main policy rate instead of the money
market rate. Robustness checks for DE confirm the above result in all cases.
It is surprising that we find a less stable inward transmission of US monetary policy to
Austria, although average foreign funding denominated in USD is higher than in
Germany. We have two explanations for this. Firstly, a large part of liabilities in USD
stems from Russia (see Figure 5). Assuming that these funds are mainly petrodollars or
safe haven investments, the dynamics of these flows of funds are likely to be less driven
by short-term monetary policy changes in the US. A second explanation could be a lack
of variation over time. The average USD funding share of 6 percent is mainly driven by
a small number of banks with funding shares of 40-50 percent while the median funding
share is only 2 percent. These shares display relatively little variation over time.
21 As to inward spillovers related to the UK we find some significant coefficients. However, a closer look
at the liabilities from the UK or denominated in GBP reveals that their distribution is very uneven across
banks (see Appendix 2). The majority of international banks in the German banking system have no
funding in GBP at all (the average funding share in GBP is very low with 0.26%, the median is 0). In fact,
only five percent of all observations show a funding ratio of GBP that is >1% and only four banks have
more than two percent of their funding denominated in GBP. Hence, while in aggregate funding from the
UK or the UK banking sector matters for the German banking system, it seems to be negligible for the
majority of banks. Therefore it is unlikely that changes in the price of funding are associated with
significant changes in the aggregate credit extension to the private sector. The shares are economically
negligible and the statistical significance discovered in our estimations seems to cover other dynamics
than those related to funding.
22 We refer to the results of the robustness checks in order to reinforce our main results. In the paper we
only report estimation results for the regressions described in section 3. Other estimation results are
available upon request.
13
Results for Germany indicate that an increase in USD funding costs is associated with a
mildly mitigated credit extension the more a bank funds itself in USD (in contrast to
funding originating in the US). This result might reflect the fact that only around one-
third of German banks' funding in USD actually comes from the US, while a large
share comes from offshore countries or financial centres such as the Cayman Islands
(KY), the UK, Hong Kong (HK) and elsewhere (see Figure 5). Unlike capital flows
linked to the recycling of petrodollars, USD-denominated financial investments are
arguably more sensitive to US monetary policy decisions, no matter whether they come
from onshore or offshore.

As discussed above, our sample period 2005-2015 includes periods of unconventional
monetary policy in the US, the UK and also the euro area. During these episodes of
quantitative easing, international bank funding may be a less important factor for those
banks that are less funding constrained due to excess liquidity holdings. To test this
hypothesis, we interact the banks' liquidity ratio (defined as cash and central bank
reserves to total assets) with the monetary policy changes and the transmission channel
variables (see eq. (2)). Estimation results are shown in Table 2. Positive coefficient
estimates for the triple interaction would provide support to the above hypothesis.
The aggregate impact of internationally transmitted foreign monetary policy changes on
domestic lending is measured by ( + ) and has to be determined empirically as it is
unclear ex ante which effect is dominant.
Generally our results are ambiguous and do not provide a clear picture when
considering the liquidity situation of banks (i.e. estimates of in Table 2). Those
14
estimates and significances presented in Table 2 are not confirmed by robustness checks
for either Austria or Germany. As to the transmission of monetary policy (i.e. estimates
of ( + )), we find for some of the estimations for Germany statistically significant
negative estimates for the funding share in USD. This supports our previous results on
the relevance of currency-related channels.
The liquidity endowment does not seem to be a relevant bank characteristic for the
international transmission of monetary policy. Generally the liquidity ratio as an
indicator of a banks' autonomy from funding markets can vary depending on a bank's
business model. In particular, banks that are less engaged in lending to the non-financial
private sector might show a higher liquidity ratio during periods of financial stress.
Their generally low volumes of real private sector lending might be independent from
monetary policy changes and predominantly determined by other factors. Further, other
domestic time and bank-specific factors outside of our model and contributing to
unobserved heterogeneity in the sample might play a role for domestic lending
dynamics. This includes e.g. domestic funding costs and the bank-specific reliance on
domestic funding (i.e. rooted in the euro area or denominated in euro).
Generally, as to inward transmission, our results (including all robustness checks) reveal
that spillover effects tend to be present when looking at the currency-related channels,
although several results are sensitive to changes in the specifications and monetary
policy measures. We interpret this as evidence for a superior role of funding currency
for the international transmission of monetary policy compared to the country where the
funding comes from. The country dimension underestimates the importance of, in
particular, US monetary policy for those banks that depend on US dollar funding as
substantial parts of this funding originate in third countries. The currency dimension
seems to capture this much better. The limited evidence for inward transmission is also
due to the given low shares of foreign funding for the majority of banks in the Austrian
and German banking system. In the event of changing funding patterns in the future,
however, inward transmission may reach economically significant magnitude.
4.2 Outward transmission
The largest funding share of Austria's and Germany's banks is rooted in the euro area
and denominated in euro. At the same time several banks are international creditors.
Therefore, the international bank funding channel might be more pronounced in the
outward transmission of domestic monetary policy. To test this, we analyse whether
euro area monetary policy changes affect cross-border lending of those banks. Similar
15
to the inward regressions, we examine the implications of bank heterogeneity regarding
the following funding share variables :
- Liabilities from the euro area to total assets, and
- Liabilities in EUR to total assets.
Estimation results for the baseline outward regression (see eq. (3)) are shown in Table
3. As funding from the euro area as well as in euro represent a notable share for banks
in both countries and as both banking systems have sizable cross-border exposures, we
would expect a tightening (easing) of monetary policy in the euro area to be followed by
a decrease (increase) in cross-border credit extension, i.e. positive coefficient estimates
for in eq. (3) and for ( + ) in eq. (4).23
Surprisingly we find no robust significant impact of euro area monetary policy changes
on banks' external lending contingent on the aforementioned funding characteristics ­
neither for Austria nor for Germany (see Tables 3 and 4). In our robustness checks we
only find weak evidence for outward spillovers through DE banks when looking at
funding from banks and when looking at funding in EUR and the main policy rate as
well as the shadow short rate as our monetary policy measure. However, as results are
not robust to different regression specifications and significant coefficients are generally
small, we do not interpret these findings as strong evidence in favour of outward
spillovers.
Despite the lack of evidence for an impact of euro area monetary policy changes on
cross-border lending to the non-financial private sector outside the euro area, we cannot
infer from our results that domestic monetary policy is not transmitted through local
lending of subsidiaries located abroad. For instance, the data used for the AT
estimations only cover approximately 25 percent of consolidated foreign lending. The
remaining 75 percent of foreign lending is extended by subsidiaries located outside of
Austria. For our analyses we cannot use the database for Austrian subsidiaries as it does
not provide a detailed split by currency and country on the liability side.
Further, as in particular banks from Austria have a significant footprint in Eastern
European economies, we explore whether the lending behaviour towards these countries
is different. When restricting the sample to non-euro area but EU countries (only five
23 We restrict the sample to bank-country combinations where the share of cross-border lending to the
country has a minimum share of 1 percent in total cross-border lending on average over the sample
period. This restriction reduces the sample significantly. The full sample is more than 14,000
observations, 28 banks and 63 countries for AT and more than 35,000 observations, 72 banks and 55
countries for DE. However, the remaining sample includes 53 percent of total cross border loans in AT
and 77 percent in DE over the whole sample period. Using the full sample or reducing the restriction to
0.5 percent does not qualitatively change the estimation results.
16
(AT) and eight (DE) economies remain in the sample for the estimation) we find that a
tightening (easing) of euro area monetary policy is associated with more (less) cross-
border lending to those countries from AT banks (but not from DE banks).24 It might be
that the portfolio channel works here as a tightening of monetary policy in the euro area
makes domestic (i.e. euro area) borrowers relatively more risky and banks therefore
shift parts of their business abroad, in particular to those countries where they have
established strong creditor-debtor relationships and a substantial market share. In
contrast, for DE results tend to go in the same direction as in the baseline estimation
from eq. (3). The coefficient on funding from banks is negative and significant but
hinges on the choice of the monetary policy measure.
5 Conclusion
Our paper explores the role of bank funding in the international transmission of
monetary policy. In a first step, we compare the geographic and currency dimensions of
bank funding for the banking systems of Austria and Germany using confidential bank
balance sheet data. By breaking down banks' funding according to the country where it
comes from as well as according to the currency it is denominated in, we observe that
the two dimensions differ substantially. While for both banking systems the majority of
funding is denominated in euro and originates within the euro area, the most relevant
foreign currency is the US dollar, but the most relevant foreign country is the UK, with
London being the European banking hub.
In a second step, we explore the role of international bank funding by analysing how
banks' funding, disaggregated by country or by currency, impacts the international
transmission of monetary policy to bank lending. We distinguish between inward
transmission (of foreign monetary policy to domestic lending) and outward transmission
(of euro area monetary policy to domestic banks' cross-border lending). By controlling
for the liquidity position of individual banks vis-ŕ-vis the central bank, we further
explore the role of the heterogeneity in the degree of funding necessities, i.e. of the role
of conventional and unconventional monetary policy.
Our results provide weak evidence for the international transmission of monetary policy
through banks' funding structure to credit extension by banks in AT and DE. The
monetary policy of the US, home of the major foreign funding currency, seems to affect
the supply of credit to the domestic non-financial private sector the more a bank funds

its operations in US dollars. This effect is more pronounced in Germany than in Austria.
However, these spillovers are statistically significant but not large economically. As the
major country and currency for funding of the Austrian and the German banking system
are, respectively, the euro area and the euro, this result is of little surprise. As for
outward transmission, we do not find evidence for an impact of monetary policy
changes in the euro area on direct cross-border lending.
Generally, our estimation results are not very robust to changes in the specifications and
alternative monetary policy measures. Therefore we are reluctant to argue in favour of
bank funding structures being a major transmission channel for international spillovers
of monetary policy. Other particular characteristics of banks are likely to be associated
with a higher responsiveness to monetary policy changes. However, our work shows
that it does make a difference whether positions that are deemed to act as international
transmission channels of monetary policy are defined by country or by currency.
