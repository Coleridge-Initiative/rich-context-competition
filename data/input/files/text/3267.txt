Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors
in women.1 However, the pathogenesis of breast cancer
remains unclear.2­4 Previous studies have suggested that
the renin­angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the
mechanism of breast cancer.5­7 Also, recently published
data indicated that angiotensin II, the main biologically
active peptide of RAS, contributed to breast cancer devel-
opment and progression.8,9 The peptide hormone angioten-
sin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that exerts its actions
through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R).
Angiotensin II receptors are of two types: type 1 (AT1)
receptor and type 2 (AT2) receptor.10 Receptor binding
studies provide important information regarding the distri-
bution of AT1 and AT2 receptors and the sites of action and
physiological roles of angiotensin.11,12 Polymorphism in
the AT1R A1166C gene (SNP ID: rs5186) has been widely
studied and found to be associated with breast cancer.13­15

Abstract
Objective: Previous studies on the relationship between angiotensin  type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene (A1166C)
polymorphism and breast cancer did not reach the same conclusion. In the present study, we aimed to further evaluate
the relationship between the AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism and breast cancer risk.
Methods: We selected five case-control studies related to AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism and breast cancer by
searching PubMed, EMBase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese CNKI, Web of Science, and the Wanfang
database. We utilized Q-test and I2 test to detect the heterogeneity between each study. A random-effects model (I2 >
50%; p < 0.10) or a fixed-effects model (I2 < 50%; p > 0.10) was utilized to merge the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) during the meta- analyses.
Results: The present study included 972 patients with breast cancer and 1336 cancer-free control subjects. By meta-
analysis, we found A1166C polymorphism was associated with decreased risk for breast cancer in Caucasian population
in an additive model (C vs. T: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62­0.96, p = 0.02). However, we did not find associations in other
genetic models (AC+CC vs. AA: OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.50­1.22, p = 0.28; CC vs. AA+AC: OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 0.94­2.85,
p = 0.08).
Conclusion: We concluded that AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism was associated with reduced risk for breast cancer.

The AT1R gene is composed of five exons located on chro-
mosome 3q, where the first four exons encode the
5-untranslated region (5- UTR). A polymorphism in the
3-UTR of the AT1R gene leads to the transfer of adenine
(A) to cytosine (C) base at the 1166 position.16,17 The AT1R
gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of breast
cancer and the cardiovascular system.18,19 Several studies
have suggested that AT1R A1166C gene polymorphism is
associated with breast cancer risk and prognosis,13,15,20­22
while other studies have shown no significant association
with breast risk.23,24 In 2010, Xi et al. performed a meta-
analysis and found that AT1R A1166C polymorphisms
might be implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.25
However, Xi et al.'s conclusion was limited by the small
sample size (only two publications included).
Therefore, we performed an update meta-analysis to
further clarify the relationship between AT1R A1166C
polymorphism and breast cancer risk.
Materials and methods
Literature identification
To identify all the articles that reported the association of
AT1R A1166C polymorphisms with breast cancer risk, we
conducted a computerized literature search of PubMed,
EMBase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese
CNKI, Web of Science, and the Wanfang database using
the terms "breast cancer (Mesh)," "angiotensin II type 1
receptor" or "AT1R," "polymorphism" or "SNP," "geno-
type," or "variation" without any restriction on language or
publication year. By means of online retrieval and literature
review, references obtained using the above-mentioned
databases were reviewed again to ensure that no relevant
studies were missed.
All the included studies had to meet the following
inclusion criteria: (1) independently published case-con-
trol or cohort studies on the relation between AT1R poly-
morphism and breast cancer; (2) similar themes and
methods; (3) the genotype data available. We excluded the
literature in which the relevant data are not available or
there is heterogeneity of gene polymorphism in the control
population.
Quality assessment and data extraction
Two reviewers (Fangguo Chen and Guiling Chen) inde-
pendently evaluated the studies and extracted the data
using a standard approach according to the above-men-
tioned inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved
through discussion. The Cochrane Handbook 5.2 quality
evaluation criteria were utilized to assess the methodologi-
cal quality of included studies. Literature that had been
reported repeatedly or poor-quality literature were
excluded from the included studies.
For each study, we extracted the first author's last name,
year of publication, ethnicity of participants, numbers of
cases and controls, and frequency of AA, AC, and CC gen-
otypes. The Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium was assessed
using the 2 test.
Statistical analysis
We performed the meta-analyses utilizing RevMan 5.2
software. Both Q-test and I2 test were directly utilized to
examine the heterogeneity between each study. The asso-
ciation between A1166C polymorphisms of the AT1R gene
and the risk of breast cancer was estimated by calculating
pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
The significance of the pooled OR was determined by Z
test (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). A
random- or fixed-effects model was used to calculate
pooled effect estimates in the presence (p < 0.10) or
absence (p > 0.10) of heterogeneity, respectively. Subgroup
analyses were performed according to ethnicity. Sensitivity
analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the
results by removing one single study from the overall
pooled analysis each time to check the influence of the
removed data set to the overall ORs. Publication bias was
assessed by RevMan 5.2 statistical software to make the
funnel plot. A P < 0.05 was considered as a significant
difference.
Results
Study identification
As shown in Figure 1, 48 literature studies were prelimi-
narily detected; 42 of these were excluded as being obvi-
ously irrelevant from reading their titles and abstracts.
Thus, six articles met the inclusion criteria. However, the
study by Koh et al. was excluded because it examined the
associations of three AT1R polymorphisms (namely
A168G, C535T, and T825A) rather than A1166C polymor-
phism.26 Therefore, five studies with a total of 972 patients
with breast cancer and 1336 cancer-free control subjects
were included in this research.15,20­23 Four of these studies
were performed in a Caucasian population,15,20,22,23 while
only one study was conducted in a Chinese population.21
The characteristics of the studies included are shown in
Table 1.
Association of A1166C polymorphism and
breast cancer risk
The results of meta-analysis of the association between
breast cancer and AT1R gene polymorphism in five case-
control studies are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The heteroge-
neity test of the various studies revealed heterogeneous
results ((AC+CC) vs. AA: I2 = 85%, p < 0.0001; C allele
Chen et al. 853
vs. A allele: I2 = 85%, p < 0.0001); therefore, we used the
random-effects model in the analysis. However, we did not
find heterogeneity between each study in a dominant
model (AA+AC vs. CC: I2 = 44%, p = 0.13); thus we used
the fixed-model to merge the OR value. In all studies,
including Caucasian and Asian populations, we did not

find an association between A1166C polymorphism and
breast cancer in any genetic model ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR
= 0.97, 95% CI: 0.54­1.72, p = 0.91; (AA+AC) vs. CC:
OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76­2.01; C allele vs. A allele: OR =
0.95, 95% CI: 0.58­1.54, P = 0.83; Figure 2). Subgroup
analysis according to ethnicity suggested that A1166C
polymorphism was associated with decreased risk for
breast cancer in Caucasian populations in an additive
model (C vs. T: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62­0.96, p = 0.02).
However, we did not find association in other genetic
models (AC+CC vs. AA: OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.50­1.22;
CC vs. AA+AC: OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 0.94­2.85) in
Caucasian populations (Figure 3).
Publication bias analysis
The result of Egger's test did not show statistical evidence
for bias (data not shown). This indicates that there is no
publication bias, and the result of the study is credible.
Sensitivity analysis
We deleted one single study from the overall pooled analy-
sis each time to check the influence of the removed data set
to the overall ORs. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs were not
significantly altered when any part of the study was omit-
ted, which indicated that any single study had little impact
on the overall ORs.

Discussion
In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to eval-
uate the association of AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism
with breast cancer. We found C allele carriers have a lower
risk for breast cancer in Caucasian populations. This study
is an update meta-analysis in which the results were differ-
ent from the previous one.25 Previous studies suggested
that the RAS plays an important role in the regulation of
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation,27,28
which indicated that RAS genes might be implicated in the
carcinogenesis.
AT1R not only has an important role in the regulation of
blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis,29,30 but
also influences tumor cell proliferation, migration, angio-
genesis, and inflammation.31,32 Recently, a SNPs A1166C
polymorphism was reported to be associated with the risk
for breast cancer.15,21,22 However, the results were incon-
sistent between each study.
One published meta-analysis including only two case-
control studies showed a significant association between
AT1R polymorphism and breast cancer risk.25 However,
there are several studies that had not been included in their
meta-analysis.

In the present study, we included five case-control
studies to perform a meta-analysis. The results suggested
that the AT1R 1166C allele is a protective factor for breast
cancer in Caucasian populations. However, we did not
find that the 1166CC genotype was associated with
reduced risk for breast cancer. Since only one study was
conducted in an Asian population,21 we did not include
this study in the subgroup analysis. This fact may be a
limitation of our study.
In conclusion, the present study suggests that the 1166C
allele of the AT1R gene is associated with reduced risk for
breast cancer in Caucasian populations. However, there is
still a need for further research and screening of etiological
relations between the functional polymorphism loci of the
AT1R gene and the susceptibility of breast cancer.
