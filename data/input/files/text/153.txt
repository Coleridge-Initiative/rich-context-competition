Tax vs. Regulation Policy and the Location of
Financial Sector FDI
Abstract
This paper analyzes how corporate taxation and regulatory requirements affect the location of
financial sector FDI. We use novel information on new financial services entities established by
multinational firms in 83 host countries. We find a negative effect of host country taxes on the
probability of choosing a particular host location. We can also confirm a significant influence of
the regulatory environment. For example, stricter (equity) capital requirements negatively affect
location probabilities. Our empirical approach allows us to provide new insight in how a policy
measure of a given country affects other countries by estimating cross-country tax and
regulation elasticities.

1. Introduction
Foreign direct investment (FDI) of the financial sector has substantially increased during the
last decades. For example, the share of foreign owned banks jumped from 20% in 1995 to
34% in 2009.1 The emergence of global banks is closely related to the emergence of
multinational companies (MNCs) whose international operations require services like lending,
currency or cash management. Particularly after the recent financial crisis many countries
have seen a need to restrict banks' international activities. More and more global banks, on
the other hand, express their concerns about excessive compliance costs associated with
stricter regulation. Some of them even reconsider their international strategies as the costs of
being global seem to exceed the benefits thereof (see the Economist, Global banks, A world
of pain, March 7th, 2015, p. 59-61).
The revelations about the so-called "Luxembourg leaks" drew even more attention to
international banking and tax issues.2 Several banks were involved in complex cross-border
lending structures set up to avoid taxes and benefit from Luxembourg's many tax exemptions.
In addition, some banks supported their clients in tax evasion through Luxembourg-based
subsidiaries.3 All this has led legislators of many countries to impose new and stricter
regulations. For example, under the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
passed in 2010, financial institutions all over the world are supposed to exchange information
on American clients vis ŕ vis the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to make it more difficult
for tax dodgers to hide money abroad. Another example is the OECD's (2013) action plan
against base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).

Although there is broad agreement that policy action is needed, it is not clear which policy
measures are the most effective ones or whether they are effective at all. Bank regulation has
so far been the dominant approach to tame risky banks. For example, in response to the
financial crisis, the Basel III agreement of September 2010 tightened capital requirement rules
to increase equity buffers and make the banking system more resilient to shocks. The same
goal ­ discouraging low capitalization ­ may be achieved by designing the tax system such
that it does not reward excessive debt financing. Keen (2011) provides a theoretical analysis
of the interaction between regulation and taxation, building on a seminal study by Weitzman
(1974). Whereas in theory, tax and regulation policies may be considered perfect substitutes,
practical considerations suggest that both policy instruments should be used.
The efficiency of regulatory measures has been explored in a number of studies, especially in
the context of risk taking (Admati et al. 2010; Hart and Zingales 2011). Several European
countries followed suggestions by the IMF and implemented bank levies as a reaction to the
financial crisis. Devereux et al. (2013) analyze the impact of these levies and find evidence
that they indeed did cause an increase in capital stocks of banks. At the same time, however,
such a levy could result in an increase of risk in a bank's assets and therefore undermine the
benefit of additional capital (Devereux 2014). So far, only little is known how such policies
affect the international allocation of financial sector FDI and particularly how sensitive
MNCs' location decisions respond to tax vs. regulation policy.
This paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of financial sector FDI in a number
of ways. First, using data on the universe of German outbound financial services FDI, we
consider all new location choices of German MNCs over a time span of 13 years. Second, we
analyze the effects of tax and regulation policy using new data on 83 potential host countries.
Third, we provide estimates on own- and cross-elasticities to learn about how a change in tax
3
and regulation policy of one country affects not only the probability that this country is
chosen as a location but also how this affects the location probabilities of other countries.
Only very few papers have studied how taxes affect financial services FDI before. A recent
contribution by Huizinga et al. (2014) finds that banking FDI is determined by host country
taxes. Moreover, Claessens et al. (2001) find that low host country taxes are associated with
additional banking FDI. Evidence on regulation policy and location choices of multinational
banks is similarly scarce. While a number of papers examine how financial sector FDI is
affected by regulation policy (e.g., Buch and Lipponer 2007; Tsai et al. 2011), none of these
papers has analyzed how regulation policy affects the extensive margin of foreign activity in a
discrete choice model.
Our analysis is based on financial services FDI data provided by Deutsche Bundesbank (the
German central bank). This data allows us to identify new establishments of German
multinationals all over the world during the period 2000-2012. In an average year during this
period, about 250 new entities have been established by German MNCs in foreign countries.
The most important host countries for financial services FDI are the US, where 760 new
entities have been established over the whole time span considered, the UK, where we count
524 new establishments, and the Netherlands with 251 new establishments.
Our preferred specification ­ using a mixed logit estimation approach ­ implies a significant
impact of tax and regulation variables on location probabilities. We find significant
heterogeneity of tax responses. For example, if the tax is cut by 1 percent in Great Britain, the
probability of attracting financial sector FDI increases by about 1.1 percent. In contrast, a 1
percent tax cut in Spain increases the location probability of Spain by only 0.3 percent. If
regulation in Canada becomes more lenient as the country reduces capital requirements by 1
percent, the probability of attracting new financial sector entities from Germany is increased
4
by almost 8 percent, ceteris paribus. Thus, while our results imply a lot of heterogeneity in
terms of estimated elasticities, a general result is that tax and regulation policy can be used to
attract financial sector FDI.
Our estimation approach also allows us to compute cross-elasticities that suggest interesting
substitution patterns. For example, if Great Britain cuts its local tax rate by 1 percent, Great
Britain will gain (see above) at the expense of other countries like China, whose location
probability will be reduced by 0.107 percent. Such findings have policy implications, as
uncoordinated policy action of one country imposes an externality on other countries. Hence,
particularly regulation policy should be coordinated across countries.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly introduces a generic
theoretical framework, which our empirical analysis is based on. In Section 3 we discuss the
determinants of financial sector FDI. Section 4 explains the empirical approach and describes
the data. Empirical results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.
2. The Extensive Margin of Financial Sector FDI
Our empirical analysis is based on a theoretical concept of comparison of expected profits
across alternatives (countries).4 Let us denote profits of a multinational firm b arising at a
foreign financial services entity established in country j as 
 . The asterisk indicates that 
is a latent variable, which is not observed by the researcher. The actual choice of firm b ­ the
location choice or extensive margin of foreign investment activity ­ is based on the maximum
attainable profit when choosing one of j = 0,1,2,...,J potential host countries:

= (0
 , 1
 , 2
 , ... , 
 ).
4 This has been introduced by McFadden (1974) who showed that an empirical discrete choice model ­ as the
one we are using in this paper ­ can be obtained from a theoretical model of utility comparison.
5
Below, we will define a binary choice indicator which takes on value one for the respective
alternative chosen (where profits are highest), and zero for all the other alternatives not
chosen. Thus, above equation suggests that all variables affecting 
 will determine in which
country a firm b is locating its foreign business. We may say that any generic variable 
that
positively affects profits,



> 0, will make it more likely to increase the probability that b
chooses a particular location. The potential determinants 
affecting 
 will be discussed in
the following sections.
3. Determinants of Financial Sector FDI
Previous literature on the determinants of financial sector FDI has mainly focused on foreign
investments of multinational banks. One part of this literature has examined which banks
become multinational and found that the size of a bank (Focarelli and Pozollo 2001; Clarke et
al. 2003; Buch und Lipponer 2007; Temesvary 2014a), its balance sheet health (Popov and
Udell 2012), and its productivity (Buch et al. 2014) are particularly important determinants.
This paper is interested in how a financial services firm chooses a location for its foreign
activity. The following sections will present an overview on the literature that identified a
number of host-country characteristics that seem to be important determinants for location
decisions of multinational banks.5
3.1 Determinants of Financial Services FDI
Many determinants of goods trade and FDI will be similarly important in context of financial
services FDI. First, the distance between host country and home country of a firm is
considered to be one major driver of economic integration. While in case of goods trade
distance is associated with transportation costs, distance seems to be important for financial
5 In these studies, the role of policy instruments like tax and regulation policies are often neglected, however.
6
services as it affects the availability and quality of information. The specific business model
of banks requires collecting and processing information on customers to provide financial
services on competitive terms (Rajan 1992; Petersen and Rajan 2002). Thus, a lower distance
between the home country and the host country of an investment should be favorable since
this reduces information asymmetries between headquarters or parents and foreign entities
(Berger et al. 2004; Liberti and Mian 2009). Several studies found empirical evidence for
distance as an important determinant of investment locations (Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005;
Buch and Lipponer 2007; Claessens and van Horen 2014). As more and more companies
started to export to foreign markets and became multinational firms, financial services across
borders became more important as well. Several studies demonstrate that foreign activities of
banks and bilateral trade volumes between countries are positively correlated (Brealey and
Kaplanis 1996; Yamori 1998; Buch 2000; Berger et al. 2004; Focarelli and Pozzolo 2001,
2005). Other determinants of foreign banking relate to cultural characteristics such as
common language, which should facilitate the successful market entry in a host country.
Evidence suggests that cultural variables are important determinants of international banking
(Buch 2003; Focarelli and Pozzolo 2005). Moreover, a wide range of host-country
characteristics that affect the profitability of foreign entities should have an impact on the
location choice of financial services firms. For example, previous studies show that market
size and GDP per capita are associated with additional bank FDI (Yamori 1998; Buch 2000;
Claessens et al. 2001; Cerruti et al. 2007). Focarelli and Pozzolo (2001; 2005) identify
expected economic growth in the host country and local bank inefficiencies as additional
determinants of location choices.
Finally, very recent literature focuses on the effects of the financial crisis on banking sector
FDI. Several studies find a decline in foreign activities associated with the financial crisis
(Cetorelli and Goldberg 2009, 2011; Temesvary 2014a, 2014b). Buch et al. (2014) provide
7
evidence that the changing market conditions triggered by the financial crisis led banks to
reduce their international assets. In addition, they identify policy interventions and banks'
increasing sensitivity towards financial frictions as main drivers behind this reduction.
3.2 Bank Regulation
One argument often used in policy debate is that deregulation policy has been responsible for
the rampant expansion of banking across the world (Buch 2003).6 In line with this view,
regulatory requirements are expected to increase market entry costs and deter foreign activity
(Lehner 2009; Tsai et al. 2011). In a similar way, if regulators impose high capital (equity)
requirements and liquidity rules, this should unambiguously increase a bank's cost of capital
and therefore have a negative effect on foreign activity. On the other hand, enhanced
transparency through tight government regulation and supervision might reduce
aforementioned information asymmetries and could even facilitate foreign activity. Buch
(2003) argues that the effect of regulatory requirements might also differ across countries, and
finds a limiting effect of tighter regulation on foreign activity, on average.
Buch and Lipponer (2007) confirm a negative relationship between bank FDI and higher
capital controls. However, a tight regulatory supervisory system in the host country does not
necessarily limit foreign FDI. Buch and DeLong (2004) argue that the effect of information
costs on banks' cross-border mergers is far more pronounced than the effect of regulation
costs. Temesvary (2014a; 2014b) examines a sample of US banks and the effects of host-
country characteristics on foreign banking activities. Her results indicate that market entry
costs, which in her sample are associated with regulatory constraints, have a negative impact
on banks' foreign activities. In contrast, Bertus et al. (2008) find no connection between
foreign bank ownership and the regulatory framework in a particular country.
6Moreover, research has been concerned in the relationship between deregulation and excessive risk taking
(Keeley 1990; Hovakimian and Kane 2000; Admati et al. 2010; Hart and Zingales 2011).
8
3.3 Taxation
Corporate income taxes reduce the return on investment available for the shareholder. In an
international context, a foreign affiliate of a multinational firm is subject to tax in its host
country. Therefore, a low tax at the host location is associated with higher residual income
that can be distributed to the parent firm. The repatriation of income is then usually exempt
from home country taxation.7 A number of studies have analyzed the influence of taxes on
FDI (for reviews cf. De Mooij and Ederveen 2003, 2005; Feld and Heckemeyer 2011). Only
relatively few papers analyzed how taxes affect the extensive margin of foreign activity by
focusing on location decisions of multinational firms. These studies provide evidence that
host country taxes exert a negative effect on location probabilities (Devereux and Griffith
1998; Grubert and Mutti 2004; Buettner and Ruf 2007; Buettner and Wamser 2009; Barrios et
al. 2012).
While none of the studies mentioned above considers financial sector FDI, the findings in
Overesch and Wamser (2009) suggest that financial sector FDI is particularly responsive to
taxes. The study distinguishes between FDI from different industries among them financial
services. The results show that the responses to host country taxes differ significantly across
different business activities. Although their data does not include multinational banks, their
estimates suggest a particularly strong effect of corporate taxes on location choices of
subsidiaries that provide financial services within multinational firms. To the best of our
knowledge, only two more studies have analyzed the impact of taxes on FDI of multinational
banks. Claessens et al. (2001) find a negative relationship between host country tax rate and
banking FDI. Huizinga et al. (2014) find that international double taxation of dividends
reduces banking FDI. However, these studies use information about bank assets, while our
7 Only the US and a small number of other countries consider all types of foreign income as part of taxable
profits of the parent corporation. At the same time, these countries usually provide tax credits on taxes paid
abroad. This system is, however, not relevant for our paper, as Germany exempts all foreign income from
taxation in the home country.
9
paper focusses on the question of how taxes affect the choice among alternative locations
when setting up a new foreign financial services entity.
4. Empirical Approach and Data
4.1 Mixed Logit
We are interested in the determinants of location choices of multinational banks and
particularly how taxes and regulation affect these choices. We base our empirical analysis on
a mixed logit model, which is associated with a number of favorable features that are
important with respect to the specific research goals we have in this paper. In particular, the
two main advantages are (i) that the mixed logit allows us to learn about (realistic)
substitution patterns across alternatives and (ii) that it allows for correlation in unobserved
factors across alternatives (countries).
A very intuitive interpretation of the mixed logit model is one of error components creating
correlations among the profits for different alternatives (see Train 2009). As outlined in
Section 2, the underlying model we have in mind when multinational firm b chooses a foreign
location is one where the firm maximizes profits 
 .
Let us neglect the asterisk we used to denote latent variables and specify profits of
multinational bank b obtained from alternative (country) j as

= 
+ 
 
+ 
. (1)
The vectors 
and 
denote observed country-j-specific characteristics. While  is a
vector of fixed coefficients to be estimated, 
is a vector of random terms with zero mean,
and 
is assumed to be independently, identically distributed extreme value. To the extent
that 
and 
are indexed by t, we allow each of these variables to depend on the
10
respective observables in a given year t. We will also consider that one firm may face
different choice situations over time, but then treat coefficients 
that enter utility as
constant for each b. Note that we want to specifically model a choice as one where b chooses
from alternatives, so that the focus is on cross-sectional variation in determinants. Of course,
since 
is indexed by multinational b, coefficients vary across firms. One of the key issues
in specifying this model is the choice of 
. Together with 
, 
defines the stochastic
portion of profits as 
= 
 
+ 
(Train 2009). By specifying 
, we allow for
correlation across alternatives (countries) i and j, 8 so that (
, 
) = (
 
+

)(
 
+ 
) = 
 , with  being the covariance of .
The specific variables included in 
and 
are discussed in more detail below. While

will capture country characteristics such as the log of a country's GDP or the
geographical distance to Germany, the specification of 
is important as these variables
induce correlation over alternatives. Since we are interested in cross-country elasticities
related to tax and bank regulation policy, 
includes country j's tax rate and different
measures for regulation. In the presence of profit shifting, if MNCs operate internal capital
markets or if other intra-firm relations are important, it is highly likely that these variables
induce correlation across alternatives' unobserved parts.9
8 The conditional logit does not allow for correlation in the unobserved parts of 
 , which gives rise to the so-
called IIA (independence from irrelevant alternatives) assumption. Besides providing consistent estimates on tax
and regulation variables, we are particularly interested in substitution patterns across countries. Hence, we need
to relax this assumption as it would imply a proportional shifting pattern across alternatives.
9 Another interpretation of the mixed logit model is one of a random coefficient model. It seems highly likely
that firms respond very heterogeneously to taxes, depending on the extent to which firms can avoid taxes, for
example.
11
4.2 Financial Services FDI Data
Our empirical analysis is based on the micro-level dataset MiDi (Micro Database Direct
Investment) provided by Deutsche Bundesbank (the German central bank). MiDi is a panel
dataset on foreign direct investment positions of German investors. It basically records
information about the investment object's balance sheet, some information on the type of
investment (e.g., industry), and limited information on the investor. Particularly noteworthy is
that German law enforces data collection of foreign activity of German investors,10 which
enables us to observe virtually all German outbound activity.
While MiDi reports foreign investments across all different industries, we will focus on a sub-
sample of financial services entities of German multinationals. To be included in our dataset,
the latter are required to have a direct participating interest in the foreign entity of more than
50% (majority owners). However, the German headquarters do not necessarily have to
operate in the financial sector. These restrictions leave us with 839 MNCs that establish 3,790
new financial sector entities (between 2000 and 2012) in 83 host countries.11 The vast
majority of foreign entities are legally independent subsidiaries (3,546 ones) only few are set
up as branches.
For each of the 3,790 newly established subsidiaries, we consider which location is effectively
chosen among the 83 potential host countries. As our dependent variable we compute an
indicator variable LOCDECbjt
that equals 1 for the location effectively chosen and zero for the
J-1 (82) alternative host countries not chosen. Considering the information of all location
10 Section 26 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (Aussenwirtschaftsgesetz) in connection with the Foreign
Trade and Payment Regulations (Aussenwirtschaftsverordnung).
11 An overview is given in Table 8, see the Appendix.
12
choices in the financial sector between 2000 and 2012, our sample includes 309,912
observations.12
4.3 Tax and Regulation Data
Regarding tax incentives we consider the statutory corporate tax rate, STRjt
, to capture
expected tax payments in a host country of foreign entities.13 This variable is collected by the
authors from different sources (International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation, IBFD; tax
surveys provided by Ernst&Young, PwC, and KPMG). Another tax variable is DTTjt
which
measures the total number of double taxation treaties concluded by a host country j. This
variable is available from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) and is included as a tightly-knit network of DTTs may facilitate cross-border
capital flows of dividends, interest, and royalties, which might be important for the
multinational bank.
To account for host countries' regulatory framework we rely on three different variables.
First, RATIOjt
measures the equity ratio required in the respective host country. This variable
was taken from several waves of a survey conducted by Barth et al. (2001).14 Since increased
equity requirements are usually assumed to impose a cost on firms, we expect a negative
effect on foreign activities. In our data, RATIOjt
varies between 0.05 and 0.19. Many countries
impose minimum equity ratios as suggested by Basel II regulation (0.08), some countries like
Nigeria or the United Arab Emirates require significantly higher equity ratios (0.19 and 0.12).
12 The total number of observations is not 314,570 (=3,790  83) due to missing control variables for some
country-year pairs.
13 Concerning Luxemburg, we assume a statutory tax rate of zero due to Luxembourg's known holding regimes
and ruling system. However, alternative regressions in which we excluded Luxemburg confirm our results.
14 The survey was repeated with the current 4th round being published in 2012.
13
The second measure we use to capture the regulatory environment is called REGjt
.15 This
variable is also based on an index developed by Barth et al.'s (2001) survey published by the
World Bank.16 It consists of four components indicating the strictness of jurisdictions when
banks engage in financial activities. To be specific, REGjt
is defined as the sum over the four
variables RSECjt
, RINSjt
, RREALjt
, and RNONFINjt
. Each of these variables is increasing in
the strictness of how a country j is regulating banks' activities in securities (RSECjt
),
insurance (RINSjt
), real estate (RREALjt
), or non-financial activities (RNONFINjt
). Strictness is
measured by scores ranging from 1 to 4.17 Our variable REGjt
combines all four categories
into one measure. Higher values in REGjt
are associated with a less attractive location for
banks. In our data, Indonesia exhibits the highest value (16) of REGjt
.
Banks are not only incentivized by their own tax planning opportunities, they may also have
good reason to establish branches and subsidiaries in locations favored by their clients.
Therefore, in additional specifications, we add BANKSECj
to account for the level of secrecy
of the respective location when it comes to tax issues.18
It may be interesting to see how regulation policy relates to tax policy. To do this, we have
produced Figures 1 and 2. In both figures, STRj
(averaged over all years in our sample) is
displayed on the horizontal axis, while the measures for regulation are displayed on the
vertical axes (RATIOj
in Figure 1; REGj
in Figure 2). Very surprisingly, it seems that
regulation policy is only weakly (negatively) related to tax policy in case of RATIOj
: higher
taxes may allow for laxer regulation. Both figures illustrate that there is a lot of variation
across countries in the main variables of interest for this study.
15 Cerruti et al. (2007) and Tsai et al. (2011) use the index in a similar context.
16 An overview on the data and survey updates can be found at http://go.worldbank.org/SNUSW978P0.
17 A value of 1 for RSECjt
, as an example, indicates that a full range of securities activities can be conducted
directly by banks. The strictest value which equals 4 indicates that none of these activities can be done in either
banks or their subsidiaries in the respective country.
18 We use this variable only in robustness tests. The reason is that due to a poor coverage across countries, we
lose about half of the observations compared to our basic specification.

4.4 Non-Tax and Non-Regulation Determinants
In line with existing work on the determinants of FDI, we consider the following non-tax and
non-regulation variables. First, to capture the size of the local market, we use (log)GDPjt
.
Second, the growth of GDP in country j, GDPgrowthjt
, is included to capture growth
possibilities. Both variables are taken from the World Bank's World Development Indicators.
In addition, we use variables to control for cultural and geographical distance between
Germany (the country of the investors) and host countries j. The geographical distance is
denoted by (log)DISTj
, CONTj
and COMLANGj
are dummy variables indicating whether host
country j shares a common border with Germany (CONTj
) and whether German is an official
language in the host country (COMLANGj
). More distant countries (in geographical distance
and cultural distance) are expected to attract less FDI. In particular, as communication and
information exchange is important in context of financial services FDI, we expect these
variables to be important determinants with a negative expected sign for (log)DISTj
; variables
CONTj
and COMLANGj
should positively relate to the probability that country j is chosen. All
latter three variables are taken from the Centre d'Études prospectives et d'Informations
Internatinales (CEPII).
Similar to the DTT variable as introduced above, we use the number of bilateral investment
treaties concluded by country j, BITjt
. Bilateral investment treaties have been shown to be an
effective policy instrument to attract FDI as they reduce foreign market entry cost (Egger and
Merlo 2012). BITs may be less relevant, however, in the context of financial sector FDI. The
information on BITs is taken from UNCTAD.

5. Results
Table 1 presents basic results from mixed logit estimations. As argued above, we specify tax
and regulation variables as random (STRjt
, RATIOjt
, REGjt
), while all other control variables
are defined as fixed. The results show that tax and regulation responses are heterogeneous
across firms (see also the highly significant estimates for the standard deviations), but the
mean coefficients are estimated with the expected signs: A higher tax at location j leads to
less financial sector FDI, stricter regulation in form of stricter capital requirements, as well as
higher values of the regulation index are associated with less financial sector FDI. The
estimated coefficients for the variables entering as fixed are in line with theoretical
expectations. Only the negative estimate for GDPgrowthjt
may seem unusual. One
explanation for this is that more growth allows local and multinational firms to finance locally
through their own earnings. Another explanation may be that financial sector FDI often goes
to already developed countries which exhibit usually rather low or modest GDP growth rates.
Less distant countries in terms of cultural distance (COMLANGj
) between Germany and host
country j as well as geographical distance (DISTj
) increase the probability to be chosen as host
country, as expected.
Before providing some quantitative interpretations of these results, we may look at predicted
base probabilities for a country to be chosen as a host location. Table 2 shows that the base
probability is predicted to be relatively low (below 1 percent) for countries like Australia
(AUS = 0.0061), Hong Kong (HKG = 0.0070) or Singapore (SGP = 0.0046), and relatively
high for countries like the United States (USA = 0.0955), Austria (AUT = 0.0368) or Belgium
(BEL = 0.0483). However, the country for which we predict the highest base probability is
Great Britain, for which we estimate a base probability that exceeds 10 percent.

5.1 Own- and Cross-Elasticities for Changes in Tax and Regulation Variables
Our estimation approach not only allows us to find out about how a change in a policy
variable of country j affects the probability to locate in country j, it also allows us to find out
about substitution elasticities across alternatives (countries). For example, we may answer
questions of the following type: How does a 1 percent change in taxes in the US affect the
probability to locate in the US, in Canada, or in the UK. We present estimates on own- and
cross elasticities for a number of countries in Tables 3 and 4. Before discussing the results, let
us look at the formal representation of how a change in the mth element of the vector of
explanatory variables (e.g. RATIO) of one country, say j, affects the location probability of
country i (see Train 2009). Expressed as an elasticity, the percentage change in the probability
is given by



= -



 
()
() = -
  
() [

()

] ().
This representation of the change in location probability highlights that changes in
probabilities depend on the correlation between 
() and 
(), which denote the choice
probabilities over different values of  . This implies that substitution patterns crucially
depend on the specification of explanatory variables and the assumption on the mixing
distribution. Tables 3 and 4 present own- and cross-elasticities for STR and RATIO and the
same selection of countries as in Table 2. The tables are organized such that each cell
19
provides the tax or regulation effect on a country in a row with respect to a 1 percent increase
of STR (RATIO) of the country in a column. For example, if Singapore reduces its tax rate by
1 percent, all other countries lose in terms of lower location probabilities. However, our
estimation approach allows that the reduction in probability mass is heterogeneously
distributed across countries, i.e. some countries lose more (e.g., Hong Kong) than others (e.g.,
Belgium). The bold diagonal elements in the respective table denote own-elasticities. For
example, if the tax is cut by 1 percent in Great Britain (GRB), the probability of attracting
financial sector FDI increases by about 1.01 percent. Although a tax of a given country
usually comes at the cost of other countries (one country attracts FDI at the expense of
others), our results suggest interesting complementarities for some country-relations. For
example, while we expect a US-tax-cut-policy to attract new financial services entities, there
seem to be positive spillovers to other countries. In particular, countries that are associated
with a high cultural or geographical proximity to the US (as Australia or Canada) benefit from
lower taxes there. Such complementarities are in line with learning arguments that arise
within multinational firm networks (Egger et al. 2014a).
Table 4 further suggests that the responsiveness of German financial services FDI to
regulation at the extensive margin is highly sensitive, expressed in form of elasticities. The
estimated own-elasticities range from about 4 (RUS) to 9.2 (SGP). For example, a 1 percent
lower capital ratio (a 1 percent lower equity requirement) imposed by Great Britain is
estimated to increase the probability to locate there by about 5.3 percent. The estimates
confirm that RATIO is an extremely important determinant of location choice and that
locations with lax capital requirements are particularly attractive for German MNCs. Other
than in case of STR, the estimated cross-elasticities are negative, irrespective of the country
combination. Given the way how we have specified the vector of random variables, and given
significant differences in countries' tax incentives, the finding of (some) positive tax-cross-
20
elasticities (and throughout negative regulation-cross-elasticities at the same time) is fully
consistent with profit-shifting considerations. In fact, the latter explains why tax responses
differ in the first place (Egger et al. 2014b).

5.2 Robustness
Table 5 includes 2 additional robustness specifications. In column (1) we add an indicator
variable for a high level of bank secrecy taken from the OECD (2006). Since information
about bank secrecy is not available for all countries, we can only consider a slightly smaller
set of locations as in Table 1. However, almost all important host countries with a significant
number of new financial service entities are included. We find a positive effect of bank
secrecy on financial sector location decisions.
The second important finding is that the results for the tax rate and bank regulation variables
are hardly affected: Table 5 still suggests a significant negative effect of a higher tax rate and
higher capital requirement on the probability to set up a new entity in a certain country.
Moreover, a high score for the overall level of bank regulation, indicating strict limitations, is
again associated with a smaller probability to choose a host country.
In specification (2) of Table 5 we analyze if all regulation components affect location choices.
Our results suggest that location choices are particularly responsive to restrictions of
securities transactions but also to limitations of activities outside the financial sector, while
restrictions of insurance activities and real estate transactions do not matter. Once again, our
findings concerning taxes and capital requirements remain quite robust.

5.3 Policy Experiments
Based on the results in Table 1, we may estimate how countries are affected by a unilateral
policy choice of the United States. For example, in a first experiment we estimate the losses
measured in probability mass associated with a total abolishment of equity regulation in the
US (RATIOUS
= 0). Figure 3 shows that the burden of such a policy is very unevenly
distributed across countries facing the policy externality. While some countries are heavily
affected, the effect on many countries is hardly measurable.
The estimates suggest that the biggest losers of the one-sided US policy action would be the
UK (-0.08), France (-0.05), Luxembourg (-0.046), Belgium (-0.03), the Netherlands (-0.029),
and Switzerland (-0.027). Ranking the countries according to their losses is broadly but not
fully in line with estimated base probabilities. For example, in terms of its base probability,
Canada is estimated as the country with the 15th highest one. At the same time, the loss in
probability mass associated with the hypothetical US policy is ­0.0165463 and this implies
rank 11. Given our estimation approach, this is consistent with what we would expect in
context of policy spillovers: They are more likely to occur when countries are close to each
other.

The second experiment is motivated by proposals to coordinate equity requirements and
regulation. For this we simulate a coordinated policy action and set RATIO equal to 0.13
(13% equity requirement is the new target ratio agreed on in Basel III for the year 2019). This
experiment produces winners and losers. The losses (in parenthesis) of such a coordinated
policy are often significant: Luxembourg (-0.017), Great Britain (-0.014), USA (-0.007),
France (-0.006), Ireland (-0.006), Switzerland (-0.005). However, there are also winners. The
countries benefiting most are Russia (+0.025), Brazil (+0.007), Bulgaria (+0.006), Turkey
(+0.0057) and India (+0.0046). Figure 4 displays the distribution of gains and losses, with
Luxembourg and Great Britain at the very left of the gain-and-loss distribution and Russia at
the very right.

6. Conclusion
We have analyzed how the location of financial sector FDI is affected by taxes and the
regulatory environment. For the empirical analysis, we have considered novel data, covering
the universe of German outbound financial sector FDI over a time span of 13 years. Our
results suggest that not only regulation but also tax incentives matter for the location of
financial sector FDI.

Our empirical approach also computes cross-elasticities for tax incentives and regulation. We
find that a change in tax and regulation policy of one country affects the location probabilities
of other countries. Another important finding of our analysis is that own- as well as cross-
elasticities are estimated to be highly heterogeneous across firms and countries. For example,
expressed in elasticities, we find that US financial sector FDI is less responsive to tax and
regulation policy compared to financial sector FDI in countries like Singapore or Hong Kong.
Our findings have interesting policy implications. First, given that recent discussions in the
context of financial sector FDI often focus on regulation policy, our results suggest that
policymakers may place more emphasis on tax policy. Second, our findings confirm the
expectation that the responsiveness to tax and regulation policies varies across host countries.
Third, the result of significant externalities arising from uncoordinated policies implies that
coordinated action, particularly in regulation policy, is needed.
