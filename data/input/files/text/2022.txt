Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of total, chocolate, or sugar candy
consumption on intakes of total energy, fat, and added sugars; diet quality; weight/adiposity parameters; and
risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children 2Á13 years of age (n07,049) and adolescents 14Á18 years
(n04,132) participating in the 1999Á2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Methods: Twenty-four hour dietary recalls were used to determine intake. Diet quality was determined using
the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005). Covariate-adjusted means, standard errors, and prevalence rates
were determined for each candy consumption group. Odds ratios were used to determine the likelihood of
associations with weight status and diet quality.
Results: In younger children, total, chocolate, and sugar candy consumption was 11.4 g91.61, 4.8 g90.35,
and 6.6 g90.46, respectively. In adolescents, total, chocolate, and sugar candy consumption was 13.0 g90.87,
7.0 g90.56, and 5.9 g90.56, respectively. Total candy consumers had higher intakes of total energy (2248.9
kcals926.8 vs 1993.1 kcals915.1, pB0.0001) and added sugars (27.7 g90.44 vs 23.4 g90.38, pB0.0001)
than non-consumers. Mean HEI-2005 score was not different in total candy and sugar candy consumers as
compared to non-consumers, but was significantly lower in chocolate candy consumers (46.790.8 vs 48.39
0.4, p00.0337). Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, percentiles/z-score for weight-for-age
and BMI-for-age were lower for candy consumers as compared to non-consumers. Candy consumers were 22
and 26%, respectively, less likely to be overweight and obese than non-candy consumers. Blood pressure,
blood lipid levels, and cardiovascular risk factors were not different between total, chocolate, and sugar candy
consumers and non-consumers (except that sugar candy consumers had lower C-reactive protein levels than
non-consumers).
Conclusion: This study suggests that candy consumption did not adversely affect health risk markers in
children and adolescents.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity in pedia-
tric populations remains high; in 2007Á2008,
16.9% of children were obese (Body Mass Index
[BMI]-for-age percentile ]95) and 31.7% of children
were overweight (BMI-for-age percentile ]85 to B95)
(1). No statistically significant linear trends in high BMI
were found over the time periods 1999Á2000, 2001Á2002,
2003Á2004, 2005Á2006, and 2007Á2008 except among the
heaviest males 6Á19 years of age. Current cutoffs for BMI
in children can be used as an indication of adiposity (2).
Obesity in children increases the risk of diseases
previously seen mostly in adults, including hyperlipidemia

(3), hypertension (3), metabolic syndrome (4), and type 2
diabetes (4). Overweight children also suffer from dimin-
ished health-related quality of life (5), bullying/teasing (6),
and low self-esteem (7). Body mass index and waist
circumference (WC) can also identify children and
adolescents with a clustering of cardiovascular risk
factors (8). Although studies are contradictory, over-
weight in children may serve as a harbinger of adult
disease (9). Overweight/obesity in childhood tracks into
adulthood (10). Thus, it is important to understand the
factors associated with pediatric obesity.
One factor that may contribute to excess energy intake
is the consumption of discretionary calories (11, 12). The
2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) included
a recommendation for discretionary calories that were
defined as the difference between energy requirements
and essential energy needed to meet recommended
intakes (13). The concept of discretionary calories was
translated into MyPyramid recommendations for con-
sumers (14). The maximum number of discretionary
calories recommended ranges from 100 to 300 kcals
depending on age, gender, and physical activity level. The
Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI) (15), which measures
diet quality and adherence to the 2005 DGA, also
includes discretionary calories. Solid fats, alcohol, and
added sugars (AS) are major sources of discretionary
calories. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Commit-
tee, however, suggested moving away from the concept of
discretionary calories (16). Regardless, candy is a food
source of calories.
Intake of candy in US children is not well defined.
Bachman et al. (17), did not provide the absolute intake
of candy but showed using data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001Á
2002 that candy was the fifth highest contributor of AS
to the diet (6.2% of total AS) and was the sixth highest
contributor of oils (4.6% of total oils). In 2008, per capita
domestic disappearance of all candy/confectionery
products was 21.7 pounds (18). Per capita food avail-
ability data do not account for waste in the marketing
system or the home; thus, data typically overestimate
actual consumption. Candy has been shown to be the
second most frequently purchased category of items
(21.3% of all items) by children from `corner stores'
(19). It has also been shown that the percentage of
children consuming candy fell from 94% in 1973 to 71%
in 1994, and that in that time, the gram amount of candy
consumed fell from 45 g to approximately 35 g (20).
Candy consumption has been associated with dental
caries in children (21, 22), although caries development is
dependent on factors other than just fermentable carbo-
hydrate substrate in the mouth. These include oral
hygiene, dental care, and fluoride use (23, 24). The effect
of candy on weight and other health indicators is not well
established, although it is intuitive that candy consump-
tion would be positively associated with weight. Con-
sumption of `sweets,' including, but not limited to candy,
has been shown to be positively associated with weight
(25) in children. In contrast, candy intake was inversely
associated with weight in a longitudinal study of Swedish
children (26). The goal of this study was to examine
further the association between intake of candy and
weight/adiposity, diet quality, and health risk indicators
using a nationally representative sample of children.
Subjects and methods
Study population
Data from children and adolescents 2Á18 years of age
(n011,182) participating in the NHANES 1999Á2000,
2001Á2002, and 2003Á2004 were combined for these
analyses to increase sample size. Groups excluded from
the analyses were females who were pregnant and/or
lactating (n091), and those with 24-hour recall data
judged to be incomplete or unreliable by the USDA's
Food Surveys Research Group. This study was exempted
by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center's
Institutional Review Board.
Collection of dietary intake data
Dietary intake data were obtained from in-person 24-
hour dietary recall interviews administered using an
automated multiple-pass method (27, 28). Parents/guar-
dians of children 2Á5 years provided the 24-hour dietary
recalls; children (6Á11 years) were assisted by an adult;
and all others provided their own recall. For data
collection years 1999Á2002, only a single 24-hour dietary
recall was collected. Beginning in 2003Á2004, two 24-hour
dietary recalls were collected; however, to ensure consis-
tency within this study only data from the in-person
interview (first recall) were used. Descriptions of the
dietary interview methods are provided in the NHANES
Dietary Interviewer's Training Manual; these include
pictures of the Computer-Assisted Dietary Interview
system screens, measurement guides, and charts that
were used to collect dietary information (29).
Candy consumption and nutrient intake data
The survey food codes in USDA 1994Á1998 Survey
Nutrient Database (30) and the Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), Versions 1.0
(31) and 2.0 (32) were used in NHANES 1999Á2002 and
2003Á2004, respectively, to determine intake of candy.
Candy consumers were defined as those participants
consuming any amounts of candy/confection except
gum and were placed in one of three consumption
groups: (a) any candy/confection (chocolate candy, sugar
candy), (b) chocolate candy only, and (c) sugar candy

only. To assess intake of energy, total fat, saturated fatty
acids (SFA), and AS, the Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies, versions 1 (31) and 2 (32) were used
in NHANES, 2001Á2002 and 2003Á2004, respectively.
The USDA 1994Á1998 Survey Nutrient Database was
used to process the dietary interview data in NHANES
1999Á2000 (30).
The healthy eating index (HEI-2005)
The HEI-2005 was used to determine diet quality (15, 33,
34). The SAS code used to calculate HEI-2005 scores was
downloaded from the Center for Nutrition Policy and
Promotion website (35).
Physiologic measures
Height and weight were obtained according to NHANES
protocols (36). Body Mass Index was calculated as body
weight (kilogram) divided by height (meters) squared. The
percentile and z-score of BMI-for-age was calculated using
the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) program for
Growth Charts available from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) (37). Overweight was
defined as a gender-and-specific BMI between the 85th
and B95th percentile and obese was defined as a BMI ]
95th percentile (38). Several measures of weight and
adiposity were used in this study to look at the reliability
in the results. The measures included BMI, BMI-percentile
of weight for age, BMI-percentile of BMI for age, BMI
z-score of BMI for age, z-score of weight for age, and
triceps skinfolds.
Waist circumference (36), blood pressure (39), labora-
tory values of serum lipids (40), and other cardiovascular
risk factors were determined according to NHANES
protocols.
Statistical analysis
Sample-weighted data were used and all analyses were
performed using SAS and SUDAAN Release 9.0.1
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) to adjust the variance for the complex sample
design. For the years 1999Á2004, a 6-year weight variable
was created by assigning two-thirds of the 4-year weight
for 1999Á2002 if the person was sampled in 1999Á2002
and assigning one-third of the 2-year weight for 2003Á
2004 if the person was sampled in 2003Á2004. The 6-year
sample weights were used in analyses of intake, body
measurements, blood pressure, and laboratory data.
Analyses of health parameters were adjusted for
gender, ethnicity, age, and other relevant covariates (see
footnote in tables for specifics). For certain analyses, self-
reported exercise levels were used as a covariate; when
inclusion of exercise in the regression models reduced the
significance of the relationship of candy consumption
with dependent variables of interest, the relationship was
considered attenuated. Logistic regression was used to
assess the risk of lower HEI-2005 scores, overweight, and
obesity for candy consumers and non-consumers. Data
are presented as means9standard errors, and a p-value
of B0.05 was deemed significant. To further evaluate the
association of candy intake with food/nutrient intake and
health, we used methods of Huang et al. (41) to
determine implausible energy intakes and certain ana-
lyses were re-run to assess the impact of eliminating
subjects with energy intakes too high or too low as related
to expected energy requirements.
Results
Demographics
Table 1 shows the demographics of the sample for child-
ren 2Á13 years (n07,049) and adolescents 14Á18 years
(n04,132). In children, a higher percentage of females
than males consumed total candy (p00.0024); there was
also a race/ethnicity difference among total candy (p0
0.0064), chocolate candy (p00.0125), and sugar candy
(p00.0001) consumers compared with non-consumers.
Chocolate candy consumers were also older (8.091.6 vs
7.690.05 years, p00.0222) than non-chocolate consu-
mers. In adolescents, a higher percentage of females than
males consumed total candy (p00.0007), chocolate candy
(0.0024), and sugar candy (p00.0234). There was a race/
ethnicity difference among total (pB0.0001), chocolate
(p00.0064), and sugar candy (p00.0001) consumers
when compared with non-consumers.
Candy consumption
In children 2Á13 years, the total (11.4 g91.61 vs 35.2 g9
1.4), chocolate (4.8 g90.35 vs 35.8 g91.7), and sugar
(6.6 g90.46 vs 29.0 g91.3) candy consumption for the
total population and candy consumers only, respectively
(Table 2). In adolescents, per capita and candy consumer
intake was 13.0 g90.87 vs 46.2 g91.4, 7.0 g90.56 vs
48.4 g92.0, and 5.9 g90.56 vs 36.1 g93.2 for total
candy, chocolate candy, and sugar candy, respectively
(Table 2).
Nutrient intake and HEI-2005 scores
Total candy consumers had higher intakes of energy
(2248.9 kcals926.8 vs 1993.1 kcals915.1, pB0.0001)
and AS (27.790.44 vs 23.490.38, pB0.0001) than non-
consumers (Table 3). Chocolate candy consumers had
higher intakes of energy (2333.8 kcals952.2 vs 2031.2
kcals913.3, pB0.0001), total fat (79.0 g90.85 vs 75.2
g90.40, p00.0001), SFA (28.8 g90.37 vs 26.5 g90.16,
pB0.0001), and AS (27.7 g90.71 vs 24.3 g924.390.34,
pB0.0001) than non-consumers. Sugar candy consumers
had higher intakes of energy (2254.3929.4 vs 2024.49
13.4, pB0.0001) and AS (28.490.51 vs 23.890.34,

76.490.43, pB0.0001) and SFA (25.690.28 vs 27.19
0.17, pB0.0001) than non-consumers.
Mean HEI-2005 score was not different in total candy
or sugar candy consumers as compared to non-consumers.
However, the mean HEI-2005 score was significantly
lower in chocolate candy consumers as compared to
non-consumers (46.790.8 vs 48.390.4, p00.0337) (Table
3). Results using reduced data set eliminating implausible
intake provided similar results to those above.
Anthropometrics, blood pressure, and laboratory values
Mean adjusted levels of adiposity measures by candy
consumption category are presented in Table 4. Total
candy consumers had a significantly lower weight (42.1 kg9
0.32 vs 43.5 kg90.27; p00.0001), BMI (19.590.12 vs
20.190.10; pB0.0001), WC (67.7 cm90.35 vs 68.9 cm9
0.28; p00.0001), triceps skinfolds (13.6 mm90.25 vs
14.0 mm90.13; p00.0334), percentiles/z-scores for
weight-for-age (59.190.71 vs 63.590.77, 0.3590.03 vs
0.5190.03, respectively; both pB0.0001), and percen-
tiles/z-scores for BMI-for-age (57.890.92 vs 62.790.76,
0.2890.03 vs 0.4790.03; both pB0.0001) than non-
consumers. Weight, BMI, and WC analyses were re-run
adjusting for self-reported moderate/vigorous or vigorous
physical activity and this did not change the results (data
not shown). Chocolate candy consumers had a lower
weight (41.9 kg90.46 vs 43.3 kg90.27, p00.0147),
shorter stature (140.1 cm90.29 vs 141.0 cm90.17, p0
0.0295, lower WC (67.8 cm90.42 vs 68.6 cm90.29, p0
0.0448), and lower percentile BMI-for-age (58.991.3 vs
61.690.79, p00.0352) than non-consumers. Sugar candy
consumers had a lower weight (41.9 kg90.39 vs 43.4
kg90.25, p00.0004), BMI (19.590.13 vs 20.190.10,
pB0.0001), WC (67.6 cm90.38 vs 68.8 cm90.27, p0
0.0004), triceps skinfold (13.5 mm90.28 vs 14.0 mm9
0.14, p00.0356), and percentile/z-score for BMI-for-age
(58.791.3 vs 62.890.99, p00.0167; 0.3190.05 vs 0.489
0.03, p00.0164, respectively) than non-consumers.
There were no differences in children regarding the
likelihood to have a high quality diet, defined by HEI
(80th percentile or better), among all three groups of
candy consumers and non-consumers (Table 5). Using
CDC growth charts to assess weight status, candy
consumers were 22% less likely (pB0.0001) to be over-
weight and 26% less likely to be obese (pB0.0001) than
non-consumers (Table 5). Sugar candy consumers were
21% less likely (p00.0015) to be overweight and 20% less
likely to be obese (p00.0150) than non-consumers.
The only physiologic parameter that was different was
a lower C-reactive protein level of sugar candy consumers
and non-consumers (0.12 mg/dL90.01 vs 0.15 mg/dL9
0.01, p00.0085) (Table 6).
Discussion
These data showed that nearly 32% of children and 30%
of adolescents reported consuming candy the day of the
recall. These figures are much lower than those shown in
the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) (20) potentially showing
that candy consumption decreased from 1993Á1994 to
1999Á2004. That study, which also used 24-hour diet
recall methodology, showed that in 1973Á1974, 94% of
10-year-old children consumed candy and in 1993Á1994,
71% of 10-year-old children consumed candy. In that
study, the diets of children of one age only were
examined, a limited geographic range was examined,
and participants were limited to black/white. Although
we were unable to find a study examining geographic
differences in candy intake in children, a recent study of
adults showed that energy intake from candy was higher
in Southeast Louisiana than in Los Angeles County (12).
Additional studies assessing geographic variation in
candy consumption are needed.
Consumption of candy in this study was modest. There
are few studies with which to compare these results. For
the BHS study, Nicklas et al. (20) showed that in 1973Á
1974, intake in 10-year-old children was 45.0 g and in
1993Á1994, intake was 34.8 g; however, it was not clear if
this was per capita consumption or reflected the intake of
consumers only. Dietary data were obtained using 24-
hour recalls; although the multiple pass method used in
NHANES provides more accurate data than other recall
methods (27, 28), over- and under-reporting may still
occur. Individuals may selectively under-report foods
generally known to be high in fats, carbohydrates, and
sugars (42). Foods with a `negative health image' may be

subject to higher levels of under-reporting than other
foods (43). Since candy is a food potentially influenced by
reporting errors, individuals with implausible intakes (41)
were excluded from the data set and the reported
relationships remained.
This study showed that in total, chocolate, and sugar
candy consumers, total energy intake was higher when
compared with non-consumers. Using nationally repre-
sentative data sets, from 1977 to 2006, energy from candy
consumed as snacks by children increased from 5.7 to
8.5%, although values were modest when compared with
other snack foods such as desserts and sweetened
beverages (44). Despite the higher intake of energy by
candy consumers, consumption was not associated with
higher levels of any weight parameter, but was associated
with a lower risk of overweight and obesity. Future
studies should include assessment of overall dietary and
physical activity patterns of candy consumers, but long-
itudinal studies are needed to understand more fully the
relationship between higher energy intake and its associa-
tion with weight in candy consumers.
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that the
population consume no more than 25% of energy from
AS (45). Overall, candy consumers also had higher
intakes of AS than non-consumers; however, mean
energy from AS in consumers of total, chocolate, and
sugar candy was only 4.9%, 4.7%, and 6.3%, respectively.
Candy contributed very low levels of AS to the diet.
The IOM recommendation for AS was based, in part,
on the finding that AS in excess of 25% showed the
greatest decline in micronutrient dilution (45). The
majority of studies have suggested that consumption of
foods high in AS were associated with poor overall diet
quality (46Á50), whereas two reviews have failed to
provide conclusive evidence that AS affects diet quality
(51, 52). Overall, diet quality in this study was very poor
in all groups, whether or not candy was consumed. Diet
quality was lower only in chocolate candy consumers.
This may be because of the increased intake of SFA, a
component in calculating the HEI-2005 (15), in chocolate
candy consumers. That SFA intake was higher in
chocolate candy consumers was not surprising since
SFA are found in higher proportions than unsaturated
fatty acids in cocoa butter. Cacao seeds contain a
significant amount of fat (40Á50% as cocoa butter) (53),
but the fat content of chocolate candy is influenced not
only by the percentage of cacao solids but by addition of
other ingredients, e.g. milk or cream (54).
The higher SFA intake may also be of concern from
a standpoint of changes in serum lipid levels or other
biomarkers of cardiovascular disease; however, recent
evidence has questioned the role of SFA as a risk factor in
heart disease (55). Children are less likely than adults to
have lipid derangements; however, with the increasing
levels of overweight and obesity in children, lipid levels

Effects of candy consumption in children

and other cardiovascular risk factors have become of
concern in pediatric populations (56). Palmitic and
stearic acids constitute the main types of SFA (57) in
cocoa butter. Stearic acid is unique among saturated fats
in that it is not associated with the low density lipoprotein
cholesterol raising potential of other SFA (58, 59). Diet
can influence lipid levels in children (60), so it would not
have been surprising to find that consumption of
chocolate candy modified lipid levels in children. How-
ever, unlike studies with adults that have shown that
chocolate consumption may improve lipid profiles
(61Á63), no differences were seen in any lipid markers.
These findings may have resulted from the relatively small
sample size for chocolate consumers or the type of
chocolate consumed, since dark chocolate with a high
cacao content or cocoa is associated with the greatest
improvement in lipids (64, 65).
Limitations
NHANES is a cross-sectional study; thus, cause and
effect associations cannot be drawn. Twenty-four hour
dietary recalls have several inherent limitations. They may
not reflect usual intake and they depend on memory.
Parents/guardians reported or assisted with the 24-hour
recalls of children 2Á11 years of age; whereas parents
often report accurately what children eat at home, (66)
but may not know what their children eat outside the
home (67) that could result in reporting errors (68). In
children and adolescents, a greater degree of under-
reporting has been shown as relative adiposity increased
(69, 70), which may have accounted for the results. To
help obviate this potential problem, implausible energy
intakes were deleted from the data set (41). Finally,
chocolate candies were combined into a single group;
thus, potential effects of dark chocolate could not be
assessed.
Conclusions
This study showed that approximately one-third of
children and adolescents consumed candy the day of
the recall and that candy consumption was associated
with higher intakes of energy and added sugars; choco-
late candy consumption was also associated with higher
total and SFA intake. Total, chocolate, and sugar candy
consumption was not associated with weight/adiposity
variables and candy consumers were less likely to be
overweight or obese than non-candy consumers. Only
chocolate candy consumers had a lower diet quality than
non-consumers, but all individuals had poor diet quality
regardless of whether they consumed candy. Current
levels of candy consumption were not associated with
adverse health parameters in children or adolescents.
