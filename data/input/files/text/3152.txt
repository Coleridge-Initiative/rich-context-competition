Introduction
Social movement scholars have long considered organiza-
tions vital to the success of movements (Cress & Snow,
1996;Jenkins&Eckert,1986;Klandermans,1984;McCarthy
& Zald, 1977; Taylor, 1989). Resource mobilization theory
put organizations devoted to social change advocacy--social
movement organizations (SMOs)--at the very center of the
study of social movements (Clemens & Minkoff, 2004;
McCarthy & Zald, 1977), arguing that they fulfill important
roles in the mobilization process. SMOs organize events,
provide opportunities to protest (e.g., rally, sign petitions;
Klandermans, 2004), work to connect people to these oppor-
tunities to protest, and recruit participants and new members
(Klandermans & Oegema, 1987). SMOs also facilitate conti-
nuity for movements, recruiting new members as old ones
leave, ensuring the movement continues on after the first
generation of activists (Taylor, 1989; Whittier, 1997).1
However, in research on youth activism, the role and
importance of SMOs is somewhat different. While acknowl-
edging the importance of SMOs generally to movements
and finding that SMOs can help young people become polit-
ically socialized and active (Conner, 2011; Delgado &
Staples, 2007; Kirshner, 2008), researchers interested in
youth activism also find that SMOs are often adult-domi-
nated (O'Donoghue & Strobel, 2007) and tend to minimize
the leadership and participation available to youth (Taft,
2014). Moreover, the level of youth mobilization varies
from movement to movement, with movements like immi-
gration, feminist, and LGBT rights experiencing a surge in
recent years, though there is often tension between youth
and adult leaders within the movement (Ghaziani, 2011;
Hunt, 2017; Miceli, 2005; Nichols, 2013; Terriquez, 2015;
Whittier, 2017). Indeed, as a recent review of work on youth
activism suggests (Earl, Maher, & Elliott, 2017), SMOs
have historically had a fraught relationship with youth that
sometimes leads youth to form their own organizations or to
participate outside of organizations.

Organizing the Next Generation: Youth
Engagement with Activism Inside and
Outside of Organizations
Thomas Elliott1 and Jennifer Earl2
Abstract
Social movement scholars have long considered organizations (social movement organizations [SMOs]) vital to the success of
a movement. SMOs organize events, mobilize participants, and recruit new activists into the movement. In the case of youth
activism, SMOs can also play a vital role in the political socialization of youth. However, a substantial line of research finds that
most SMOs do a poor job of encouraging and facilitating youth engagement in offline, face-to-face contexts. With the growing
use of digital media by both social movements and youth, online activism presents another avenue through which SMOs
can recruit youth participation. The extent to which SMOs are doing any better at this online than offline is an open and
surprisingly new question, however. Using a unique dataset, we explore the extent to which SMOs are encouraging youth
participation in social movement activity online. Based on our findings, we argue that engaging with and recruiting youth into
SMOs is vital for the future health of these organizations as well as the political socialization of youth, and that SMOs are not
doing enough to recruit youth online, mirroring their failure offline.

2 Social Media + Society
This literature on youth activism in SMOs has been heav-
ily focused on face-to-face interactions, even though other
literatures, such as scholarship on youth civic engagement
has taken a substantial digital turn (Earl et al., 2017).
Moreover, this focus on face-to-face interactions exists
despite wide scale use of digital technologies by youth
(Palfrey & Gasser, 2013) and in protest (Brunsting & Postmes,
2002; van Laer & van Aelst, 2010). In this article, we bring
questions about youth engagement in SMOs into the digital
world by investigating one way that SMOs may attempt to
recruit and connect with youth--through their web pres-
ences--to determine if the relationship between SMOs and
youth online seems as troubled as it has been offline. Referred
to as the "supply side" of protest (Klandermans, 2004), mate-
rials, framings, and opportunities made available by SMOs
online allow researchers into SMOs' unmediated presenta-
tions of priorities and concerns for recruiting and representa-
tions. These data provide an unvarnished look into how youth
mobilization is positioned in SMO-made material.
Specifically, we use unique empirical data to examine the
extent to which web-addressable spaces run by SMOs reach
out to youth on a variety of levels, from having content that is
directly relevant to youth to hosting youth sections on web-
sites or inviting youth participation in protest actions, among
other potential connections. Our novel dataset consists of data
from quantitatively content coding a random sample of
addressable digital spaces (e.g., websites, public Facebook
pages, blogs) engaged in advocacy across each of 20 different
issue areas. Given that SMOs are not doing a good job engag-
ing youth offline, we expect that SMOs are likely also doing a
poor job of engaging youth through their web presences.
Our data confirm this expectation, but skeptics may be
tempted to defend SMOs by arguing that SMOs fail to try to
connect with youth because youth are disinterested and thus
web presences simply reflect the lack of demand youth have
for engagement. To address this likely criticism, we also
assess the extent to which youth are becoming involved polit-
ically online, including in protest, and the extent to which
youth involvement with SMOs increases their engagement. If
we find low levels of youth engagement, or little impact of
connecting with SMOs on youth, then it is possible that critics
are correct and SMOs fail to try to connect with youth online
because they know youth are disinterested and/or connecting
with youth doesn't change their engagement. Instead, though,
we find that such pessimism about youth is incorrect: using
national survey data, we show that youth are actually quite
active in protest online, despite a lack of, rather than because
of, substantial outreach and that when youth are involved
with SMOs, they are more active than other youth.
The Historical Role of SMOs in
Movements
Organizations have taken center stage in social movement
research since McCarthy and Zald (1977) developed resource
mobilization theory. SMOs are seen as the primary vehicle
through which resources are collected, organized, and then
directed toward advocacy (Cress & Snow, 1996; McCarthy
& Zald, 1977). In fact, social movement research has come
to consider SMOs as the primary actors in social movements
(Clemens & Minkoff, 2004), with even other major theories
acknowledging their importance. Political opportunity the-
ory, for instance, often considers organizational formation
when analyzing the emergence of political opportunities
(Meyer & Minkoff, 2004). The literature on framing expects
SMOs to strategically construct and realign collective action
frames (Snow, Rochford, Worden & Benford, 1986). SMOs
also facilitate the creation and maintenance of collective
identity (Polletta & Jasper, 2001).
For movements, a diversity of SMOs allow for a diversity
of ideology, strategy, tactics, and organizational forms within
the same movement (Clemens & Minkoff, 2004), allowing
these differences to attract more members to the movement
overall as individuals find organizations that fit them well.
This diversity also allows for a division of labor among orga-
nizations (Gamson & Wolfsfeld, 1993) and useful collabora-
tions. More generally, SMOs ensure continuity of both
themselves and the larger movement (Whittier, 1997). They
recruit new members as older ones leave, often targeting
young people for new memberships (Hirsch, 1990) and serve
as abeyance structures when movements enter periods of low
activity or hostile contexts (Taylor, 1989). Even Earl, who
has argued that "organizing outside of organizations" (Karpf,
2012) online can be fruitful (Earl & Kimport, 2011),
acknowledges that having some SMOs in a larger movement
ecology is likely important for the health and vitality of large,
enduring movements (Earl, 2015).
Certainly, one of the most important roles SMOs occupy
is the primary supplier of opportunities to engage in protest
and advocacy. SMOs use their resources to plan events
designed to further their goals. In planning these events,
SMOs decide what kinds of tactics to use and the frames they
will use to justify the actions. Tactical and framing decisions
also often contain indicators of who expected participants
will be, since tactics, frames, and participants need to align
for successful motivation.
As mentioned above, Klandermans (2004) argues this
event planning constitutes the "supply side" of protest, a
critical component of the supply and demand nexus neces-
sary for mobilization. Beyond providing a supply of opportu-
nities, SMOs are also instrumental in mobilizing because
they target potential participants in collective action, invite
them to join (Klandermans & Oegema, 1987), and incentiv-
ize participation by providing selective incentives and other
rewards, particularly for risky or difficult protest
(Klandermans, 1984). Indeed, the first step in this multi-step
mobilization process--being directly asked to participate in
a protest--is one of the best predictors of participation
(Schussman & Soule, 2005). Aside from being asked, it
should not be surprising that two of the other best predictors
Elliott and Earl 3
of activism are network and/or organizational connections to
a movement (Gould, 1991; Klandermans, 2004; McAdam,
1988; Schussman & Soule, 2005; Tindall, 2004). SMOs also
help to maintain participation across time by facilitating col-
lective identity, which strengthens the member's commit-
ment to the movement (Polletta & Jasper, 2001), and by
embedding members in a network of personal relationships
that promote future participation (Tindall, 2004). Given this,
we argue that how SMOs create the "supply side" of protest
is consequential and likely, based on prevailing social move-
ment scholarship, to effect who is mobilized for what ends.
SMO web-based presences, such as SMO websites, publicly
accessible Facebook pages and twitter feeds, and other pub-
licly accessible SMO-controlled material give researchers
access to this "supply side" as it exists online. While we do
not claim that web presences provide an exhaustive portrait
of how SMOs engage different audiences through the mani-
fold opportunities for connection online, web presences rep-
resent a privileged site of inquiry because they embody the
unmediated self-presentation of the organization and move-
ment to others, representing their key concerns and constitu-
encies and also courting connection and mobilization from
some kinds of site visitors.
Youth Mobilization and SMOs
SMOs are also important to youth because they can provide
spaces for political socialization. SMOs provide opportuni-
ties for youth to engage in politics, and youth see political
activism modeled by adult members. These opportunities
can help youth develop important problem solving and inter-
personal skills, and help youth develop political identities
(Conner, 2011; Delgado & Staples, 2007; Kirshner, 2008).
This is not to suggest that SMOs are in control of youths'
socialization process. Recent research on political socializa-
tion argues that youth, in fact, socialize themselves, synthe-
sizing what they learn from family, friends, school, and other
contexts (Yates & Youniss, 1999; Youniss et al., 2002). But,
SMOs can provide important avenues for experiences that
contribute to socialization. Moreover, when SMOs create
egalitarian relationships between youth and adults
(O'Donoghue & Strobel, 2007), youth often continue to par-
ticipate, which can beget participation well into adulthood.
However, research shows that SMOs have failed to prop-
erly cultivate youth engagement in recent years (Gordon,
2007; Khalil, 2012; O'Donoghue & Strobel, 2007; Taft &
Gordon, 2013). SMOs are doing a poor job of recruiting
youth offline into traditional protest (Gordon, 2007;
O'Donoghue & Strobel, 2007). Instead, many youth, wanting
to engage in political and civic life within their community,
are turning to community-based youth organizations, which
facilitate the development of egalitarian relationships between
youth and adult leaders (O'Donoghue & Strobel, 2007).
When youth do get engaged in SMOs offline, SMOs tend to
either provide adult-led participation opportunities that leave
little room for youth to feel empowered (Taft & Gordon,
2013), or they engage in ageist dismissal of youths' ability to
fully participate (Taft, 2014). Youth have responded by opting
out of traditional SMOs. Some youth have created their own,
youth-led organizations (Gordon, 2007) in which adults either
play peripheral roles or are excluded altogether.
This trend appears to be true even in movements that have
seen an increase in youth mobilization in recent years. For
example, in the mid-2000s, the immigration reform move-
ment encouraged the participation of undocumented youth,
termed DREAMers after the proposed DREAM Act that
would offer people who entered the country as young chil-
dren a path to citizenship. However, growing tension between
the priorities of the adult leaders of the movement and the
DREAMers led to a rift, and many undocumented youth
building their own movement for immigration reform
(Nichols, 2013). Likewise, young women on college cam-
puses have mobilized in response to a lack of action by col-
lege administrators of adequately address instances of sexual
assault (Whittier, 2017). Youth mobilization has been impor-
tant for the LGBT movement for several decades now, par-
ticularly work done within gay straight alliances (Miceli,
2005). However, recent research suggests that young LGBT
students are diverging in their identities and politics from
previous LGBT generations (Ghaziani, 2011). This evidence
suggests that while some movements do a better job of
attracting youth activists, few are successfully integrating
them into traditional SMO spaces.
Taking this work together, it is clear that SMOs play an
incredibly important role in the health and effectiveness of
social movements, but research has documented how SMOs
have failed to properly engage youth in offline protest. This
could be consequential for the future health and longevity of
social movements if they fail to recruit a new generation of
activists into their SMOs. With the widespread adoption of
the Internet and digital media for political protest, SMOs are
faced with a new arena in which youth engagement is incred-
ibly important. Thus, we argue that it is important to under-
stand how digital spaces run by SMOs (vs spaces not run by
SMOs) attempt to connect with youth.
Our central question is whether SMOs have attempted to
reach out to youth through their online presences, inviting
youth to participate and creating inviting spaces for them. On
the one hand, this is a straightforward question about how
often SMOs explicitly attempt to connect with young people
through their online content, by creating explicit spaces for
them, or by inviting engagement directly. On the other hand,
it is also a question of whether spaces are designed with fea-
tures that prior research shows appeal to youth. For instance,
existing research shows youth prefer websites that give them
opportunities for interactivity (Bachen, Raphael, Lynn,
McKee, & Philippi, 2008; Montgomery, 2001). However,
interactivity--which includes creating or remixing content
and posting it online as well interacting with other users
through message boards, forums, live chatting features, or
4 Social Media + Society
other means--may seem quite risky to professional SMOs
eager to control their message and image (Earl, 2013; Meyer
& Tarrow, 1998).
Data: SMOs and Youth
In order to understand the universe of online social move-
ment material that may be accessible by youth, and evaluate
the extent to which this material actively works to connect
with youth, we need to access population-level data on web-
addressable social movement spaces. Although we use a
method that can find any web-addressable digital space that
is publicly accessible (e.g., public Facebook pages, twitter
feeds, etc. as well as traditional websites), for ease of termi-
nology and to reflect that the vast majority of cases we study
are traditional websites, we refer to these web-addressable
spaces as websites from here forward. We also need to study
more than a single social movement to ensure that our find-
ings are not movement-specific; therefore, we collect and
examine data on publicly accessible websites active in 20
different issue areas.
But, studying a random sample of sites, or an entire popu-
lation, can be difficult. Identifying the population of advo-
cacy websites is impractical, and so traditional sampling
techniques are difficult to implement online. To overcome
these limitations, we rely on an important simplifying
assumption that makes this dilemma tractable: we assume
that our population is limited to those web-addressable
spaces on a topic that other users could reasonably identify
and visit. Thus, we are interested in the population of spaces
that potential users are at risk of finding, arguing that this
represents a methodologically tractable way to examine a
privileged site of organizational self-representation. While
we are unable to include the deep Web, our focus on the pop-
ulation of "reachable websites" (i.e., web-addressable spaces
we do not need the URL to be able to locate) does allow us to
sample the publicly available supply of online advocacy.
We use repeated searches on Google since: (1) Google is
the leading search engine and (2) Googlebot, which helps to
build Google's vast database, relies on link-crawling to
identify new sites, a process that mimics the way individuals
find websites and other addressable spaces. We select 20
social movement issue areas to represent those that are tra-
ditionally studied by social movement scholars (e.g., abor-
tion and civil rights), issue areas where mobilization has
increased or decreased significantly over time (e.g., immi-
gration and globalization), and issue areas tied to the Internet
(e.g., open source).
We expect each of these movements to be potentially
interesting to youth. The feminist, immigration, and lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) move-
ments have seen youth mobilization in recent years (Hunt,
2017; Terriquez, 2015). Movements around privacy and
open source are potentially interesting for preserving privacy
and freedom online, a space youth spend more time than
other age cohorts. Youth enjoy remixing and redistributing
pieces of culture they find online (Cohen, Kahne, Bowyer,
Middaugh, & Rogowski, 2012; Ito et al, 2009), which can
often run into issues of intellectual property. Youth have also
been subject to heighted surveillance on the part of parents
and schools online (Hope, 2005; Taylor, 2013).
We generate a list of search terms for each issue area, pre-
tested to ensure validity of results. These search terms are
designed to capture both the pro- and anti-side of the issue, so
the abortion issue area includes search terms to identify both
pro-life and pro-choice websites. To identity search terms, we
first use common keywords in academic and popular litera-
tures, for example, "free speech" for the civil liberties issue.
We buttress these keywords with additional common terms
drawn from exemplar websites for each issue area (e.g., NOW
for the feminist issue area). From both sources, we pair terms
with an action word, such as "protest" or "stop," and verify
these search terms return quality results from Google, gener-
ating 175 search terms across the 20 issues.
We use each search term as a query to a Google API that
allows us to retrieve up to 1000 results per query. The results
from all queries for the same issue area are combined to gener-
ate 20 independent populations of reachable websites for each
issue area, in total representing over one hundred thousand
unique URLs (for more details on an earlier wave of data col-
lection, see Earl, Kimport, Prieto, Rush, & Reynoso, 2010). It
is important to note that by using repetitive searches and all
1,000 results per search we avoid impacts of Google's Page
Rank on our method. Research does show that website owners
try to game Page Rank to get on the first page of results, but
there is no evidence that website owners game to be in the top
1,000. Moreover, an examination of results after the top-1,000
showed very poor quality returns that were irrelevant to our
searches. By including all results and randomly sampling,
which disregards order within the top-1,000, we avoid these
problems.
We identified populations of reachable websites for 20
issue areas in August, 2010. We then drew a 1% random sam-
ple by cause, made a local archive of the sites as they appeared
in 2010, and then quantitatively content coded them. Any pro-
tests linked to or hosted by one of these sites (save sampling
completed for a few massive sites) were also separately coded.
We coded 1,084 websites and 3,659 protest actions.
Our method of identifying websites yielded many that had
content relevant to social movements, but did not engage in
advocacy. For example, news sites, like pbs.org and rocky-
mountainnews.com, online copies of books stored on Google
Books, Wikipedia articles, and university websites were
coded as containing material about a movement issue area,
but containing no appeals for change. To focus on advocacy
websites, we drop these websites that did not make appeals
for change or advocacy. We also drop sites that did not advo-
cate for change on the issue for which they were sampled
(e.g., websites sampled on the abortion movement issue but
did not engage in any abortion advocacy). This substantially
Elliott and Earl 5
reduces our dataset: our final sample includes 363 websites
and the 1402 protest actions that were hosted on or linked
from those 363 websites.
Coding
Coding proceeded in two waves. The first wave, taking place
in 2010­2011, coded for 93 measures of activism on the
websites and another 46 measures about every protest action
hosted or linked to from those sites (e.g., online petitions
users could sign; in person demonstrations users were invited
to attend). The second wave, coding in 2013­2014, coded an
additional 28 website measures and 7 additional protest
action measures. This second wave of coding used the same
archives of the websites as the first wave, to ensure the same
content was coded across the two waves. Inter-coder reliabil-
ity for the first wave is 98.2% for website level measures and
97.7% for protest action measures. Inter-coder reliability for
the second wave is 96.9% for website level measures and
99.1% for protest action measures.
We code for three different measures of youth orientation
of websites to capture the level of youth engagement. First,
we code a website for youth content. This measure assesses
whether the site contains material relevant to youth, whether
or not the material is intended for youth. This could include
sites that teach parents how to talk to their children about
bullying, or websites that teaches youth how to start a gay/
straight alliance at their school. Our second measure, youth
audience, assesses whether the website includes youth as
part of their target audience. This could be accomplished by
providing a separate space on the site intended specifically
for youth, or by explicitly including youth as part of their
broader audience. The third measure, youth participation,
captures whether websites explicitly invite or encourage
youth to participate in the protest events the sites host or link
to, through explicit references and invitations to youth. We
define protest activities as activities outside of normal insti-
tutional political channels that call for change, which includes
activities such as signing petitions, attending rallies, partici-
pating in sit-ins, or participating in boycotts. For all of the
above, we conceptualize youth as persons through college
age (approximately 24years old).2
Many advocacy sites are not run by formal SMOs, but
instead are developed and maintained by individuals or
informal networks (Earl, 2013). To identify which websites
are affiliated with a SMO and which ones are not, we code
whether the website was operated by a SMO or not; focused
less on the technical operations of the site (i.e., not on who is
responsible for the technical aspects of maintaining the site),
but rather whether an organization was responsible for the
content hosted on site. We define SMOs as formal organiza-
tions, with physical headquarters, whose primary mission is
to advocate for change on behalf of a constituency.
Organizations that only fund other organizations (i.e., foun-
dations) are not considered SMOs, unless they also engage in
advocacy themselves. We use this definition because it is
largely consistent with the existing literature, and we identi-
fied a number of sites that claimed to represent organizations
that were actually just single individuals trying to make their
cause seem larger. To exclude these kinds of sites from the
organizational coding, we required some sense of offline
presence. For instance, we code websites run by the ACLU
(http://www.aclunc.org), Amnesty International (amnesty.
org), and Americans for Prosperity (http://www.americans-
forprosperity.org) as SMO affiliated. Examples of websites
in our data that are not affiliated with a SMO include crook-
sandliars.com, change.org, and queerfilter.com.
We are also interested in how interactive websites feel and
how often they deploy features that have been discussed for
youth-specific website design. Drawing on insights from Earl
(2013), we code for website features that increase the partici-
patory nature of the website. We code for whether the site
allows users to get information about an issue, such as press
releases or research papers; whether the site allows users to
provide information to the site, such as uploading research or
news articles, or providing tip-lines that allow users to leave
information about companies with contested business prac-
tices. We also code for whether the website allows users to
share their opinions about an issue, or see others' opinions
hosted on the site. We code whether the websites contains
polls, quizzes, games, or crossword puzzles and also code for
whether the website contains features that allowed users to
chat with other users live (Bachen et al., 2008; Montgomery,
2001; Montgomery, Gottlieb-Robles, & Larson, 2004).
Findings: SMOs and Youth
The goal of our first analysis is to understand the extent to
which SMO-affiliated websites actively court youth through
their web presences. We do this by examining the overall
youth-orientations of the websites as well as specific feature
sets and site production practices. Across these analyses, we
find that social movement websites in general do a poor job
of targeting youth, mirroring what previous research has
found offline, although there is a small surprise: although
both SMO-affiliated and sites not run by SMOs all do poorly
in trying to connect with youth, in some cases, SMO-
affiliated websites do try to connect more with youth than
sites not run by SMOs.
Figure 1 graphs youth orientation based on youth content,
youth audience, and youth actions and shows that websites are
much more likely to host youth-relevant content than to treat
youth as an audience or explicitly court youth participation.
Although websites are more likely to have youth content than
other forms of youth orientation, it is still the case that a minor-
ity of websites have youth-relevant content. The other two
kinds of youth-oriented connections are far more infrequent.
To test whether the differences we see in the figure are signifi-
cant, we perform t-tests for a difference in proportion between
sites run by SMOs and those not run by SMOs.3 Across all
6 Social Media + Society
three categories of youth-orientation, SMO-run websites are
more likely to be youth oriented than non-SMO websites
(p
<
.05). For instance, almost half of all SMO-run websites
feature youth content, while less than a third of non-SMO
websites contain youth content. Over 20% of SMO-run web-
sites include youth in their targeted audience, while only 10%
of non-SMO websites target a youth audience. Five percent of
SMO-run websites explicitly invite youth to participate in
advocacy actions, while less than 1% of non-SMO websites
do so. In other words, sites in general do a poor job of trying to
connect with youth in these ways, but SMO-run sites do a
slightly better, although still lackluster, job at this.
As we previously discussed, youth mobilization varies
from movement to movement, and so it is important as a
check on our findings to assess whether patterns of youth-
directed orientations differ substantially across issue areas:
perhaps some movements are much better at connecting with
youth, but this is obscured by analyzing all issue areas
together. While there is no research available to support clear
hypotheses about how attempts at youth engagement by
SMOs might vary by issue area, examining this is an impor-
tant check against potentially overgeneralized findings.
To explore how these patterns differ, Figure 2 graphs the per-
centage of websites that feature youth content by SMO affilia-
tion and social movement issue area. The left panel shows issue
areas in which SMO-run websites contain youth content more
often than non-SMO websites. The panel on the right shows
issue areas in which non-SMO websites contain youth content
more often than SMO-run sites. Movements about homeless-
ness, labor, civil liberties, and LGBTQ rights top the list in
terms of SMO-run youth engagement, although labor and
LGBTQ non-SMO websites also engage youth at a high rate.
On the other hand, movements focused on peace, civil rights,
and poverty bottom out the list in terms of SMO-run youth
engagement, though even the non-SMO websites also do a rela-
tively poor job of youth engagement in these issue areas.
Interestingly, despite the high salience of DREAMers in the fall
of 2010, less than 50% of SMO-run websites in the immigration
issue area contain youth content, and less than a quarter of non-
SMO immigration websites contain youth content.
Figure 3 shows the breakdown of including youth in the
targeted audience of a website by SMO affiliation and issue
area. LGBTQ and labor again make the top of the list, as does
green and open source. For the latter two, no non-SMO web-
sites include youth in their intended audience. Homelessness,
which topped the list for youth content, has no websites that
include youth in their audience, indicating that while these
sites are very concerned about youth homelessness, the web-
sites do not speak to these youth, nor any youth, directly.
Human rights, intellectual property (IP) reform, nuclear, and
privacy also do not target a youth audience.

Issue Area.

Explicitly inviting youth to participate in advocacy
through a website shows similar patterns as the two other
measures of youth orientation.As shown in Figure 4, LGBTQ
and green top the list here, as they did for youth audience.
Interestingly, only labor contains non-SMO websites that
explicitly invite youth to participate in advocacy; all other
websites that invite youth to participate are SMO-run.
Overall, it appears that for some movements, such as
LGBTQ, green, and labor, SMOs are more likely than non-
SMO sites to try to engage youth in various ways, but this is
not true across all issue areas we examined. Future research
should try to understand these variations across causes.
Prior research has argued that youth are drawn to websites
that offer opportunities to interact with other users on the site,
as well as to create and post their own content (Bachen et al.,
2008; Montgomery, 2001). So, even if websites don't have
apparent overall youth orientations, perhaps they are interac-
tive and include features thought to be attractive to young
users. Figure 5 graphs how often SMO-run and non-SMO
websites provide these types of opportunities for users. While
SMO-run websites are more likely (p<.05) to provide oppor-
tunities for users to get information about an issue, non-SMO
websites are much more likely (p
<
.001) to allow users to
express their opinions on the website through message boards,
polls, or other features allowing users to express their per-
sonal opinions or experiences. Just as SMOs offline failed to
provide appropriate youth-centered participation opportuni-
ties, even when they invited youth to participate, SMOs
online are not providing the kinds of interactive opportunities
we would expect to fully engage youth. More interactive fea-
tures, like polls, games, and chatting features, are not com-
mon among both SMO-run and non-SMO websites. Instead,
the most common thing websites do is treat the web as another
broadcast forum in which they can distribute information.
Figure 6 breaks out feature set availability still further by
youth orientation as measured by the inclusion of youth con-
tent. Similar patterns exist as did in Figure 5, but there are
Figure 3. Youth Audience by SMO-affiliation and Movement
Issue Area.

Area.
Figure 5. Feature Sets by SMO-affiliation. Figure 6. Feature Set Availability by SMO-affiliation and Youth
Content Orientation.

some significant differences for youth-oriented websites ver-
sus non-youth oriented. SMO-run websites that are also
youth oriented are much more likely to allow uses to provide
info about a cause on the website (p<.05) and are also more
likely to include polls (p<.01).
Figure 7 provides the same information for youth audi-
ence oriented websites. Again, SMO-run websites are more
likely to allow users to provide information about a cause if
they are oriented toward a youth audience than if they are not
(p<.05). SMO-run websites are also more likely to include
games if they are oriented towards youth protest participa-
tion than if they are not (p
<
.05) (see Figure 8). Overall,
while having a youth orientation does increase the likelihood
that a SMO-run website will include some of interactive fea-
tures, even many of these youth-oriented websites are not
providing many interactive opportunities for users.
We also examine who produces content for websites--
young people or adults--on the assumption that youth-pro-
duced content may be more engaging for young people. We
cross this characteristic with our three different measures for
overall orientation, assuming, for instance, that youth-pro-
duced content directed at youth is different from adult-pro-
duced content directed at youth. Specifically, for youth
content, we examine the frequency of three arrangements:
(1) content produced by youth on youth-oriented websites
(i.e., "by youth for youth"), (2) content produced by adults
on a youth-oriented website (i.e., "by adults for youth"), and
(3) content produced by adults on an adult-oriented website
(i.e., "by adults for adults").4 Figure 9 shows the proportion
of websites that fall into these categories, stratifying those
figures by whether the site is SMO-run.
While there is a larger proportion of SMO-run websites in
the "by youth for youth" category than non-SMO websites,
the difference is not significant. But, there are significantly
more SMO-run websites in the by adults for youth category
(p<.01) than non-SMO sites, and significantly less SMO-run
websites in the by adults for adults category (p<.01). So, in
terms of mediated youth content, SMO-run websites are more
likely to be youth oriented, but the content is likely to be adult
produced. These data suggest that concerns about ageist prac-
tices in organizing offline (Gordon, 2007; Taft, 2014) may
also be relevant online, such that many SMOs see adults as
leading youth instead of youth being collaborators in change.
Figure 10 is similar to Figure 9 but uses youth audience to
establish which sites are "for youth." The difference between
SMO-run and non-SMO websites is not significant for the by
youth for youth category. As was true in Figure 9, there are
significantly more SMO-run websites in the by adults for
youth category than non-SMO websites (p<.05) and signifi-
cantly less in the by adults for adults category (p<.05). Here,
though, there is less youth orientation overall, with the vast
majority of both SMO-run and non-SMO websites falling in
the by adults for adults category.
This is also true if we focus on websites that are consid-
ered "for youth" when they invite youth protest participation
(see Figure 11). Here, the only significant difference is in the
proportion of SMO-run versus non-SMO websites that fall
into the by adults for youth category.

In sum, our data show that social movement presences
online, like their presences offline, are failing to do a good
job of engaging youth, or even at a more basic level, framing
youth as an important movement constituency. Online social
movement presences tend to be quite adult-oriented and
adult-produced, which matches the adult orientation of most
offline SMOs, and movement web presences have few fea-
ture sets that are expected to draw in youth. While this is not
ubiquitously the case, or constant across different issues
areas, and can be slightly less exaggerated for SMO-run sites
than non-SMO sites, it nonetheless appears that the social
movement sector, and SMO-run sites, are not doing much to
connect with young people, even though that is important to
the socialization of young people and to the generational
continuity of movements.
A critical reader may reply that these findings are expected
because SMOs are simply responding to a real and irremedia-
ble lack of interest on the part of youth or the unresponsive-
ness of youth to SMO engagement. That is, an alternative
explanation for what is driving our findings is a rational deci-
sion by SMOs to not target youth because youth don't want to
be active and/or connecting with youth doesn't affect youth
engagement. This explanation is in line with claims that youth
are not as politically and civically engaged as previous genera-
tions (Putnam, 2000). To assess this possibility, in the next two
sections, we use survey data of youth's political engagement
to assess the extent to which youth are interested in and engage
in politics, including social movements, as well as the extent
to which youth are active in formal political organizations and
the impacts of that involvement.
Data: Youth Participation in Activism
In order to assess the extent to which there is demand for advo-
cacy among youth and whether SMO-membership impacts
youth involvement, we use the Youth Participatory Politics
(YPP) Survey. The YPP Survey is a 2011 nationally repre-
sented survey of 15- to 25-year-olds in the United States. The
survey was administered by Knowledge Networks (KN),
which maintains KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative
pool of potential participants in online surveys.
KnowledgePanel participants are identified by KN through an
address-based sampling method. Participants are given a home
computer, if they do not already own one, and are enrolled in
the Internet-based survey service. Clients of KN may design
surveyswhichareadministeredtoasampleofKnowledgePanel
participants, which is constructed to ensure the representative-
ness of the sample, the ability of researchers to analyze key
populations, and prevent KnowledgePanel burnout from over
sampling. The YPP survey was commissioned by Mills
College and administered by KN. In addition to the online sur-
vey, a smaller sample completed the survey via the telephone.
Mills also conducted their own survey, consisting of identical
questions, using an address-based sampling technique. In all,
2,920 people completed the survey, with a completion rate of
94.7% of eligible participants online, 42.4% of eligible phone
participants, and 46.8% of eligible participants in the address-
based sampling supplement. We use the included survey
weight to generate the following graphs and other analyses.
In prior work, we constructed measures for youth engage-
ment generally (Elliott & Earl, forthcoming). We recreate
and re-explain those measures here. Participants were asked
about a variety of behaviors and opinions related to their use
of the Internet for political, volunteer, and hobby-based pur-
poses. From these questions, we construct measures of four
different kinds of political participation: institutional, social
movement, volunteer, and participatory. Each is a dummy
variable, turned on if a respondent affirms they have partici-
pated in a qualifying activity in the last twelve months.
Institutional politics consists of seven activities
(alpha=.65) including (1) having voted in the 2010 elections;
supporting a candidate, political party, or political issue by (2)
working on a campaign; (3) wearing a campaign button, put-
ting a campaign sticker on their car, or placing a sign in their
window or front yard; (4) expressing support through a social
Figure 11. Youth Protest Participation Mediation by SMO-
affiliation.
Figure 10. Youth Audience Mediation by SMO-affiliation.
10 Social Media + Society
network; (5) raising or donating money online; (6) raising or
donating money offline; or (6) signing up to receive informa-
tion from a candidate or campaign via email.
The social movement indicator also consisted of seven
qualifying activities (alpha=.71): (1) supporting a candidate,
political party, or political issue by attending a meeting, rally,
speech or dinner; (2) starting or joining a political group on a
social network site; (3) taking part in a protest, demonstra-
tion, or sit-in; (4) participating in a boycott; (5) participating
in a "buycott," which is like a boycott except that people
preferentially buy from a specific seller or buy a particularly
product to show support; (6) signing a paper petition; or (7)
signing an online petition.
Volunteering consisted of three qualifying activities
(alpha=.67): (1) having raised money for a charitable cause,
(2) participated in a community service or volunteer activity,
or (3) worked on cooperated with others to try to solve a
nonpolitical problem affecting their city or neighborhood.
We also include a novel category for participatory engage-
ment in politics. Recent research on youth political participa-
tion online finds that youth haven't disengaged from politics,
rather they are engaging in new and different ways (Kahne,
Middaugh, & Allen, 2014). This research conceptualizes this
new engagement as "participatory politics," which involves
interactive, peer-based actions designed to give youth a politi-
cal voice without deference to elites (Cohen et al., 2012). We
construct an indicator for participatory politics5 that includes
six activities related to a political campaign, candidate, or
issue (alpha
=
.74): (1) forwarded or posted someone else's
political commentary or news; (2) contributed their own arti-
cle, opinion piece, picture, or video; (3) forwarded or circu-
lated funny videos or cartoons or circulated something artistic;
(4) commented on a news story or blog they read online; (5)
written an email or written a blog; or (6) participated in an
event where young people express their political views, such
as a poetry slam, musical event, and so on.
We also use a question asking respondents if they had
been active in a political or social group in the last 12 months,
and an open-ended question asking what group they were
active in to measure the kinds of organizations youth are
likely to join.
Results: Youth Participation in Activism
Figure 12 shows the breakdown of youth who participate in
any of the four categories of action (participatory, social
movement, institutional or volunteering) described above as
well as the breakdown of youth who are members of political
or social organizations. Contrary to critical expectations that
youth are uninterested in politics, nearly three quarters of
youth engaged in some sort of political activity! But, only
10% of youth claimed membership in an organization, sug-
gesting that for the majority of youth, political participation
is happening outside formal organizations.
This lack of organizational involvement is not stopping
political engagement, but it is also not maximizing it.
According to Figure 13, being a member of an organization
makes one much more likely to engage in all four types of
action (all p<.001). Of youth who are members of an organi-
zation, over 80% engage in institutional activity, as opposed
to less than 50% of non-members. Similar patterns exist for
social movement, volunteer, and participatory political activ-
ity, with organizational members roughly twice as likely to
engage in the activity as non-members.
This is a key finding because it suggests that although most
youth are not connected to organizations, or SMOs specifi-
cally, organizational ties do significantly bolster engagement.
This suggests that it is possible that if SMOs were better
engaging youth, youth might be even more active than they
already are, and they may be active through organizations that
have proven effective at political socialization and strategic
action. In other words, arguments that suggest that SMOs
don't target youth because youth aren't interested in being
active and because SMO-connections don't influence youth
engagement are wrong on both accounts.
Figure 12. Youth Organizational Membership and Youth
Participation. Figure 13. Percent of Youth Engaging in Activities by
Organizational Membership.
Elliott and Earl 11
Because youth are engaging in some organizations, we were
interested in the correspondence at the macro level between the
kinds of organizations youth are involved in and the issues
areas that did better and worse at reaching out to youth in the
website-based data. We lack data to assess micro-level prefer-
ences by youth and the extent to which those preferences are
satisfied or not. Figure 14 shows the types of organizations in
which youth reported being members. We took the open-ended
question about group membership and categorized member-
ships according to the 20 issue areas used in collecting the web-
site data. The most common type of organization was the
catch-all "other" category. Common organizations within this
category included animal welfare organizations, as well as
party-affiliated (Republican and Democratic) groups. In other
words, organizations aside from SMOs are much more effec-
tive at connecting with youth, suggesting that SMOs may be
able to learn from volunteer and party-affiliated organizations
about how to better connect with youth.
The top five organizations after the "other" category were
as follows: LGBTQ, civic, church, education, and right wing.
Both LGBTQ and right wing organizations are likely SMO-
related, but only LGBTQ appeared among the top issue areas
in terms of youth orientation for SMO-run websites. This
mismatch between the types of organizations youth are com-
monly members of and the issue areas in which organiza-
tions are most reaching out to youth may also help to explain
why so few youth are members of organizations ­ the orga-
nizations they'd rather be members of are not doing a good
job of reaching out to youth, while those that are doing a
good job, youth aren't as frequently involved in.
Discussion and Conclusion
Contrary to what some have claimed, a growing body of
research is showing that youth are quite engaged in political
and civic life. As past research has found, and the survey
results reported on here show, youth engage in a variety of
different actions, including social movement, institutional
political, volunteer, and participatory political actions.
However, they are largely pursuing that engagement outside
of formal organizations, including SMOs, even though orga-
nizational affiliations increase the likelihood of youth
engagement. As our results show, 90% of youth were not
members of a political or social organization yet nearly three
quarters were engaged in some sort of political or civic activ-
ity. But, when one is a member or an organization, their like-
lihood for acting rises sharply.
Given the historical importance of SMOs to movements,
and their historically important role in recruitment and
retention, these findings are surprising and troubling. And
yet, our investigation of social movement web presences,
including SMO-run web presences, found that movements
and SMOs, themselves, are at least partly to blame for this.
Social movement web presences generally do a poor job of
providing opportunities for youth to become engaged
online, or at even more basic level, of positioning youth as
a relevant or even acknowledged constituency. Less than
half of SMO-run websites were youth oriented along any of
the three axis of youth engagement, and when SMO-run
websites do have a youth focus, they are most likely to be
produced by adults for youth, instead of by youth for youth,
which is consistent with the findings in research about
offline youth engagement in SMOs. Our analyses attempted
to avoid painting all causes with the same brush to reduce
the risk of overgeneralization. However, while there were
some issue areas that did better than others, particularly the
LGBT, green, and labor movements, none were consis-
tently inviting youth to participate in advocacy activities.
Furthermore, most SMO-run websites failed to include
interactive features that research has shown are effective at
engaging youth online, and they tend to be more likely to be
adult-produced even when targeting youth, findings that are
congruent with difficulties found in offline SMOs' engage-
ment with youth. Moreover, those issue areas that stood out
as providing opportunities for youth to engage were not the
same issue areas that youth themselves tended to be organi-
zational members in, suggesting a mismatch at the macro
level between the opportunities that do exist online for
youth, and the kinds of opportunities youth are actually
looking for. Overall, our findings show that youth are inter-
ested in being politically active, but are not being provided
ample opportunities to engage through SMOs online.
Instead, movements and SMOs are no more inviting to
youth engagement online than prior research has found
them to be offline. Given that we are studying web pres-
ences that (1) are controlled by SMOs and so represent their
own strategic self-representations and (2) occur across plat-
forms, ranging from traditional websites to publicly acces-
sible social media presences, this lack of youth connection
is particularly troubling because these should be the lowest
hanging fruits for SMOs eager to engage youth online.
Figure 14. Distribution of Movement Organizational
Membership for Youth Organizational Members.
12 Social Media + Society
In examining these issues, we have addressed one of the
most important questions about youth and political engage-
ment offline in an online context, asking how SMO versus
non-SMO run web presences frame youth as constituencies,
collaborators, and/or participants. We find that the same
problems that have dogged youth engagement in offline
SMOs seem to be present online too, which can lead one to
believe that the online problems we show are simply an
extension of offline dynamics.
While this may be, we want to acknowledge the possibil-
ity that patterns we observed may be accelerated by trends in
digital activism more generally. In other words, it is possible
that causes of our findings owe to both general tendencies
among movements that are reflected in both offline and
online activities, but are also exaggerated by digital dynam-
ics. Recent research suggests that formal organizations may
not be necessary to organize activity online (Bimber,
Flanagin, & Stohl, 2005; Earl, 2015; Earl & Kimport, 2011;
Earl & Schussman, 2003). Online activity can be more spon-
taneous, and can require far fewer resources to plan, orga-
nize, and implement (Bimber et al., 2005). For instance, for
certain types of advocacy, opportunities to participate (e.g.,
online petitions, distributed denial of service campaigns) can
be supplied through the efforts of only one or a few individu-
als online and without a formal organization (Earl & Kimport,
2011; Garrett, 2006; Shirky, 2008). This activity also usually
has far lower barriers to participation than its offline counter-
part (Bennett & Fielding, 1999), so that organizations do not
need to incentivize participation as they often need to do for
offline advocacy (Bimber et al., 2005; Klandermans, 1984).
The Internet provides communication tools that make
messaging and organizing groups of people orders of magni-
tude easier than it has been in the past (Garrett, 2006). Using
social media networks, activists can spread their message
broadly, potentially sending out a call to action that, through
the various resharing features available on these sites, could
quickly spread to reach millions. The energy and expertise
required to do this is minimal, reducing the resources
required to mobilize large groups of people.
If these digital trends are impacting how youth engage,
and SMOs and movements more generally are failing to try to
connect with youth online, a generation of young people may
grow up with far more attenuated relationships to SMOs than
has been true in the past. This could have a number of poten-
tially critical implications for social movements. First and
foremost, this lack of youth engagement with SMOs risks a
generation or more of youth not being politically socialized
into collective action through formal organizations and thus
less concerned about the health and vitality about SMOs. It is
too early to tell whether this will affect the frequency or per-
sistence of activism across the lifecourse, but it certainly
might. Organizations can provide stability and community
that encourages future activism. If youth engage in activism
without formal organizations, their participation may not per-
sist into adulthood the way previous generations of activists
have. Second, the future of SMOs themselves is imperiled if
they are unable to replace their ranks and attract supporters
over time. At a minimum, continued disengagement from
SMOs across the lifecourse could further separate an already
professionalized activist cadre from grassroots activists (Earl,
2013). But, at its most severe, if SMOs are unable to recruit
youth into their membership, they may be unable to continue
to be viable. Without healthy SMOs, a movement may be
unable to survive rough times, leading to a precipitous decline
in the movement sector.

Notes
1. Of course, individual SMOs will vary in how much they
engage in each of these activities, and how well they are at
engaging in these activities. However, all SMOs, at least to
some extent, will be involved in recruitment processes, as that
is a core function of any organization.
2. References to fetuses, which were common among abortion
related websites, were not coded as about youth.
3. We calculate t-tests for all differences between SMO-run and
non-SMO sites, but only report on significant differences.
Since our sample is a random sample, representative of all
advocacy oriented, reachable websites, a t-test for difference
of proportions is appropriate here.
4. A fourth category included content produced by youth on a
website that is oriented toward adults, but this occurs so rarely
that we drop this category from our analyses.
5. Cohen, et al. (2012) used 11 items from the survey to construct
their measure of participatory politics. However, they did not
construct a measure of social movement participation. We
used five of the items Cohen, et al., used in their participatory
politics measure to construct our social movement participa-
tion measure. Thus, our statistics on participation in participa-
tory politics differ from those presented in Cohen et al. (2012).
