Introduction
A digital video recorder (DVR) enables viewers to pause,
rewind, record, and playback selected programs at their con-
venient time. Although video cassette recorder (VCR) also
offered most of these features, the ease and significant
recording capacity attracted users toward DVR.
The practice of fast forwarding the commercials has led to
serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of advertise-
ments when fast forwarded by the viewers (Maddox, 2006).
Although various interesting studies have suggested that
smart advertisements make an impact on TV viewers even
when fast forwarded, these concerns have still persisted
(Consoli, 2005, 2007; Wurtzel, 2006).
Kishore (2003) highlights the claims made by early DVR
users regarding the impact of new technology on television
viewing and skipping the advertisements leading to adverse
impact on traditional television advertising. As a result, it is
estimated that by 2007, practice of time-shifted viewing and
skipping of advertisements would reduce traditional ad-
viewing by 19% leading to loss of US$7 billion from tradi-
tional TV ad revenue (Forrester, 2002).
Hollis (2005) also opines that attractive features of DVRs
such as time shifting, recording, pausing live TV and replay-
ing where it was left, and saving time by fast forwarding bor-
ing advertisements would soon make it an indispensable
home appliance. A study conducted by Fann-Im (2004)
revealed that more than 50% of all DVR users found fast
forwarding through commercials as their favorite feature.
Hollis (2005) brings a ray of hope for the advertisers and
expresses that this however does not imply that the viewers
would not see advertisement at all. The study indicated that
even while fast forwarding, the viewers get to see rapid
sequence of images with no sound, which still creates some
impact. Therefore, fast forwarding may pose a threat to
advertising business but cannot completely destroy the
impact of ads on the viewers. Gilmore and Secuna (1993)
also expressed that fast forwarded ads bring back memories
of the product in the viewers' mind. This argument was con-
tradicted by Cronin and Menelly (1992) who mentioned that
viewers fast forward all the ads without any selection and
prior judgment.
Negroponte (1995) opines that increasing access to digital
technologies has enhanced the consumers' control over
media consumption, thus leading to lesser requirement for
real-time broadcast. It has been predicted by forecasters that
this rapid shift from "a world of linear TV to on-demand"
would require a "radical rethink of advertising supported
programming."

DVR and Its Impact on Indian Market:
Now and in Future
Shalini Kalia1
Abstract
The television viewing experience has been completely revolutionized with the advent of digital video recorder (DVR). The
comfort and ease of watching programs at one's own convenience and saving time by fast forwarding the commercials have
completely changed the viewers' life style. Considering the fact, that fast forwarding of commercials defeats the ultimate
purpose of reaching out to TV viewers, a lot is at stake for the advertisers who ignore the impact of DVRs on advertising.
International advertising market has already started adopting creative ways to hold the viewers' attention in this time-shifted
world. The available literature review on impact of DVRs is mainly related to the United States and European countries;
hardly any research has been done in this regard in context to India. This study is based on literature review to understand
the threats and opportunities of DVRs in global market, identify the creative strategies adopted by other countries to combat
these threats, analyze the current situation of impact of DVRs in Indian market, and make recommendations for future in
context to India.

Aim of the Study
The available literature review on DVR is mainly related to
the United States and European countries. The research on
impact of DVRs in context to India has been very limited.
Therefore, this study, conducted in 2012-2013, is a literature
review to
·
· Understand the threats and opportunities of DVRs in
global market
·
· Identify the creative strategies adopted by other coun-
tries to combat threats posed by DVRs
·
· Analyze the current situation of impact of DVR in
Indian market and make recommendations for future
in context to India.
Method
An extensive literature review was done to understand the
impact of DVR on global market.Approximately 45 research
papers and articles were studied to get an in-depth under-
standing of the topic.
Results and Discussion
DVR Penetration
In the United States, DVR was introduced in 1999, devel-
oped and marketed by TiVo, Inc. Since then, the product has
been made available in many other countries such as
Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico,
Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. In developed markets such
as the United States and the United Kingdom, DVR numbers
have reached a critical mass. The DVR penetration in the
United States had gone from 1% in 2006 to 43% of all TV
viewing households in 2011 as per a "Pay TV in the US"
report by Mintel, a market research firm (Bapna, 2012a).
Brecht (2011) expressed that DVR penetration had dou-
bled in the previous 2 years with its presence in 38.1% of all
U.S. homes; thus, advertisers cannot afford to ignore this
rapid growth of DVR while planning television marketing
campaigns. Figure 1 indicates estimates of revenues attribut-
able to the U.S. DVR industry from 1999 to 2010 (Schaeffler,
2009) according to which the DVR revenue significantly
increased from US$111 million to US$5,200 million in these
years.
In the United Kingdom, penetration has crossed 50% in
2011, according to Deloitte Technology's media and tele-
communication practice (Bapna, 2012a). A report in Cable
Quest Broadband (2009) projected that in the United
Kingdom and Ireland, the DVR service was in more than 5
million homes; in Australia, two out of three set top boxes
(STBs) deployed were DVR enabled; and in the United
States, DVRs were provided as a standard feature by most
operators.
In India, DVR adoption is still nascent and is estimated at
400,000 households, or less than 4% of the TV viewing
homes till 2011 (Bapna, 2012a). A rapid growth rate in DVR
ownership has been predicted in Asian countries with India
having the second highest level of DVR subscribers in Asia
by 2013 and overtaking Japan to have the highest number of
DVR subscribers by 2018 (refer Table 1).

DVR revenues in Asia Pacific have been predicted to be
witnessing significant growth rates. With Japan as leader,
China, Korea, and India are other major Asian markets that
would witness large increase in DVR revenues. DVR reve-
nue of US$68 million is projected to be generated by India
till 2018 (refer Figure 2).
Arecent review of digitization progress by the Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting (2012) has revealed that 68%
of cable TV digitization has already been achieved in the
four metro cities of India--Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and
Chennai. City-wise data show that digitization in Mumbai is
95%, in Kolkata 67%, in Delhi 53%, and in Chennai 49%. A
study by Media Partners Asia predicted India to be the larg-
est direct to home (DTH) market in the world in terms of
subscribers by 2012 and estimated 45 million subscribers by
2014. These are massive numbers for an industry that has not
even completed a decade since its inception (Sawant, 2011).
With the exceptional growth of telecom sector in India in
the past few years, it can be safely said that Indian market is
ripe for adopting new technologies. DVR will soon be con-
sidered as essential as the mobile phone as in other leading
markets in the world. Navin Talreja, president of Ogilvy for
Mumbai and Kolkata, emphasizes that huge social factors
that could make DVR big in India are large families and the
nature of programming (Bapna, 2012a). In a detailed chat
with the Economic Times (Bapna, 2012b), Atul Phadnis
opines that TV series, which hold the viewers' attention and
force them to regularly follow these programs, are one of the
major reasons for DVR's success in India. Although for seri-
als in mainline languages there are repeat telecasts, they are
generally broadcast at odd hours; hence, the DVR acts as a
useful resource. For programs broadcast in regional lan-
guages, the main TV serials are not repeated; hence, viewers
are even more anxious about missing any episode, thus
increasing the possibility of increased DVR penetration in
the Indian market. The other element for better DVR pene-
tration in India could be increasing interest of newer genera-
tion in sports. With international live matches being telecast
on a U.S. time or Euro time, the need of DVR becomes all
the more relevant. Moreover, TV viewers in India have been
frustrated with too many ads within the programs and wish to
opt for interruption-free entertainment. Therefore, India
could be considered a major potential market for DVR in
future; however, the price may be one of the major stumbling
blocks for its penetration.
With the launch of DVR in the United States in 1999,
research has proven that it posed major challenges to adver-
tising world forcing advertisers to think of innovative strate-
gies. In India, DVR was first launched by Tata Sky in 2008
followed by other players such as Dish TV, Airtel, Reliance,
and so on. The penetration of DVR in India was less than 4%
till 2011, which currently may not be an alarming situation.
However, Indian market is quite receptive to technological
innovations and with the mandatory digitization process in
metropolitan cities, increase of affluent class, and working
couples, the chances of DVR penetration in coming years are
quite high.
Impact of DVRs on Advertising
Many researchers believe that DVR threatens television
advertising because of the commercial skipping feature
(Association of National Advertisers/Forrester Research
Survey, 2006; Goetzl, 2006), whereas others downplay such
concerns (W. Friedman, 2006; Solman, 2007). Depending on
different viewpoints, DVRs are either boon or bane. It may
be considered a boon for TV viewers because DVRs allow
them to watch their favorite programs at their convenient
timings. Moreover, it is also beneficial for television net-
works as they are able to reach out to viewers who are not
able to watch programs when they are broadcast. The adver-
tisers may consider it a bane as this facility allows viewers to
skip through the television commercials by fast forwarding
and ultimately, reducing the overall return on investment
(ROI) of television advertising funds.
It is surprising to know that despite the extent of TV
advertising market and the impact DVRs already have on
advertising business, the advertisers, agencies, and about
70% of advertising executives lack understanding on the

change in advertising strategies required due to DVR revolu-
tion (DVR Research Institute, 2010).
Brown (2011) comments that advent of DVR is not the
sole reason behind the change in TV viewing environment.
Other devices and technologies such as smart phones, tab-
lets, social media, and TV viewing over the Internet pose
more substantial challenges to TV advertising than DVRs.
However, TV remains a formidable advertising vehicle and
thus, it is important to discuss TV advertising, the challenges
it faces, and the way advertisers can respond to those
challenges.
DVRs as a Threat
The advertising world has witnessed a significant stir since
the advent of DVR. Goetzl (2006) reports that essentially all
DVR users fast forward through advertising, and marketers
are considering this crucial change in TV viewing very seri-
ously. An alarming response of survey done with large
national advertisers (Bernoff, 2004) revealed that due to
drastic increase in DVR usage, 75% of respondents planned
to reduce the budget allocation for television advertising and
70% responded that DVRs would minimize the efficacy of
"traditional 30-second commercials."
Debraj Tripathy, managing director of MediaCom India, a
media planning and buying agency, comments that if DVR
numbers explode, planners and advertises will have a tough
time. Consumers will skip through ads and watch what they
want at a time that is suitable to them; and planners will vir-
tually be able to do nothing about it (Bapna, 2012a). Thus,
media planning and creative execution will be significantly
affected with excessive control of consumers on advertising
medium.
Research claims that up to 80% of all primetime program-
ming in DVR households are time-shifted and out of this,
65% to 75% of all commercials are skipped by the users
(Posnack, 2004). Mandese (2004) also reports that "an aver-
age of 53 percent of TV commercials are skipped in DVR
households, but the ad zapping is much higher, 77 percent,
for the portion of programming they view on a recorded
basis." Thus, time-shifting feature and convenience to skip
commercials are two major challenges faced by advertisers
in getting their commercials noticed.
DVR Research Institute (2010) projects that more than
80% of advertising executives are concerned about the cru-
cial impact of DVR on TV advertising and consider this even
a bigger threat to TV advertising than the shift in media con-
sumption or the increased use of Internet. As per the study,
impact of DVR on efficacy of TV advertising is based on the
components such as "number of TV households with DVR;
percentage of TV watching time-shifted in DVR households;
number of ads skipped in time-shifted mode; impact of
DVRs on the cost of advertising." The impact measured on
these components could vary depending on "the target audi-
ence and its ethnicity, location, socio-demographics, age,
etc., and with factors like program genre and day part."
Brecht (2011) mentions in a report that the percentage of
DVR users, who skip all or most commercials, is approxi-
mately 80%, which may lead to significant reduction in ROI
for television advertising. Another report projected that
"with total TV advertising in 2008 estimated at $80 billion,
the value foregone from fast-forwarding of commercials cur-
rently reflects approximately $5 billion." The end of 2008
witnessed 6% fast-forwarded commercials of all TV com-
mercials; however, this percentage is likely to nearly triple
by the end of 2011. Therefore, there is a lot at stake for
advertisers who are striving to get the best returns on invest-
ments made on TV advertising (Research and Markets,
2009). This is further validated by research quoted in
Campaign (2005, PHD) reporting 32% loss of commercial
impacts if personal video recorders (PVR) and video on
demand (VoD) reach all U.K. homes by 2010. Therefore,
DVR's impact on ROI from TV advertising cannot be
ignored and requires significant measures to control the
extent of losses made by DVRs.
DVRs as an Opportunity
TV viewers enjoy great choice and control through DVR.
Ferguson and Perse (2004) make an interesting claim that
DVR owners not only relish recorded television programs
but also enjoy watching live programs as this gives them
greater control on media choice. Hollis (2005) shows a ray of
hope to the media planners and highlights that not all viewers
are Type "A" go-getters with busy schedules who consider
their TV viewing a business task. Others, who may be cate-
gorized as Type "B," still like to utilize the TV viewing expe-
rience as time to relax and would not completely depend on
time-shifted programming. The study also adds that even if
viewers fast forward ads, they are at least engaged and not
distracted by other technical gadgets. DVRs have an added
advantage over VCRs as while fast forwarding through
DVR, the viewers can see images and they can stop and
replay the ad if something attracts them in terms of relevant
information or enjoyable content. If, by 2010, DVR penetra-
tion is 40%, with 33% viewing pre-recorded content, and
80% of ad exposures being avoided, then only 10% of poten-
tial exposure will be lost to DVR usage. Although it would
adversely affect the impact of TV advertising, it is definitely
not an indicator of end of TV advertising. Even in a worse
scenario of 60% DVR penetration, 50% pre-recorded view-
ing, and 80% avoidance to lower ad exposure by 25%, it can-
not be claimed that fast-forward exposure has no benefit.
However, undoubtedly, TV advertisers and agencies will
have to change their strategies in developing and positioning
of ads to maximize their effectiveness.
Nielsen (2010) reports an interesting observation and
states that "Contrary to fears that DVRs would wipe out the
value of commercials because of viewers fast-forwarding
through ads, DVRs actually contribute significantly to com-
mercial viewing." A study conducted with DVR users
between 18 and 49 years reported an increase of 44% rating
Kalia 5
in 3 days following the broadcast for a primetime commer-
cial minute.
Stelter (2010) adds that DVR owners are spending more
time on watching TV and the ratings of commercials for
some shows targeted for youngsters increased by more than
50% when played back within 3 days. Interestingly, most of
the DVR users are the ones who are tech savvy and during
the commercials, they are also actively engaged in media
multitasking such as texting, face booking, and so on, using
that time until the commercial is over. Therefore, instead of
fast forwarding the ads, this segment uses the commercial
breaks for effective multitasking.
Even if we assume that most of the DVR owners fast
forward the commercials, another U.K.-based research
proves that fast-forward exposure too has an impact. In a
controlled experiment of fast-forward viewing at 30 times
the normal speed, it was concluded that this induced a posi-
tive emotional response for ads previously run on prime-
time TV. This emotional response was not observed for the
ads to which respondents were not exposed earlier, hence
proving that "prior exposure leads the mind to respond pos-
itively even to a subsequent fleeting exposure" (Hollis,
2005). du Plessis (2009) also highlights that by giving
attention while fast forwarding, people not only recognize
the advertisement, but in the process of recognition, they
experience similar emotional memories as when they first
cognized the advertisement. Thus, in contrast to "live or by
appointment" TV viewing, where viewers tend to skip ads
by surfing other channels or getting involved with other
activities, DVR users are glued to the screen while fast for-
warding through ads, hence increasing the possibility of
experiencing the ads at some level (Tse & Lee, 2001; Van
Meurs, 1998).
A. Friedman (2010) brings another interesting aspect that
although TV viewing through DVR enhances ad skipping,
the demand for advertised product does not get affected by
owning a DVR. This gives another sigh of relief to the adver-
tisers as DVRs may not have a direct impact on ROI. With
DVRs getting more affordable, they are the second most
important household item, after the mobile phone.
The wide penetration and popularity of the DVR may,
however, lead to threat for other businesses in entertainment
sector. Purchasing and renting of DVDs is one such business
that has got immensely affected by this. In a survey done
with DVR owners who actively utilized the recording facil-
ity of DVR in the previous year, it was found that 40% of
them purchased fewer DVDs and 38% rented fewer DVDs in
that duration (Technology, Media, and Telecommunications
Predictions, 2011).
Implications for Media Planning and Creative
Development
Although the extent to which the economic structure of
broadcast and cable television would be affected by DVRs is
not certain, the strong possibility of these devices changing
the current "advertising-supported business model" is defi-
nitely indicated by industry experts (Learmonth, 2003). If
advertisers are to keep up with the changing force in the
media marketplace, they must thoroughly understand how
audiences "behave" in the emerging media environment
(Lin, 1994, p. 30). It has been researched that DVR owners
have higher incomes, better education, and more children
than other television viewers (Story, 2007). They tend to be
younger than the average viewer and exhibit increased tele-
vision usage (W. Friedman, 2006). Thus, advertisers will
have to analyze the target audience and their behavior to
combat the challenges posed by DVR.
In the countries with significant DVR penetration, adver-
tisers are already indulging in designing creative TV adver-
tising strategies to combat the challenges imposed by DVRs.
The report by DVR Research Institute (2010) suggests the
following three-step approach that advertisers may consider
to reach out to consumers even in time-shifted world:
Step1--EstablishthefactbaseaboutDVRs:Advertisers
who do not correctly assess the basic facts about DVRs
and their impact on TV advertising are likely to either
overestimate or underestimate the true impact and either
overreact or underreact to DVRs. This, in turn, will result
in waste in advertising spending.
Step 2--Evaluate best-practice strategies in response
to the impact of DVRs: Some of the measures that lead-
ing advertising executives are already taking, or consider-
ing taking are
·
· Using alternate forms of TV advertising (e.g., product
placement, pop-up ads, sponsorship, etc.)
·
· Selecting appropriate time of ad broadcast (prime-
time, night time, day time, etc.)
·
· Reconsidering TV budget allocations (vs. Internet or
other media)
·
· Advertising in the programs that viewers prefer
watching when broadcast (news, sports, etc.)
·
· Positioning of advertisement (first, middle, last)
·
· Strategizing the length of the advertisement and the
airing frequency
Step 3--Tailor these strategies to your goals: The
advertising strategies are to be designed based on cam-
paign type, target audience, and program/day part.
The challenges posed by DVRs have motivated advertis-
ers to identify strategies that effectively help overcome the
challenges imposed by DVR and leverage its benefits. The
creative strategies that have been identified through litera-
ture review are as follows (Brecht, 2011; Brown, 2011;
Hollis, 2005):
1. Contextual advertising: By integrating the advertis-
ing product in show's context, the advertisement sub-
tly creates an impact on the viewers.
6 SAGE Open
2. Addressable advertising: This strategy works smartly
by telecasting targeted ads in different households
based on certain characteristics or demographics. As
a result, viewers watch ads of their interest during a
program leading to a possibility of ad avoidance.
3. Designing of ads to work well in fast-forward envi-
ronment: Placing the most powerful branding cues in
the center of the screen; identifying the features that
trigger positive brand associations; and using attrac-
tive colors, logos, or characters enhance the ad visi-
bility even when fast forwarded. Another interesting
strategy to hold audience's attention is to create ads
that play in slow motion during live viewing, so that
all of the ad's content, not just the brand cues, is
clearly recognizable when fast forwarded.
4. Knowing your audience: Knowing the target audi-
ence; knowing what their time-shifting/fast-forward-
ing style is; tailoring ads and media placement
accordingly helps in reaching out to TV viewers.
Initial ad placements in programs with high levels of
live viewing (e.g., sports, news) would maximize the
probability that they will be seen in "normal" view-
ing mode prior to fast forwarding.
5. Using strong visual icons and compelling campaign
themes to perform better in a fast-forward world:
Strong visual icons related to the category, brand,
prior ads in a campaign, or target audience need to be
featured in the ad preferably near the beginning to
ensure that viewers do not skip the ad. All these tech-
niques will help the viewer identify, although at a
non-conscious level, whether the ad is going to be of
interest to him or her.
6. Engaging people emotionally: People who may have
shifted their focus to other technological gadgets will
get attracted by ad that interests them. If ads engage
people emotionally, they will be watched over and
over again, just because they enjoy the viewing
experience.
7. Using high-interest product categories and high-
affinity brands for having an innate advantage in a
DVR world: Having an interest in the brand and
product category increases the possibility of stopping
and watching a specific ad, thus indicating that high-
interest product categories and high-affinity brands
will have an innate advantage in the DVR world.
DVR companies have been experimenting various meth-
ods to debilitate the impact of fast forwarding. In one such
attempt, advertisements of branded products were placed at
the end of recorded shows, but their effectiveness could not
be measured (Gonsalves, 2006; Shim, 2005). To avert the
DVR impact, some companies even went to an extent of sug-
gesting disabling of fast-forward button during commercial
break (Stross, 2006) but anticipated the strong consumer
resistance. Therefore, instead of avoiding the fast-forwarding
feature, advertisers will have to make the ads as effective as
possible even when watched in fast-forwarded mode.
Therefore, it is critical to use the appropriate advertising
strategies for right impact. Advertising costs are significant
and wrong allocation of funds can result in major losses. The
need of the hour is to have perfect blend of placement and
creative strategy while designing ads so as to get the maxi-
mum attention of the viewers. Hence, in the DVR age, it is
the job of media planners to ensure that content attracts peo-
ple even if it is fast forwarded.
Conclusion and Recommendations
There is no doubt that DVRs pose lot of challenges to media
planners, but it is definitely not the end of TV advertising. To
convert these challenges into opportunities, the advertisers
and media planners have to be much more creative in design-
ing and positioning of ads during the programs. Till 2011,
DVR penetration in India was less than 4% in contrast to
43% in the United States and about 50% in the United
Kingdom; therefore, the challenges posed by DVRs on TV
advertising in Indian market are not alarming in near future.
A Coca-Cola spokesperson opines (Bapna, 2012a) that DVR
market is in the initial stage in India and will take some time
to have an impact. However, Indians'fad for technology may
lead to its fast adoption and therefore, a timely strategic plan-
ning to effectively manage the DVR challenges will be of
great help.
Taking clue from the strategies followed by the countries
where DVR penetration is much higher than India, media
planners can consider them as precedent and customize in
Indian context to combat the DVR challenges in Indian mar-
ket. These may include buying ad spots at the start or the end
of a commercial break; resorting to other forms of TV adver-
tising such as product placements, pop-up ads, and sponsor-
ships; relying on strong iconic and visual imagery that can
stand out during fast forwarding; and widening the basket of
allocation to include different kinds of programming, from
news to sports.
Moreover, to overcome the possible downside of DVR
fast forwarding, media planners will have to ensure that the
fast-forwarded ads have already been seen by viewers at nor-
mal speed. This could be done by preliminary placement of
ads in programs that are generally not fast forwarded such as
sports, news, and so on. Hence, media departments'planning
will have to emphasize programming, not time slots to under-
stand which programs are most often viewed in real time and
which are likely to be time-shifted.
An interesting observation made on viewing behavior is
that it is older male viewers who are most likely to fast for-
ward through commercials; younger people are more likely
to let the commercials play. This is not because the younger
people are riveted to their TV screens during the commercial
break but because they have other screens to attend to--their
phones, their tablets, and their PCs--and so live viewing still
Kalia 7
predominates (Brown, 2011). This observation may be judi-
ciously utilized by the media planners in positioning of the
TV ads.
Many researchers do not consider DVR to be a threat and
believe that this would not lead to the end of TV advertising
and all the panic was uncalled for. They have expressed that
fast forwarding through commercials requires an active
involvement that not all viewers bring to their leisure time
TV entertainment; thus, it would remain a "lean-back"
medium where many viewers would take the path of least
resistance and let the commercials roll. Even if DVR users
fast forward the advertisements, it has been observed that
they are attentive to commercials. Thus, the impact of fast
forwarding of advertisements on sales may not be equal to
the ads that are not seen at all.
Over and above, smart phones, tablets, and social media,
working in concert with ever-decreasing attention spans,
pose more substantial challenges to TV advertising than do
DVRs. Therefore, it can be concluded that DVR is a boon for
the TV viewers and with smart advertising strategies, media
planners can excel in reaching out to viewers with significant
ROI.
