Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research
Update (2000­2016)

Abstract
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate
earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to
therapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA
disclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon's literature review framework, 33
studies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and
future research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to
practice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (1) Disclosure is an
iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure
models reflect a social­ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,
familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there
is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have
been made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-
closure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.
Barriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-
itators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future
research.

Introduction
Timely access to supportive and therapeutic resources for child
sexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health
and mental health well-being of children, youth, and adults.
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit
CSA disclosures have the potential to facilitate earlier disclo-
sures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and
potentially prevent further sexual victimization. Increased
knowledge on both the factors and the processes involved in
CSA disclosures is timely when research continues to show
high rates of delayed disclosures (Collin-Ve
´zina, Sablonni,
Palmer, & Milne, 2015; Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, & Romito,
2004; Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman,
Jones, & Gordon, 2003; Hershkowitz, Lanes, & Lamb; 2007;
Jonzon & Lindblad, 2004; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al.,
2000).
Incidence studies in the United States and Canada report
decreasing CSA rates (Fallon et al., 2015; Finkelhor, Shattuck,
Turner, & Hamby, 2014; Trocme
´ et al., 2005, 2008), while at
the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of
18­20% for females and of 8­10% for males (Pereda, Guilera,
Forns, & Go
´mez-Benito, 2009). The highest rates found for
girls is in Australia (21.5%) and for boys in Africa (19.3%),
with the lowest rates for both girls (11.3%) and boys (4.1%)
reported in Asia (Stoltenborgh, van IJzendoorn, Euser, &
Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2011). These findings point to the
incongruence between the low number of official reports of

CSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence
studies. For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Stolten-
borgh, van IJzendoorn, Euser, and Bakermans-Kranenburg
(2011) combining estimations of CSA in 217 studies published
between 1980 and 2008 revealed rates of CSA to be more than
30 times greater in studies relying on self-reports (127 in 1,000)
than in official report inquiries, such as those based on data
from child protection services and the police (4 in 1,000) (Jil-
lian, Cotter, & Perreault, 2014; Statistics Canada 2013). In
other words, while 1 out of 8 people retrospectively report
having experienced CSA, official incidence estimates indicate
only 1 per 250 children. In a survey of Swiss child services,
Maier, Mohler-Kuo, Landholt, Schnyder, and Jud (2013) fur-
ther found 2.68 cases per 1,000 of CSA disclosures, while in a
recent comprehensive review McElvaney (2015) details the
high prevalence of delayed, partial, and nondisclosures in
childhood indicating a persistent trend toward withholding
CSA disclosure.
It is our view that incidence statistics are likely an under-
estimation of CSA disclosures, and this drives the rationale for
the current review. Given the persistence of delayed disclosures
with research showing a large number of survivors only dis-
closing in adulthood (Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Easton, 2013;
Hunter, 2011; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 2000), these
issues should be a concern for practitioners, policy makers, and
the general public (McElvaney, 2015). The longer disclosures
are delayed, the longer individuals potentially live with serious
negative effects and mental health problems such as depres-
sion, anxiety, trauma disorders, and addictions, without receiv-
ing necessary treatment. This also increases the likelihood of
more victims falling prey to undetected offenders. Learning
more about CSA disclosure factors and processes to help
advance our knowledge base may help professionals to facil-
itate earlier disclosures.
Previous literature reviews examining factors influencing
CSA disclosure have served the field well but are no longer
current. Important contributions on CSA disclosures include
Paine and Hansen's (2002) original review covering the liter-
ature largely from the premillennium era, followed by London,
Bruck, Ceci, and Shuman's (2005) subsequent review, which
may not have captured publications affected by "lag to print"
delays so common in peer-reviewed journals. These reviews
are now dated and therefore do not take into account the
plethora of research that has been accumulated over the past
15 years. Other recent reviews exist but with distinct contribu-
tions on the dialogical relational processes of disclosure (Reit-
sema & Grietens, 2015), CSA disclosures in adulthood (Tener
& Murphy, 2015), and delayed disclosures in childhood (McEl-
vaney, 2015). This literature review differs by focusing on CSA
disclosures in children, youth, and adults from childhood and
into adulthood--over the life course.
Method
Kiteley and Stogdon's (2014) systematic review framework
was utilized to establish what has been investigated in CSA
disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-
light the most convincing findings that should be considered for
future research, practice, and program planning. This review
centered on the question: What is the state of CSA disclosure
research and what can be learned to apply to future research
and practice? By way of clarification, the term systematic
refers to a methodologically sound strategy for searching liter-
ature on studies for knowledge construction, in this case the
CSA disclosure literature, rather than intervention studies. The
years spanned for searching the literature were 2000­2016,
building on previous reviews without a great deal of overlap.
Retrieval of relevant research was done by searching interna-
tional electronic databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Edu-
cational Resources Information Center, Canadian Research
Index, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Pub-
lished International Literature on Traumatic Stress, Sociologi-
cal Abstracts, Social Service Abstracts, and Applied Social
Science Index and Abstracts. This review searched peer-
reviewed studies. A search of the gray literature (unpublished
literature such as internal agency documents, government
reports, etc.) was beyond the scope of this review because
unpublished studies are not subjected to a peer-review process.
Keyword search terms used were child sexual abuse, childhood
sexual abuse, disclosure, and telling.
A search of the 9 databases produced 322 peer-reviewed
articles. Selected search terms yielded 200 English publica-
tions, 1 French study, and 1 Portuguese review. The search was
further refined by excluding studies focusing on forensic inves-
tigations, as these studies constitute a specialized legal focus on
interview approaches and techniques. As well, papers that
focused exclusively on rates and responses to CSA disclosure
were excluded, as these are substantial areas unto themselves,
exceeding the aims of the review question. Review articles
were also excluded. Once the exclusion criteria were applied,
the search results yielded 33 articles. These studies were sub-
jected to a thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke
(2006). This entailed (1) multiple readings by the three authors;
(2) identifying patterns across studies by coding and charting
specific features; (3) examining disclosure definitions used,
sample characteristics, and measures utilized; and (4) major
findings were extrapolated. Reading of the articles was initially
conducted by the authors to identify general trends in a first
level of analyses and then subsequently to identify themes
through a deeper second-level analyses. A table of studies was
generated and was continuously revised as the selection of
studies was refined (see Table 1).
Key Findings
First-level analysis of the studies identified key study charac-
teristics. Trends emerged around definitions of CSA disclosure,
study designs, and sampling issues. First, in regard to defini-
tions, the term "telling" is most frequently used in place of the
term disclosure. In the absence of standardized questionnaires
or disclosure instruments, telling emerges as a practical term
more readily understood by study participants. Several

The majority of the men in the study waited
until adulthood to disclose their abuse,
with negative stereotypes contributing
to their delayed disclosures. Negative
stereotypes contributed to delayed
disclosure with trying to forget. Breaking
isolation was cited as a motivator to
disclosure along with the aid of various
forms of media on disclosure. Important
contextual issues such as negative
stereotyping of males, sexuality, and
victims were noted. Social media was
seen as a facilitator of disclosures

contrary, extrafamilial disclosures take

Vast majority of participants (94.6%) were

Duration of sexual abuse broke down
into: 30.2% less than 6 months, 32.3% 6
months to 3 years, and 34.3% more than
3 years. Ten years old was average age of
CSA onset. Ten categories of barriers
were classified into three domains: (1)
sociopolitical: masculinity, limited
resources; (2) interpersonal: mistrust of
others, fear of being labeled "gay," safety
and protection issues, past responses;
and (3) personal: internal emotions,
seeing the experience as sexual abuse,
and sexual orientation.
At time of the study, this was the
largest qualitative data set to have
been analyzed with an explicit
focus on adult male survivors'
perceptions of barriers to CSA
disclosure. Because the sample
was limited in terms of the low
percentage of racial minorities
(9.3%), disclosure differences
based on race or ethnicity were
not discerned. The majority of
abuse reported was by clergy

of barriers to disclosure

Purposive sampling of
487 men from three
national organizations
devoted to raising
awareness of CSA
among men. Age
range: 19­84 years.
Mean age for onset of
CSA was 10.3 years
Older age and being abused by a family
member were both related to delays in
disclosure. Most participants who told
someone during childhood did not
receive emotionally supportive or
protective responses and the helpfulness
of responses across the life span was
mixed. Delays in telling were significant
periods of time (over 20 years).
Approximately one half of the
participants first told about the sexual
abuse to a spouse/partner (27%) or a
mental health professional (20%); 42% of
participants reported that their most
helpful discussion was with a mental
health professional. However, unhelpful
responses caused most mental distress.

Participants needed to have
access to Internet which would
have eliminated men in lower SES

consisted of 22
participants aged 25­

and 9 men. Participants
were sexually abused
at 15 years or under
with someone over

Only 5 out of 22 participants told anyone
about their early sexual experiences as

were the main inhibitors to disclosure.
These factors are further detailed
through subthemes. Telling as a child and
as an adult was further expanded upon

method of analysis
191 interviews of CSA
victims aged 3­18 over
a 1-year period were
used for the study.
Inclusion criteria
included children who
made a statement
about CSA prior to
referral, reasons for
telling or waiting to
tell, and those who
spoke English.
Participants were
children who were
interviewed at a child
sexual abuse clinic.
74% were female and
51% were Caucasian
Reasons the children identified for telling
were classified into three domains: (1)
disclosure as a result of internal stimuli
(e.g., the child had nightmares); (2)
disclosure facilitated by outside
influences (e.g., the child was
questioned); and (3) disclosure due to
direct evidence of abuse (e.g., the child's
abuse was witnessed). The barriers to
disclosure identified fell into five groups:
(1) threats made by the perpetrator
(e.g., the child was told she or he would
get in trouble if she or he told), (2) fears
(e.g., the child was afraid something bad
would happen if she or he told), (3) lack
of opportunity (e.g., the child felt the
opportunity to disclose never
presented), (4) lack of understanding
(e.g., the child failed to recognize abusive
behavior as unacceptable), and (5)
relationship with the perpetrator (e.g.,
the child thought the perpetrator was a
friend)

if formal investigative interviews

question: What
individual,
interpersonal,
environmental, and
contextual influences
impede or promote
CSA disclosures.
A qualitative
phenomenological
design, LIM, was used
to interview adult CSA
survivors about their
disclosure experiences
to provide
retrospective accounts
of CSA disclosure and
meaning-making of
these experiences.
Thematic analysis was
done through a social­
ecological lens.
Purposive sampling was
employed. Snowball
sampling was also used
to recruit more male
survivors. 40 adult
survivors of CSA were
interviewed: 36% men
and 64% women. Age
range of 18­65 with a
mean age of 40.1 years.
Average age of abuse
onset was 5.3 years
old. 36% of the sample
was non-White.
Diverse
socioeconomic
backgrounds
Themes fell into four domains: (1)
individual and developmental factors,
developmental factors as to whether
they comprehended what was
happening, personality traits also had
some bearing on their ability to tell, and
anticipating not being believed; (2)
disclosure inhibited by family
characteristics such as rigidly fixed
gender roles with dominating fathers,
chaos and aggression, other forms of
child abuse, domestic violence,
dysfunctional communication, and social
isolation; (3) neighborhood and
community context, that is, lack of
interest from neighbors and teachers not
pursuing troubling behavior; and (4)
cultural and societal attitudes, media
messages and societal attitudes, feeling
unheard as kids, gender socialization for
males, and cultural attitudes influencing
parent's reactions. Purposeful disclosure
is higher than reported in other studies
because of the sampling attempts to
purposefully locate disclosers
The study presents a comprehensive
social­ecological analysis to CSA
disclosure highlighting the
multifaceted influences. Of note,
42% had disclosed the abuse
during childhood; 26% had not
disclosed because they had
repressed the memory, or the
abuse had occurred in preschool
years and they had difficulty with
recall. The remainder had
attempted some form of
disclosure in indirect ways during
childhood. A retrospective
approach that could be affected by

This examination of CSA
disclosure explored
the ways culture
affects processes of
CSA disclosure and
reporting, both in the
United States and
internationally
Using published literature
with clinical data, this
article conducted an
analysis to provide a
culturally competent
framework for CSA
disclosure questioning
Data consisted of
published literature on
disclosure and culture
that was triangulated
with clinical case
material
Cultural and structural factors affecting
CSA disclosure are identified in in-depth
detail. Recommendations made include
(1) disclosure interviewing should be
tailored to the child's cultural context,
(2) questioning should also take into
consideration age and gender factors,
and (3) culture stands as an important
factor in all cases in which children are
considering disclosing or being asked to
disclose, and not solely in cases in which
children are from noticeable minority
groups. Presents a comprehensive
interview framework integrating cultural
considerations
One of the few works that adds
knowledge to culturally
contextual disclosure
interviewing. Unique combination
of literature findings with clinical
material. Anecdotal accounts may
preclude transferability of
findings. Overall adds to an
impoverished area of CSA
disclosure information

Findings suggest high rates of hidden abuse,
with less than one quarter of youth
reporting a disclosure. 244 of the 1,099
youth who disclosed abuse on their
evaluation forms identified specific
individuals they told about their abuse.
Disclosure patterns vary with boys,
youth aged 14­15, victims of physical
abuse, and those abused by a family
member being most likely to disclose to
professionals or the police. One third of
disclosures were directed toward
professionals and the least, 5% percent
each, were directed toward friends,
parents, and others. Participants were
most likely to disclose sexual abuse to
parents/family, professionals, and the
police/courts, with fewer choosing
friends.
Out of all 1,099 participants, 225 males and
779 females indicated that they had been
abused. Out of those, 43 males and 180
females indicated that they had disclosed
the abuse. Of those who had disclosed,

Priebe and Svedin (2008) This study aimed to
investigate disclosure
rates and disclosure
patterns and examine
predictors of
nondisclosure in a
sample of male and
female adolescents
with self-reported
experiences of sexual
abuse
Participants completed
65-item questionnaire
that included questions
about background,
consensual sex, sexual
abuse experiences
(noncontact, contact
or penetrating abuse,
including peer abuse),
disclosure of CSA,
own sexual abusive
behavior, sexual
attitudes, and
experiences with
pornography and
sexual exploitation.
The questionnaire
included 6 modified
items from the SCL-90
and 9 of 25 items from
the Parental Bonding
Instrument. The data
for girls and boys were
analyzed separately
The sample consisted of
4,339 high school
students in Sweden
(2,324 girls and 2,015
boys). The mean age of
the participants was
18.15 years. This study
used a subsample of
1,962 participants who
reported CSA and
who answered
disclosure questions
Of the sample, 1,505 girls (65%) and 457
boys (23%) reported CSA. The
disclosure rate was 81% (girls) and 69%
(boys). Girls and boys disclosed most
often to a friend of their own age. Few
had disclosed to professionals, and even
fewer had reported to the authorities.
There were higher rates of disclosure to
a professional with more severe abuse
(contact abuse with or without
penetration) for girls, but lower rates for
boys The more severe the sexual abuse
was, the less likely both girls and boys
had talked to their mother, father, or a
sibling. Girls were less likely to disclose if
they had experienced contact sexual
abuse with or without penetration, less
frequent abuse, abuse by a family
member, or if they had perceived their
parents as less caring and less
overprotective and highly
overprotective. Boys were less likely to
disclose if a family member abused them,
they were studying a vocational program
(vs. an academic program), lived with
both parents or had perceived their
parents as less caring and not
overprotective.
Adolescents who reported CSA perceived
their mental health as poorer compared
to adolescents without CSA.
Nondisclosers reported more
symptoms on the Mental Health Scale
than those who had disclosed
This study highlighted that sexual
abuse is largely hidden from adult
society, especially from
professionals and the legal system.
However, time lapsed to
disclosure was not reported.
Since friends appeared to be the
main recipients of sexual abuse
disclosures, practice implications
of this could be to find ways to
give young people better
information and guidance about
how to support a sexually abused
peer. A qualitative component to
the study would have provided a
broader understanding of
disclosure processes. Study
limitations include a significant
amount of boys who did not
complete the questions regarding
disclosure on; the timing of
disclosures (whether they were
delayed or not) was not
measured; possibility of recall bias
with retrospective studies based
on self-reports; and youth
participants may not have
understood all the questions

Only 1 of the 16 men in this sample
disclosed the full extent of his sexual
abuse experiences while he was still a
child. The other men reported that they
had not disclosed, although some
reported attempts to tell that were
indirect or incomplete. Several other
men disclosed certain experiences or
elements of their abuse, but concealed
others. By the time of the study, many of
these men had disclosed their past
experiences in a variety of relationships,
including those with family members,
partners, therapists, and infrequently
friends. Several had only limited
discussions of their sexual abuse
readily. Retrospective accounts
are subject to recall issues.

Alleged victims of sexual
abuse and their
parents were

Protocol by

investigators.
Information on

was obtained in the
first formal interview,
before any police
investigation or child
welfare intervention
Thirty alleged victims of
CSA; 18 boys and 12
girls. Child sample was
7- to 12-year-olds with
an average age of 9.2
years. Twenty mothers
and 10 fathers were
also interviewed for a
total of 30 parent
interviews. A content
analysis was conducted
on child and parent
interviews
Disclosure categories were identified as
follows: (1) delayed 53% of the children
delayed disclosure for between 1 week
and 2 years; (2) recipient of disclosure:
47% of children first disclosed to siblings
or friends, 43% first disclosed to their
parents, and 10% first disclosed to
another adult. 57% of the children
spontaneously disclosed abuse, but 43%
disclosed only after they were
prompted. 50% of the children reported
feeling afraid or ashamed of their
parents' responses. Parents' reactions:
supportive (37%) and unsupportive
(63%). There was a strong correlation
between predicted and actual parental
reactions suggesting children anticipated
their parents' likely reactions accurately.
Disclosure processes varied depending
on the children's ages (e.g., younger
children disclosed to parents), severity
and frequency of abuse, parents'
expected reactions, suspects' identities,
and strategies used to foster secrecy

Study Purpose Design Sample Findings Summary
Alaggia and Kirshenbaum
(2005)
The objectives of the
current study were to
identify a broad range
of factors, including
family dynamics that
contribute to or
hinder a child's ability
to disclose CSA.
A qualitative
phenomenological
design--LIM--was
used to elicit
disclosure
experiences;
facilitators and
barriers; and relevant
circumstances.
Interviews were
transcribed verbatim.
Line-by-line open
coding was conducted
to capture family-level
factors. Axial and
selective coding
facilitated
identification of
themes
Purposive sampling was
employed to recruit 20
adult survivors
between the ages of 18
and 65 who were
sexually abused by a
family member.
Average age of
participants was 40.1
years; 60% of
participants were
female and 40% male.
Average age of onset
of abuse was 6.7 years.
Mixed clinical and
nonclinical sample. The
majority had received
treatment for CSA at
some point in their
lives
Four major themes emerged suggesting
that CSA disclosure can be significantly
compromised when certain family
conditions exist: (1) rigidly fixed, gender
roles based on a patriarchy-based family
structure; (2) presence of family
violence; (3) closed, indirect family
communication patterns; and (4) social
isolation of the family as a whole, or
specific members, played a part in CSA
victims feeling they had no one safe to
tell. Family systems formulations through
a feminist lens are important in
understanding children and families at
risk of disclosure barriers
Over half the participants had not
disclosed the abuse during
childhood. Of the nondisclosing
participants, six did not disclose
because they had repressed or
forgotten the memory. Almost
one third withheld disclosure
intentionally. More data are
needed on early disclosures to
garner more information on
facilitators of disclosure.
Retrospective approach implies
recall issues. High level of
trustworthiness of the data and
interpretations were achieved
through credibility, dependability,
and confirmability through direct
quotes
Alaggia (2005) The study purpose was
to qualitatively explore
dynamics that impede
or promote disclosure
by examining a range of
factors including
gender as a dynamic--
how disclosures of
females and males are
similar and different,
and in what ways
gender affects CSA
disclosure
Survivors of CSA were
interviewed about
their disclosure
experiences using LIM.
Analysis of 30
participant narratives
was used for theme
development regarding
impact of gender on
disclosure. Interviews
were transcribed
verbatim for open,
axial, and selective
coding. Categories and
subcategories were
collapsed and refining
into theme areas
Purposive sampling of
women and men, along
with those who
disclosed during the
abuse and those who
did not. 19 females and
11 males; 18­65 (mean
40.1) years who were
sexually abused by a
family member or a
trusted adult. Average
age of abuse onset was
5.3 years, 36% were
nonwhite, and 58% had
not disclosed during
childhood
Three themes emerged for men that
inhibited or precipitated disclosure for
reasons related to gender: (1) fear of
being viewed as homosexual; (2)
profound feelings of stigmatization or
isolation because of the belief that boys
are rarely victimized; and (3) fear of
becoming an abuser, which acted as a
precipitant for disclosure. Two
predominant themes with female
participants related to difficulties
disclosing: (1) they felt more conflicted
about who was responsible for the abuse
and (2) they more strongly anticipated
being blamed and/or not believed

independently predicted by victim's age,
nature of the victim­perpetrator
relationship, offender's age, frequency of
abuse, and reporting latency. Mean age of
purposeful disclosures (10.67) was
higher than the mean age of indirect
disclosures (5.84). Explicit forms of
disclosure were less likely when the
offender was a family member. Shorter
reporting latency was more likely with
repeated abuse
with the percentage of interrater
agreement at 98%.
Generalizability of this study is
limited to child clients receiving a
crisis assessment referred
through a police report
Hershkowitz, Horowitz,
and Lamb (2005).
This study aimed to
identify characteristics
of suspected child
abuse victims that are
associated with
disclosure and
nondisclosure during
formal investigations
Large database of
suspected cases of
physical and sexual
abuse investigated in
Israel between 1998
and 2002 was analyzed.
Interviews were also
conducted using
standardized NICHD
Investigative Interview
Protocol. Archival data
were analyzed
The sample was
comprised of 26,446 of
3- to 14-year-old
alleged victims of
sexual and physical
abuse interviewed in
Israel in the 5-year
period from 1998 to
2002. 140 experienced
trained youth
investigators
conducted interviews
Overall, 65% of the 26,446 children made
allegations when interviewed. Rates of
disclosure were greater for sexual abuse
(71%) over physical abuse (61%).
Children of all ages were less likely to
disclose/allege abuse when a parent was
the suspected perpetrator. Disclosure
rates increased as children grew older:
50% with 3- to 6-year-olds, 67% of the 7-
to 10-year-olds, and 74% of the 11- to
14-year-olds disclosed abuse when
questioned
Overall findings indicated that rates
of disclosure varied systematically
depending on the nature of the
alleged offences, the relationship
between alleged victims and
suspected perpetrators, and the
age of the suspected victims.
Analyses only involved cases that
had come to the attention of
official agencies, making it difficult
to determine how many of abuse
take place without ever triggering
any kind of official investigation
Jensen, Gulbrandsen,
Mossige, Reichelt, and
Tjersland (2005)
This study investigated
the context in which
children were able to
report their child
sexual abuse
experiences; their
views as to what made
it difficult to talk about
abuse; what helped
them in the disclosing
process; and their
parent's perceptions of
their disclosure
processes
Qualitative approach to
data collection and
analysis was used.
Therapeutic interviews
o the children and
mostly their mothers
were analyzed through
a qualitative approach.
Follow-up interviews
were held 1 year later
20 families with a total of
22 children
participated. All
children had told about
experiences that
created concerns for
care-givers about CSA.
Children's ages ranged
between 3 and 16
years (average age 7.5
years); 15 girls and 7
boys. Sexually abused
by someone in the
family or a close
person to the family
None of the children told of abuse
immediately after it occurred. Children
exposed to repetitive abuse kept this as a
secret for up to several years; 17 told
their mothers first, 3 first told a friend, 1
told their father, and 1 their uncle.
Majority of remarks that led to the
suspicion of CSA were made in
situations where someone engaged the
child in a dialogue about what was
bothering them, resulting in a referral.
The children felt it was difficult to find
situations containing enough privacy and
prompts that they could share their
experiences. When the children did
Evidence for delayed disclosures.
The results indicate that
disclosure is a fundamentally
dialogical process that becomes
less difficult if children perceive
that there is an opportunity to
talk, a purpose for speaking and a
connection has been established
to what they are talking about.

relationships is an important

disclose they did it in situations where
the topic of child sexual abuse was in
some form addressed or activated,
where someone recognized the child's
cues and probed further. They also were
sensitive to others reactions, and
whether their disclosures would be
misinterpreted. Several of the children
perceived negative consequences as
major factors contributing to delaying
disclosure. They were primarily
concerned about negative effects for the
mother. The mothers said they were
also sensitive to the children's feelings. If
their children showed signs of distress
and did not want to talk, the mothers
would change the subject or not pursue
the topic further

consisted of four focus
groups conducted

Sample consisted of 34
participants from four
groups. Sessions
analyzed were
between 60 and 90 min
long; audiotaped and
later transcribed for
content analysis
Findings are reported in three major
domains: (1) self-phase: where children
come to understand victimization
internally; (2) confidant selection-
reaction phase: where they select a time,
place, and person to tell and then
whether that person's reaction was
supportive or hostile; and (3)
consequences phase: good and bad that
continued to inform their ongoing
strategies of telling. The actions and
reactions of adults were significant and
informed the girls' decisions. The
consequences phase was further
subdivided into four aspects: (1)
gossiping and news networks, (2)
changing relationships, (3) institutional
responses and the afterlife of telling, and
(4) insider and outsider communities
This study provided a contextual
examination of the entire
disclosure process, closer to the
point in time when the abuse and
disclosure occurred. Small groups
of preadolescent and adolescent
girls who had survived sexual
abuse also served as consultants
and were encouraged to share
their knowledge for the benefit of
professional practitioners
Alaggia (2004) The study sought to

impediments that
prevent adolescents
from disclosing CSA

the interviews which
were recorded with
permission. Three

The sample was
comprised of 36 young
people who
experienced sexual
abuse in adolescence;
35 females and 1 male;
aged 12­17. Some of
the sample
experienced sexual
violence in a dating
relationship
The main impediments to disclose to a
family member were: fear of not being
believed, shame, and fear of causing
trouble to the family. The main
impediments for not seeking services
were: unaware of appropriate services,
wish to keep the secret, lack of
awareness of being abused, mistrust of
adults and professionals, and fear of the
consequences of disclosing sexual abuse.
When they did disclose to professionals,
teens received very limited support as
many professionals were not trained on
sexual abuse and could not offer
appropriate interventions to victims
This study represented the findings
of a mixed sample of survivors of
child sexual abuse and intimate
partner violence. The study was
conducted in Italy and it is not
clear what sexual abuse response
training is available. There may
have been a selection bias as the

Abuse characteristics: abuse by multiple
perpetrators was more common than by
a single perpetrator. Age of onset was
often before age of 7, with an average
duration of 7 years. Severely abused
women had talked to more of their
social network, especially to
professionals. Disclosures: 32%
disclosed during childhood (before the
age of 18) with an average of 21 years
delay. Women who had disclosed in
childhood reported more instances of
physical abuse, multiple perpetrators,
use of violence, and were more likely to
have confronted a perpetrator, and had
received a negative first reaction. Factors
68% delayed disclosure until
adulthood. At the time of the
study, it was one of the first
studies to focus on the interplay
between social support networks
and disclosure of child sexual
abuse. The study results are
somewhat limited by an
overrepresentation of severely
abused women. Retrospective
study and self-report of
information could imply recall
issues and thus limits the accuracy
of the information obtained on
abuse and disclosure
characteristics. Cross-sectional

Data were gathered from
a subsample of female

of structured phone

characteristics, and
family contextual
attributes were
explored
Children under the age of 7 were at a
higher risk for delayed disclosures.
Participants whose USE occurred
between the ages of 7 and 13 were most
likely to tell an adult. Adolescents (14­
17) were more likely to tell only peers
than children aged 7­10 years. Children
under 11 were more likely to tell an
adult, but were at risk for delaying
disclosure beyond a month. Children
aged 11­13 tended to disclose within a
month. Closer relationship to the
perpetrator or a family member was
associated with delayed disclosure.
Immediate disclosure was more likely
with stranger perpetration. Fear for
one's life during and penetration were
associated with disclosure to adults.
Family factors linked to disclosure were
(1) drug abusing household member,
which made survivors more likely to
disclose more promptly and (2) never
living with both parents was associated
with nondisclosure
This study examined factors
including disclosures of USEs in
childhood and adolescence in a
nationally representative sample
of female adolescents who
participated in the NSA. Surveys
for investigations of victimization
experiences may be biased due to
underreporting. Adolescents who
refused to report or discuss an
USE may represent a source of
systematic bias and would make
the results generalizable only to
adolescents who are willing to
disclose USE via survey. Although
data may be retrospective, recall
bias may have been minimized in
this study since participants were
adolescents, and so the time lag
between the USE and the
interview were presumably
shorter than a study of adult
participants recalling CSA
experiences

288 (9%) reported experiencing at least
one event that met the study's definition
of childhood rape. The average age at the
time of the first rape was 10.9 years. Of
the 288 women who reported a child
rape, 28% stated that they had never told
anyone about this sexual assault until
specifically queried by the interviewer
for this study. 58% did not disclose for
over 1 year and up to 5 years post-rape.
27% disclosed within a month. Among
women who disclosed prior to their
NWS interview close friends were the
most common person to whom victims
made disclosures, followed by mothers
and other immediate family members.
Fewer than 10% of victims reported
making their initial disclosure to social
workers or law enforcement personnel.
Only 12% of child rape victims stated
that their assaults were reported to
authorities at some point
The time frame of this survey may
have had contextual implications.
The majority of child rapes
reported by this sample occurred
prior to the large-scale child
assault prevention education
programs that were begun in the
1980s that teach children that
assaults (including CSA) are
wrong and should be disclosed to
responsible adults. This
information may have influenced
(and may currently be influencing)
young women's disclosure
patterns. For Wave 1, comparison
of these data with the population
parameters obtained from the
U.S. Census Bureau indicated that
the sample closely matched the
demographic attributes of the
population of U.S. women

examples of this usage were found in the research questions,
interview guides, and surveys examined: "How and when do
people decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences
with adults?" (Hunter, 2011, p. 161); "Some men take many
years to tell someone that they were sexually abused. Please
describe why it may be difficult for men to tell about/discuss
the sexual abuse" (Easton, Saltzman, & Willis, 2014, p. 462).
"Participants were asked a series of open-ended questions to
elicit a narrative regarding their experiences of telling . . . "
(McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2012, p. 1160). "Who was the
first person you told?" (Schaeffer, Leventhal, & Anes, 2011, p.
346).
There was sound consistency between studies, defining dis-
closure in multifaceted ways with uniform use of categories of
prompted, purposeful, withheld, accidental, direct, and indi-
rect. However, defining the period of time that would delineate
a disclosure as delayed varied widely across studies, wherein
some studies viewed 1 week or 1 month as a delayed disclosure
(i.e., Hershkowitz et al., 2007; Kogan, 2004; Scho
¨nbucher,
Maier, Moher-Kuo, Schnyder, & Lamdolt, 2012). Other studies
simply reported average years of delay sometimes as long as
from 20 to 46 years (Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 2004;
Smith et al., 2000).
Second, the number of qualitative studies has increased sig-
nificantly over the last 15 years. This rise is in response to a
previous dearth of qualitative studies. Based on Jones's (2000)
observation that disclosure factors and outcomes had been well
documented through quantitative methods; in a widely read
editorial, he recommended "Qualitative studies which are able
to track the individual experiences of children and their percep-
tion of the influences upon them which led to their disclosure of
information are needed to complement . . . " (p. 270).
Third, although a few studies strived to obtain representative
samples in quantitative investigations (Hershkowitz, Horowitz,
& Lamb, 2005; Kogan, 2004; Smith et al., 2000), sampling was
for the most part convenience based, relying on voluntary par-
ticipation in surveys and consent-based participation in file
reviews (Collings, Griffiths, & Kumalo, 2005; Priebe & Sve-
din, 2008; Scho
¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar, Barter, McConnell,
Tutty, & Fairholm, 2009a). Therefore, generalizability of find-
ings is understandably limited. The qualitative studies used
purposive sampling as is deemed appropriate for transferability
of findings to similar populations. Some of those samples con-
tained unique characteristics, since they were sought through
counseling centers or sexual advocacy groups. These would be
considered clinical samples producing results based on disclo-
sures that may have been delayed or problematic. This might
presumably produce data skewed toward barriers and bring
forward less information on disclosure facilitators.
Through an in-depth, second-level analysis, this review
identified five distinct themes and subthemes beyond the gen-
eral trends as noted earlier.
Theme 1: Disclosure is viewed as an ongoing process as
opposed to a discrete event--iterative and interactive in
nature. A subtheme was identified regarding disclosure as
being facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is
being more clearly delineated.
Theme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a social­
ecological, person-in-environment perspective to under-
stand the complex interplay of individual, familial, contex-
tual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure.
Subthemes include new categories of disclosure and a grow-
ing focus on previously missing cultural and contextual
factors.
Theme 3: Age and gender are strong predictors for delaying
disclosure or withholding disclosure with trends showing
fewer disclosures by younger children and boys. One sub-
theme emerged that intrafamilial abuse/family-like relation-
ship of perpetrator has a bearing on disclosure delays or
withholding.
Theme 4: There is a lack of a cohesive life-course perspec-
tive. One subtheme includes the lack of data within the 18-
to 24-year-old emerging adult population.
Theme 5: Significantly more information is available on
barriers than on facilitators of CSA disclosure. Subthemes
of shame, self-blame, and fear are uniformly identified as
disclosure deterrents.
Disclosure as an ongoing process: Iterative and interactive in nature.
Disclosure is now generally accepted as a complex and lifelong
process, with current trends showing that CSA disclosures are
too often delayed until adulthood (Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015;
Easton, 2013; Hunter, 2011). Knowledge building about CSA
disclosure has moved in the direction of understanding this as
an iterative and interactive process rather than a discrete, one-
time event. Since the new millennium, disclosure is being
viewed as a dynamic, rather than static, process and described
"not as a single event but rather a carefully measured process"
(Alaggia, 2005, p. 455). The catalyst for this view originates
from Summit (1983) who initially conceptualized CSA disclo-
sures as process based, although this notion was not fully
explored until several years later. Examinations of Summit's
(1983) groundbreaking proposition of the CSA accommodation
(CSAA) model produced varying results as to whether his five
stages of secrecy, helplessness, entrapment and accommoda-
tion, delayed, conflicted, and unconvincing disclosures, and
retraction or recantation, hold validity (for a review, see Lon-
don, Bruck, Ceci, & Shuman, 2005). However, the idea of
disclosure as a process has been carried over into contemporary
thinking.
Recently, McElvaney, Greene, and Hogan (2012) detailed a
process model of disclosure wherein they describe an interac-
tion of internal factors with external motivators which they
liken to a "pressure cooker" effect, preceded by a period of
containment of the secret. Moreover, this and other studies
strongly suggest disclosures are more likely to occur within a
dialogical context--activated by discussions of abuse or pre-
vention forums providing information about sexual abuse
(Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Jensen, Gulbrandsen, Mossige,
Reichelt, & Tjersland, 2005; Ungar et al., 2009a). The term
Alaggia et al. 17
dialogical simply means to participate in dialogue. Key dialo-
gical vehicles identified in these studies were providing sexual
abuse information through prevention programs, being asked
about sexual abuse, and being prompted to tell (McElvaney
et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009a).
Contemporary models of CSA disclosure reflect a social-ecological
perspective. Knowledge on CSA disclosure has been steadily
advancing toward a holistic understanding of the complex
interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural fac-
tors (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Brazelton, 2015; Fontes
& Plummer, 2010). Where at one time factors examined and
identified were predominantly of intrapersonal factors of child
victims, knowledge construction has shifted to fuller social­
ecological, person-in-environment explanations (Alaggia,
2010; Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Easton et al., 2014; Hunter,
2011; Ungar, Tutty, McConnell, Barter, & Fairholm, 2009b).
Social­ecological explanations open up more opportunities to
intervene in facilitating earlier disclosures. Alaggia (2010) pro-
poses an ecological mapping of what individual, interpersonal,
environmental, and contextual influences impede or promote
CSA disclosures based on analysis of in-depth interview data of
40 adult survivors. Subsequently, based on a sample of 67 adult
survivors, Collin-Ve
´zina, Sablonni, Palmer, and Milne (2015)
identified three broad categories, closely aligned with an eco-
logical framework that impede CSA disclosure: (1) barriers
from within, (2) barriers in relation to others, and (3) barriers
in relation to the social world which can be aligned to intra-
personal, interpersonal, and contextual factors.
A summary of knowledge building using a social­ecologi-
cal framework follows. Knowledge gained in the intrapersonal
domain includes expanded conceptualization of disclosure by
building on previous categories of accidental, purposeful, and
prompted disclosure to also include behavioral and indirect
attempts to tell, intentionally withheld disclosure, and triggered
and recovered memories (Alaggia, 2004). Categories of indi-
rect behavioral disclosure patterns have been further verified in
follow-up research by Hunter (2011), and through an extensive
file review that used Alaggia's (2004) disclosure framework to
analyze their data (Collings et al., 2005) for verification.
Interpersonal factors have also emerged in regard to certain
family characteristics as disclosure barriers. Families with
rigidly fixed gender roles, patriarchal attitudes, power imbal-
ances, other forms of child abuse and domestic violence, chao-
tic family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social
isolation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia &
Kirshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Fontes &
Plummer, 2010). In addition, relationship with perpetrator is
a factor whereby research indicates that disclosure is made
more difficult when the perpetrator is a family member or close
to the family (Dumont, Messerschmitt, Vila, Bohu, & Rey-
Salmon, 2014;Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003;
Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Scho
¨nbucher
et al., 2012). This is especially a barrier when the perpetrator
lives with the victim (LeClerc & Wortley, 2015).
In terms of environmental factors, one study revealed that
neighborhood/community conditions can hinder disclosure
when there is lack of school involvement in providing a sup-
portive environment, such as in following up on troubling stu-
dent behavior (Alaggia, 2010). Additionally, a child victim's
anticipation of a negative response to disclosure, especially that
they may not be believed by others outside their family such as
neighbors or other community members, has shown to deter
disclosure (Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015).
Cultural factors influencing CSA disclosure have been stud-
ied to a much lesser degree. Despite this, a few important
studies examining critical sociocultural factors now exist for
better understanding CSA disclosure within a cultural context
(Brazelton, 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Among these
important contributions, Brazelton's (2015) research has deli-
neated CSA disclosure processes as "shaped by relational,
racial, socio-cultural, historical, and developmental factors"
(p. 182). In a unique study using culturally focused research
literature as data triangulated with clinical case material, cul-
turally based belief systems in many cultures have been found
to foster family climates that can silence children from disclos-
ing abuse (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Taboos about sexuality,
patriarchal attitudes, and devaluation of women are among
some of the cultural barriers that inhibit disclosure (Fontes &
Plummer, 2010).
Clearly, disclosure conceptualizations are being integrated
into a social­ecological model of individual and developmental
factors, family dynamics, neighborhood, and community con-
text as well as cultural and societal attitudes toward better
understanding disclosure barriers and facilitators (Alaggia,
2010), although more data are needed on cultural and contex-
tual factors.
Age and gender as predictors of disclosure
Age. Age is consistently found to be an influential factor in
CSA disclosure, making the life stage of the victim/survivor a
critical consideration. Studies draw distinctions in age-groups
falling into either under or over 18 years of age. Eighteen years
of age was the common age cutoff point that investigators chose
in order to distinguish child/youth populations from adult sam-
ples. Sixteen of the studies drew on samples of children and
youth, while the other 15 studies sampled adults over the age
of 18, and a further two studies used mixed age-groups (refer to
Table 1). Among the child and youth samples, the age ranges
spanned from preschool to late adolescence (3­17 years of age),
with varying methodological approaches implemented across
age cohorts. For younger cohorts, file reviews and secondary
data analyses of CSA reports were typically undertaken. Ado-
lescents were most often given surveys. Sometimes children and
youth were interviewed as part of administering a survey or as a
follow-up (Crisma et al., 2004; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Ungar
et al., 2009b). In the majority of child and adolescent samples,
sexual abuse concerns were already flagged to investigative
authorities. However, the work of Ungar, Barter, McConnell,
Tutty, and Fairholm (2009a, 2009b) is one exception, whereby
their survey elicited new disclosures.
18 TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE XX(X)
Adult studies typically had a mean age between 40 and 50
years. Interviews were the main data collection method with a
few exceptions using survey designs (i.e., Easton, 2013; Kogan,
2004; Smith et al., 2000) and case file reviews (i.e., Collings
et al., 2005; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003). Results show a clear
trend toward increased likelihood of disclosure in older youth,
and findings from adult samples showing a preponderance of
disclosures in adulthood, with the large majority of participants
of adults reporting never having had a sexual abuse complaint
filed with investigative authorities as a child or an adolescent
(i.e., Hunter, 2011; Gagnier & Collin-Ve
´zina, 2016; Sorsoli,
Kia-Keating, & Grossman, 2008; Ungar et al., 2009b).
With children and youth under the ages of 18 distinct
patterns emerged. First, accidental detection, rather than
purposeful disclosure, is more likely to occur with younger
children. For example, in one large-scale study of over
1,737 file reviews, over half of the CSA-related cases were
identified through accidental and eyewitness detection (61%),
while less than one third were purposeful disclosures initiated
by the child victim (Collings et al., 2005). A second pattern
which emerged is that rates of disclosure increase with age,
especially into adulthood, which is supported by persistent
findings of high rates of delayed disclosure reported later
in the life course by adult survivors (Collings et al., 2005;
Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015 ; Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad,
2004; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015; Sorsoli et al.,
2008). While gender and relationship with the perpetrator are
considerable factors in CSA disclosure, age is consistently a
stronger predictor of disclosure (or nondisclosure) (Hershko-
witz et al., 2005; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015). Third, younger
children who disclose are more likely to do so in an interview
situation or other environment that provides prompts or
questions about sexual abuse (Hershkowitz et al., 2005;
McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al.,
2011), but this trend can also be seen in older youth (Ungar
et al., 2009a, 2009b).
Gender. A number of studies have recently focused on CSA
disclosures with male victims, since males have been an under-
studied population (Alaggia, 2005; Easton, 2013; Easton et al.,
2014; Gagnier & Collin-Ve
´zina, 2016). Most investigations
that sampled both sexes show females outweighing male parti-
cipants. Although women are at double the risk of being sub-
jected to CSA, the ratio of women to men in most disclosure
studies has not been representative. This finding may be indi-
cative of male victims more likely delaying disclosing their
CSA experiences, leaving male disclosure in child and youth
samples underrepresented (He
´bert, Tourigny, Cyr, McDuff, &
Joly, 2009; Ungar et al., 2009b).
Easton, Saltzman, and Willis (2014) have been developing
gender-specific modeling of disclosure examining male disclo-
sures. Their proposed model groups male disclosures into barrier
categories as determined by individual factors, interpersonal
issues, and factors that are sociopolitical in nature. These authors
suggest that predominant gender norms around masculinity rein-
force the tendency for male victims of CSA to blame themselves
for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure. Male participants in a
subsequent study also relayed that gender norms and stereotypes
contributed to them concealing the abuse because they were
abused by a woman (Gagnier & Collin-Ve
´zina, 2016). In the one
study that compared male and female disclosures, investigator
found that men's fears of being viewed as homosexual; profound
feelings of stigmatization or isolation because of the belief that
boys are rarely victimized; and fear of becoming an abuser acted
asdisclosure barriers.Whereasfemalesfeltmoreconflictedabout
who was responsible for the abuse and more strongly anticipated
being blamed and not believed (Alaggia, 2005).
Lack of a life-course perspective. Given that the study of CSA
disclosure draws on age-groups ranging from samples of very
young children to retrospective studies of adult survivors, with
significant developmental considerations, this area of study
lacks an intentional cohesive life-course perspective. Most data
are derived from either cross-sectional or retrospective designs,
with few longitudinal studies. There are a series of sound, yet
disconnected, studies focusing on specific age-groups of chil-
dren and adolescents, along with adult retrospective studies.
Thus, the available knowledge base does not allow for a cohe-
sive picture of CSA disclosure processes and pathways over the
life course to emerge.
The life-course perspective has long been recommended as
a critical lens for the study of child abuse (Browning & Lau-
mann, 1997; Williams, 2003). For example, a life-course per-
spective has been utilized to understand the immediate- and
long-term effects of CSA on the developing child victim
(Browning & Laumann, 1997). Further, a life-course perspec-
tive is important in terms of examining age of onset of CSA to
explain the differential effects of sexual victimization and
developmental impacts in terms of understanding their ability
to disclose--effects that need to be understood within a devel-
opmental context, especially for designing appropriate inter-
ventions for disclosure at critical transitions from early
childhood through to adolescence and into adulthood. In addi-
tion, important "turning points" in life may facilitate disclo-
sures. For example, entry into adulthood given that delayed
disclosure occurs more often in adulthood. Alaggia (2004,
2005) found that being in a committed relationship or the birth
of children acted as facilitators for some survivors to disclose,
especially to their spouses. These significant life events, as
contributing to disclosures, bear further examination.
Summary of barriers and facilitators. Research over the past 15
years continues to uncover barriers to CSA disclosure at a
higher frequency than that of facilitators. As stated previously,
this might be the result of sampling methods whereby partici-
pants who volunteer for disclosure research may have had more
negative disclosure experiences, especially since many report
delays in disclosure. The following section outlines the major
trends in both barriers and facilitators (see Table 2).
Barriers. Age and gender were found to contribute to barriers
as covered in Theme 3. Disclosures generally increase with age
Alaggia et al. 19
as children gain more developmental capacity, understanding
of sexual abuse as victimization, and increased independence.
Males are somewhat less likely to disclose, but this is often in
interaction with other factors in the environment such as soci-
etal attitudes that promote hypermasculinity as desirable, atti-
tudes that perpetuate negative views of boys and men who are
victims, and homophobic attitudes (Alaggia, 2010; Easton
et al., 2014; Gagnier & Collin-Ve
´zina, 2016).
Victims of intrafamilial abuse when the offender is a parent,
caregiver, significant family member, or someone in a family-
like role are less likely to disclose immediately or at all in
childhood/adolescence because of obvious power differentials
and dependency needs (Collings et al., 2005; Dumont et al.,
2014; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wort-
ley, 2015; Paine & Hansen, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2011).
Further, the perpetrator residing with their victim(s)
increases the likelihood of no disclosure (Leclerc & Wortley,
2015).
Internalized victim-blaming, mechanisms to protect oneself
(such as minimizing the impact of the abuse), and developmen-
tal immaturity at the onset of abuse constituted internal bar-
riers. Further, shame, self-blame, and fear have been identified
as significant factors deterring disclosure (Collin-Ve
´zina et al.,
2015; Crisma et al., 2004; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; Hun-
ter, 2011; Kogan, 2004; McElvaney & Culhane, 2015; McEl-
vaney et al., 2014). However, aspects of shame, self-blame and
fear, and have not been fully explored in research. Since these
are strong predictors of disclosure suppression, they bear fur-
ther examination in future research to understand more fully
how they operate in disclosure processes.
In terms of interpersonal and environmental factors, family
dynamics can play a part in deterring disclosure. As previously
mentioned, families characterized by rigidly defined gender
roles, patriarchal attitudes that perpetuate power imbalances
between men and women, parents and children, presence of
other forms of child abuse and/or domestic violence, chaotic
family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social iso-
lation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia & Kir-
shenbaum, 2005; Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Fontes &
Plummer, 2010). In regard to broader environmental factors,
disclosure can be hindered when involved and supportive com-
munity members are not available, or not trained in sensitive
responses, or when child victims anticipate not being believed
by neighbors and other people outside the family (Alaggia,
2010; Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015). Further, barriers in relation
to the social world were identified as stigmatization, the neg-
ative labeling of sexual abuse victims, and taboos surrounding
sexuality and talking about sex as driven by cultural norms
(Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010).
Identification of cultural barriers is important recent contri-
bution to understanding disclosure processes--and in particular
to the obstacles. Findings related to cultural barriers included
themes of children's voices not being heard leading to silen-
cing, the normalization of the sexualization and objectification
of girls and women, and the perpetuation of hypermasculinity
in men--all acting as barriers in terms of stigma to disclosure
(Alaggia, 2005, 2010; Easton et al., 2014). Brazelton (2015)
similarly found that lack of discussions about sex, young age at
the onset of sexual abuse, therefore not having the language to
express what was happening to them, and preserving the family
good name by not talking about abuse in the family were also
barriers to disclosure.
Finally, it may be the case that more barriers continue to be
identified over facilitators of CSA disclosure perhaps because
of the methods employed in studies--particularly those draw-
ing on adult populations who delayed disclosure. These sam-
ples may not be representative of the overall population of CSA
victims, since they may have had more negative disclosure
Table 2. Factors Influencing Child Sexual Abuse Disclosures.
Barriers Facilitators
Age: The younger the child victim, the less likely they will purposefully
disclose.
Age: Disclosures increase with age, especially in adulthood.
Gender: Males may be less likely to disclose in childhood/adolescence,
fear of being seen as homosexual and as a victim, females experience
more self-blame and anticipation of being blamed and/or not
believed
Gender: Slight trend toward females who are older (adolescent) to
disclose before adulthood
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is a family member or in
a family-like role, disclosure is less likely to happen
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is not living with the
victim, disclosure rates increase
Internal: Shame, self-blame, and fear are psychological barriers. In
addition, fear of negative consequences on the family and for self-
safety inhibits disclosure
Dialogical context: Opportunities to disclose through discussion,
therapeutic relationship, information sessions on sexuality, and
sexual abuse prevention programs
Family relations: Families with a patriarchal structure, rigidly fixed
gender roles, dysfunctional communication, other forms of abuse
(i.e., domestic violence), and isolation inhibit disclosure
Family relations: Supportive parent­child relationship.
Involvement of others: Eyewitnesses coming forward and reporting;
detection through community members, professionals
Environmental and cultural context: Lack of discussion about sexuality;
passive acceptance that unwanted sexual experiences are inevitable;
not wanting to bring shame to the family by admitting sexual abuse;
lack of involvement from neighbors, school personnel; and stigma
perpetuated by societal perceptions
Environmental and cultural context: Promotion of open discussion of
sexuality; community member involvement

experiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers.
On the other hand, these findings may speak to the actual
imbalance between facilitating factors and barriers for disclo-
sure, the latter carrying more weight in the victims/survivors'
experiences, thus, explaining the high rates of disclosures
delayed until adulthood.
Facilitators. Although fewer disclosure facilitators are identi-
fied in this review, very important facilitators were nonetheless
uncovered--ones that should be noted for professionals in this
field of practice. Internal factors that facilitate disclosures
include symptoms that become unbearable, getting older with
increased developmental efficacy, and realizing that an offence
was committed (Collin-Ve
´zina et al., 2015; Crisma et al., 2004;
Easton, 2013; Hershkowitz et al. 2007; McElavaney, Greene,
& Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 2011). Circumstantial facil-
itators are those where the child discloses because there has
been evidence provided, eye-witnessing has occurred, and a
report has been made. Environmental factors include settings
that provide opportunities such as counseling, interviews,
information sessions and educational forums/workshops, and
prevention programs for children and youth to disclose.
To elaborate, dialogical contexts about CSA for children
and youth can provide opportunities for discussion that may
facilitate disclosures (Jensen et al., 2005). The research shows
creating open dialogue in relationship contexts, to offset the
power and influence of the perpetrator, can facilitate earlier
disclosure. Among disclosure facilitators is being asked about
abuse and given the opportunity to "tell" (McElavaney et al.,
2014); workshops on abuse and sexual abuse, in particular, can
facilitate disclosures (Ungar et al., 2009b); and using culturally
sensitive probes and questions (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In
Gagnier and Collin-Ve
´zina's (2016) study, positive disclosure
experiences were described by participants as those where they
felt that they had been listened to, were safe, were believed, and
were not judged by the person they disclosed to. Further, family
members and friends (peers) of the child victim can act as key
supports to creating an open relational context and fostering
positive responses (Jensen et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008;
Scho
¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009b). In particular, as
children grow older, they are more likely to disclose to a peer,
as shown in a number of studies, and this is an important reality
for counselors and educators to be aware of (Dumont et al.,
2014; Kogan, 2004; Scho
¨nbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al.,
2009b).
Discussion
Through examination of 33 studies published since the year
2000, this review identified five distinct themes regarding CSA
disclosure: (1) Disclosure is best viewed as an iterative,
interactive process rather than a discrete event done within
a relational context; (2) contemporary models reflect a
social­ecological, person-in-environment framework for
understanding the complex interplay of individual, familial,
contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure;
(3) age and gender are significant disclosure factors; (4) there
is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclo-
sure continue to outweigh facilitators. Based on these themes, a
number of conclusions are drawn from this review. First, dis-
closure as a process is emphasized throughout contemporary
research. Advances have been made in understanding these
complex processes. However, the disclosure process over
time--for example, how the first detection of CSA or attempts
to disclose in childhood impact later disclosures--are not well
understood. This is the result of the absence of a cohesive life-
course perspective in investigations, although age consistently
surfaces as significantly influencing CSA disclosure. Using a
life-course perspective through the use of longitudinal studies
is recommended.
The use of varied methodological designs, depending on the
developmental stage of the victims/survivors, influences the
data generated and subsequent findings. For example, most
studies on children and youth are based on file reviews of cases
that have been brought to the attention of authorities, or sur-
veys, with only a few studies using interviewing of younger
children. Therefore, there is less information available on pro-
cess issues with children and youth. In contrast, research on
adult populations largely favors the use of qualitative interview
methods for retrospective inquiry producing important process
findings. In addition, investigations have not yet captured the
disclosure experiences of adults in the "emerging adult" stage
given that adult studies have failed to recognized that the age
range of 18­24, which is now considered a developmental
phase defined by neurobiological developmental uniqueness.
As well, late adulthood has not been given attention as shown
by the absence of participants representing this age-group in
current research (70þ). With a swelling geriatric population in
North America, issues of historic CSA can be expected to
surface and, with that, new disclosures. This trend is also antici-
pated due to attitudinal shifts that have presumably occurred
over the last two generations about revealing such traumas and
changing views about discussing sexual victimization.
Interview guides used in a number of studies intentionally
probed for facilitators, producing notable findings. For exam-
ple, one such finding focuses on the importance of creating a
contextually supportive environment to promote disclosure
across the life course. These include developing therapeutic
relational contexts for disclosure by providing information
about sexuality, sexual abuse, prevention programming, and
by asking directly. Disclosures to professionals are positive
outcomes of how therapeutic contexts work; however, for for-
ensic purposes prompting such disclosures would be viewed as
problematic in legal settings, seriously compromising testimo-
nies for trial proceedings. This is one example that speaks to the
structural barriers victims and survivors run up against time and
time again. Facilitators that show evidence to promote disclo-
sure in one domain (therapeutic) are seen to work against CSA
survivors in another domain--such as legal settings when per-
petrators face prosecution. Defense attorneys will use this as
evidence that the disclosure was prompted, and therefore the
disclosure is potentially seen as not credible. Broadcasting of
Alaggia et al. 21
the frequency of acquitted cases or rulings in favor of the
perpetrator through media outlets, often sensationalized,
become a further compounding barrier. Given the review find-
ings, we conclude that barriers and facilitators to CSA disclo-
sures are nuanced and clearly embedded within intrapersonal,
interpersonal, environmental, contextual, and cultural
domains--often interlocked in complex ways.
Limitations
Although comprehensive in nature with its life-course cover-
age, this review may be limited by its qualitative, thematic
focus rather than providing an evaluative, quantitative account-
ing of CSA disclosures. However, because of the recent focus
on disclosure processes, the authors chose a suitably compati-
ble approach--qualitative in nature. As well, a traditional
checklist approach in rating the studies was not employed for
interrater reliability, since two of the authors hold expertise in
CSA disclosure research and are well versed with the literature.
This expertise, and through closely following a systematic
review framework (Kiteley & Stogdon, 2014), assures that a
thorough adjudication of the research literature was completed.
Implications for Research and Practice
These review findings have implications that can be useful in
guiding future research and practice:
 Solid strides are being made in the use of a social­eco-
logical framework to underpin investigations in the CSA
disclosure investigations. Research efforts and practice
considerations should continue in this vein. Investigat-
ing environmental factors and contextual and cultural
forces is understudied, necessitating more research in
these areas to more fully fill out understanding of CSA
disclosure from a social­ecological perspective.
 There is good evidence that CSA disclosures are more
likely to occur in a dialogical context--formal helping
relationships but as well as other relationships such as
peers and trusted adults. Providing information and edu-
cation on topics of sexuality in general, and sexual abuse
specifically, can help children and youth to disclose.
Raising awareness and prevention programs can pro-
mote disclosures of sexual violence committed against
children and youth.
 Goals of therapeutically supported disclosures (i.e.,
through therapy) may need to take precedence over for-
ensic approaches, if well-being of child victims and
adult survivors is to be made paramount. Legal pro-
cesses may act to facilitate disclosures but can also act
as barriers because of the negative outcomes experi-
enced in the court process.
 Practitioners need to keep in mind that the legal system
is lagging far behind in knowledge uptake of recent
evidence on CSA disclosures so that victims and
survivors continue to be systemically and structurally
disadvantaged in legal proceedings.
 Health-care practitioners (i.e., child abuse pediatricians,
family practice doctors, clinical nurse specialists, and
public health nurses) should be made aware of the evi-
dence in the CSA disclosure literature to create environ-
ments for facilitating therapeutic disclosures.
 Given that age is a stable predictor of disclosure of CSA,
more studies are needed that make use of a life-course
perspective. More longitudinal studies are needed to
better identify trends over different life stages.
 The emerging young adult as a developmental age group
needs specific investigation. Neuroscience research has
established that ages 18­24 is a distinct developmental
phase. Late adulthood is another life stage that deserves
to be researched.
 Gender needs to be more fully investigated in relation to
impact on disclosure. Awareness that boys and girls
have unique challenges and barriers in disclosing CSA
should be paramount for practitioners.
 Intervention planning should take note that disclosures
increase when perpetrators no longer reside with vic-
tims, and this finding should be heeded by policy and
law makers.
 Shame, self-blame, and fear are intrapersonal factors
that persistently emerge as barriers to CSA disclosures
and warrant more research to understand how to redress
these barriers for earlier disclosures.
Conclusion
There are still a substantial number of children and youth
who are subjected to sexual abuse, despite preventative
efforts. Just as concerning is the fact that many victims
continue to suffer in silence as evidenced by the high num-
bers of delayed disclosure. These hidden cases should not be
overlooked, and these victims should not be forgotten.
Despite significant progress in bringing the issue of CSA
to the forefront, improving facilitation of disclosure and
increasing positive influences on disclosure processes are
still critical in order to protect current and future genera-
tions of children and youth from the grave effects of sexual
violence. Further, the focus should not be simply on
strengthening and shoring up intrapersonal resources of vic-
tims to disclose but rather to change environmental condi-
tions to create a more supportive and safer context for CSA
victims and survivors to disclose.
