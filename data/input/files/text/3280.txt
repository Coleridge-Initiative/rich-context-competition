An Evolutionary Perspective on Mate
Rejection
Ashleigh J. Kelly1, Shelli L. Dubbs1, and Fiona Kate Barlow1
Abstract
We argue that mate rejection and ex-partner relationships are important, multifaceted topics that have been underresearched in
social and evolutionary psychology. Mate rejection and relationship dissolution are ubiquitous and form integral parts of the
human experience. Both also carry with them potential risks and benefits to our fitness and survival. Hence, we expect that mate
rejection would have given rise to evolved behavioral and psychological adaptations. Herein, we outline some of the many
unanswered questions in evolutionary psychology on these topics, at each step presenting novel hypotheses about how men and
women should behave when rejecting a mate or potential mate or in response to rejection. We intend these hypotheses and
suggestions for future research to be used as a basis for enriching our understanding of human mating from an evolutionary
perspective.

Rejection is a ubiquitous, necessary component of sexual selec-
tion, and the study of human behavior is incomplete without
considering it. Even though a fair portion of our potential
reproductive success (i.e., number of offspring) is likely to be
contingent on selecting the most evolutionarily advantageous
partner (Symons, 1980), rejecting an unsuitable mate is also
vital in determining whether and/or how our genes are passed
on (Darwin, 1872; see also Darwin & Wallace, 1858). Rejec-
tion, however, is not just the inverse of selection. Just as a
negative emotion isn't merely the absence of a positive one
(for discussion, see Pawelski, 2013), rejection is not a passive
process that occurs only in the context of selecting the best
partner while leaving behind less attractive suitors. People are
rejected even in the absence of a more viable option, and part-
ners who were previously selected are discarded. Human mat-
ing may even be considered along a continuum beginning at
active rejection (blocking mating attempts), progressing into
indifferent rejection (e.g., failing to select a mate), then mate
selection (choosing and gaining a viable partner), and finally
mate retention (keeping that partner).
The Pain and Ubiquity of Rejection and Ex-Partners
It's easy to cry when you realize that everyone you love will
reject you or die. (Palahniuk, 1996, p. 17)
In general, rejection hurts. While questioning those who had
been romantic rejecters and romantically rejected, Perilloux
and Buss (2008) reported that mate rejection could result in
depression, fear, reputational damage, and loss of self-esteem
(among other negative consequences). In line with other scho-
lars, we assert that negative affect in response to rejection is
adaptive (e.g., Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Perilloux & Buss,
2008). Both social and romantic rejection are potentially costly
and dangerous and may manifest painfully to discourage beha-
viors that lead to rejection, prompt conciliatory behaviors, and
minimize the chance of rejection recurring (as argued by Eisen-
berger & Lieberman, 2004). In the context of heterosexual
romantic rejection, people who (a) reject others appropriately
without provoking dangerous responses, (b) avoid rejection
themselves, and (c) respond positively to rejection, are likely
to be the ones who survived and passed on their genes. Those
who failed in any of these three areas risked social isolation
and/or missing out on reproduction entirely (Penke, Todd,

Lenton, & Fasolo, 2008), the splitting of resources and the
dissolution of other social relationships, and even physical
harm or death. Consequently, we argue that whom you reject
is just as important as whom you select in terms of how (and
whether) your genes are passed on to future generations.
Accordingly, if heterosexual mate rejection has had a large
impact on individuals' fitness over our evolutionary history,
then rejection itself should be a pervasive occurrence both
within and across cultures (as discussed by Perilloux & Buss,
2008).
The literature supports this. Rhoades, Kamp Dush,
Atkins, Stanley, and Markman (2011) revealed that among
unmarried 18- to 35-year-old Americans, approximately
36% had at least one breakup with a romantic partner over
a 20-month period. In addition, once a relationship is estab-
lished, there is no guarantee that it will last. Even marriage,
which is idealized to be a lifelong commitment, is not par-
ticularly binding, and many people experience multiple
divorces over their lifetime (Australian Bureau of Statistics,
2014). The United Kingdom Office for National Statistics
(2013) asserts that 34% of marriages in England and Wales
will end in divorce by their 20th wedding anniversary. For
marriages that occurred in the United States in the 1970s,
``48 percent had dissolved within 25 years'' (Stevenson &
Wolfers, 2007, p. 4). Although each cohort is different, and
rates were lower for those who entered their first marriages
in the 1980s (approximately 40% relationship dissolution by
around 20 years of marriage) and 1990s (approximately 23­
24% dissolution by around 10 years of marriage; Stevenson
& Wolfers, 2007), relationship dissolution is still a regular
occurrence for those who vowed to spend their lives
together. Note that in many cases, these relationship disso-
lutions were probably the result of one mate rejecting the
other as opposed to a mutual arrangement (for support, see
the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1973).
When examining rejection cross-culturally, it is clear that it
is not just a recent, Western, or geographically specific phe-
nomenon. Even in arranged marriages (both current and histor-
ical), parents have the ability to accept or reject mates on behalf
of their children (Apostolou, 2007, 2010). In many traditional
societies, those entering arranged marriages often have some
say in the choice of partner (with varying weight given to their
consent of the marriage; Apostolou, 2010). They may also have
an opportunity to meet and talk in a chaperoned manner and
either reject or accept one another. For most of our history as a
species, humans would have lived as hunter-gatherers in small
community groups (Hill et al., 2011; Dyble et al., 2015).
Within these groups, mate rejection is likely to have been
commonplace based on data from modern nonindustrialized
analogies. As noted by Pearsall (1947), women living in East
African tribes (e.g., Akikuyu, Akamba, and Wagiriama) have
the right to accept or reject potential suitors. According to
Marlowe (2004), among the Hadza of Tanzania, both sexes
are free to choose their own spouses, and before a woman's
first marriage, it is not unusual for her to be courted by
more than one man. In addition, for the Hazda, only about
20% of people remaining married to their first spouse their
whole life, making divorce the norm rather than the exception
(Marlowe, 2004).
Consistent with the argument that rejection is an evolution-
ary influenced and influencing factor, historically and cross-
culturally, common causes of divorce seem to be related to
reproductive concerns (i.e., infidelity and sterility; Betzig,
1989). To add to this, South and Lloyd (1995) found that
divorce in the United States was most likely when partners
perceived an abundance of mating opportunities. However,
despite the clear ubiquity of romantic rejection (both immedi-
ate rejection and after long-term couplings, i.e., relationship
dissolution), it has been underresearched in the field of evolu-
tionary psychology at least in comparison to mate selection.
Below and throughout, we review some of the existing
research.
In a pivotal study, Perilloux and Buss (2008) tested a series
of evolutionary hypotheses relating to mate rejection and
investigated breakup coping strategies. They found, for exam-
ple, that being the rejected party is more functionally costly
than being the rejecter, that women are more likely than men
to report experiencing ``costly'' stalking by their ex-partners,
and that rejecters experienced social costs such as being per-
ceived as mean. In addition to this research, several groups
have focused on the predictors of friendship after relationship
dissolution (e.g., Bullock, Hackathorn, Clark, & Mattingly,
2011; Metts, Cupach, & Bejlovec, 1989; Tan, Agnew, Van-
derdrift, & Harvey, 2014). Most recently, Mogilski and Well-
ing (in press) examined the reasons people provided for
retaining friendships with ex-partners. In doing so, these
researchers provide a detailed summary of the existing
research on postrelationship friendship, and we discuss some
of their empirical findings below. Several research groups
also briefly discuss the existing mate rejection literature
(e.g., Miner & Shackelford, 2010; Olderbak & Figueredo,
2010). These discussions and empirical findings complement
and inform our current theoretical proposals, yet to date, there
has been no synthesized theoretical review from an evolution-
ary perspective that discusses the precursors of mate rejection,
the ways by which we go about it and how the rejection is
received by both parties.
We argue that evolutionary psychology should turn more
attention to mate rejection, approaching it from many dif-
ferent angles. Although limited by the desire for brevity,
we first suggest approaches to examine the survival threats
one is exposed to during heterosexual romantic rejection
and how we might adaptively mitigate these risks. We
also discuss rejection in terms of mate value factors
(including physical attractiveness, fertility, age, resources,
dominance, and infidelity), as well as contextual factors
(mate poaching, operational sex ratio and availability of
alternatives, and social influence). We suggest that these
factors all play a part in shaping human methods for mate
rejection and reactions to it, and throughout, we provide
hypotheses and suggestions intended to further the research
in these areas.
2 Evolutionary Psychology
How Do We Best Reject People?
Above, we highlighted that rejection can be followed by social
ostracism, stalking, and other negative outcomes. We sug-
gested that those who have rejected mates, and survived to pass
on their genes, might be those who are particularly effective at
rejecting people while avoiding or reducing associated costs.
This begs the question: What rejection strategies work ``best''?
The strategies people use to reject each other are rich grounds
for potential research, however, like rejection itself, are under-
researched within the human mating literature. In fact, we have
not found a great deal of empirical work explicitly looking at
what rejection strategies are most successful within the mating
domain (see Duntley & Shackelford, 2012, for some related
theoretical proposals). However, several strategies have previ-
ously been identified and associated with better outcomes when
compared with other rejection methods. The work of Banks,
Altendorf, Greene, and Cody (1987), as well as Baxter (1979,
1982; see also Cody, 1982), suggests that using direct (sincere
justifications) or honest strategies (including expressing the
desire to de-escalate the relationship) may be more effective
(in terms of adjustment, social consequences, aggression, and
retaining closeness) than strategies such as positive tone,
avoidance, or manipulation. A direct rejection strategy might
involve telling a partner the real reasons relationship termina-
tion is desired, rather than pretending to be too busy to see
them (an avoidant strategy), or trying to make them feel better
without honestly stating the true reasons for the rejection (a
positive strategy).
However, this literature is sparse, unclear, and dated, so
although throughout we suggest that using direct or honest
strategies may be the most successful for self-protection, we
acknowledge that this may not be the case. In fact, this area
represents our first specific call for new research on how best to
reject potential or established partners. For future researchers,
we propose that simple reflective interview studies may be
useful here. In addition, a straightforward vignette study where
people respond to different rejection strategies may be of use.
In order to provide testable hypotheses in the present article,
however, we assume herein that direct and honest strategies are
adaptive (in line with Banks, Altendorf, Greene, & Cody, 1987;
Baxter, 1979, 1982; Cody, 1982). If adaptive, these strategies
might have evolved because on average, those people who
were honest and straightforward with their partners might have
elicited less violence and aggression during rejection than those
who used other strategies. By avoiding violence at this volatile
time, successful strategy choosers are more likely to have lived
and passed on this behavioral tendency.
Evolutionary Hypotheses Concerning Mate
Rejection
In the following sections, we draw on the basic tenets of evolu-
tionary theory to present predictions about mate rejection. We
discuss these in terms of (a) survival factors, (b) mate value
factors, and (c) contextual factors.
Survival Factors
Romantically rejecting someone, or being rejected, can be a
hazardous experience. For both men and women, the pro-
cess of romantic rejection is linked to verbal abuse (Kelly,
Dubbs, & Barlow, 2015), financial abuse (Romans, Forte,
Cohen, Du Mont, & Hyman, 2007), sexual abuse (Black
et al., 2011), physical abuse (Rennison & Welchans,
2002), and homicide (Glass, Laughon, Rutto, Bevacqua, &
Campbell, 2008; Hagelstam & Ha
¨kka
¨nen, 2006). These
threats clearly pose a risk to one's survival and ability to
produce or rear successful offspring, and are crucially
important to avoid and mitigate. As such, humans have
likely evolved methods to reduce the survival threats asso-
ciated with mate rejection (Perilloux & Buss, 2008).
It seems likely that signs of aggression, jealousy, or posses-
siveness in the initial or prestages of a relationship may lead to
an increased likelihood of rejection, as these acts may indicate
an elevated risk of abusive behavior later. However, we also
suggest a caveat. It is clear from violence and stalking research
that men present a greater danger to women than women do to
men. Statistically, women are more likely than men to be the
targets of sexual, physical, and financial abuse, as well as homi-
cide in heterosexual relationships (Black et al., 2011; Glass
et al., 2008; Hagelstam & Ha
¨kka
¨nen, 2006; Naved, 2013;
Rennison & Welchans, 2002; Romans et al., 2007; relatedly,
see Wilson & Daly, 1993). Therefore, women (in comparison to
men) should be more adaptively attuned to aggression and jea-
lousy in the initial stages of dating (e.g., noticing possessive-
ness and anger, vengeful tendencies, and bitterness toward ex-
partners). This should mean that women will be more likely
than men to reject suitors who display these traits in the early
stages of dating (a protective evolutionary response, similar to
those suggested by Duntley & Buss, 2012; Smuts, 1992).
The hypotheses presented above are simple; however, evo-
lution--and humans--are not. As will be seen throughout, and
specifically when it comes to aggression, simple hypotheses
have to be tempered. Here, we encounter competing concerns.
As we discuss within ``mate value factors'' (below), the trait of
dominance appears to be valued in men (Sadalla, Kenrick, &
Vershure, 1987; perhaps bestowing advantages such as greater
resource acquisition potential or physical protection, see Buss
& Schmitt, 1993). Aggression, of course, is closely tied to
dominance (and indeed dominance and status seeking may be
precursors to aggression; Bernhardt, 1997). To a certain extent,
then, dominance and possessiveness may increase the likeli-
hood of rejection in some circumstances (as detailed above)
and decrease the likelihood of rejection in others. We speculate
that minor indicators of dominance and aggression may reduce
rejection initially, but a tipping point may be reached where
displays of these traits become frightening. The same applies
for pursuit and stalking. Where these tipping points lie should
be empirically determined through research. As a brief research
example, one might manipulate the levels of aggression (and
dominance) displayed by confederate males within video inter-
views and have women opt to either ``meet'' or ``reject'' these
Kelly et al. 3
men. The reverse could also be performed to see where the
tipping points lie in men.
Pursuit and stalking after the termination of a relationship
are common occurrences (Bjorklund, Hakkanen-Nyholm,
Sheridan, & Roberts, 2010; Cupach & Spitzberg, 1998; Dutton
& Winstead, 2010). As an example, 48.5% of Finnish Univer-
sity students in a 2010 study reported having been stalked, and
25% of those stalkers were reportedly ex-partners (Bjorklund
et al., 2010). As detailed earlier, women are significantly more
likely to be the targets of stalking than men (Purcell, Path´
e, &
Mullen, 2002; Sheridan, Davies, & Boon, 2001; Tjaden &
Thoennes, 2000). Stalking can pose particular risks to fitness,
including reducing the victim's chances of establishing new
relationships (Buss & Duntley, 2011). It can also indirectly
affect fitness through the stalker's deliberate exposures of the
stalked party's personal information, or by causing reputational
damage within social circles (as discussed in Kelly et al., 2015;
Perilloux & Buss, 2008).
Hence, beyond displaying interest for a prospective partner
or providing reasonable attention to progress a relationship, we
expect that excessive pursuit or romantic interest displayed
during the formation stages of a relationship will increase the
likelihood of rejection. Here, excessive pursuit may entail lev-
els of contact beyond what is reasonably culturally expected
(relating to the frequency or type of contact), or violation of the
established dating norms (such as attempting to progress the
relationship too quickly or beyond its expected boundaries,
with acts of overfamiliarity or overcommitment). Again,
women should engage in rejection for these reasons (i.e., aty-
pical, forceful, persistent, or frequent romantic pursuit) more
frequently than men.
Persistence and stalking behaviors displayed after a rejec-
tion may affect behavior differently. As suggested by Duntley
and Buss (2012), stalking or unwanted pursuit behaviors may
be in part, or on balance, adaptive strategies, present within the
current population because on average they were successful
ways of gaining, retaining, or regaining partners over our evo-
lutionary history. Indeed, Mogilski & Welling (in press) found
that people frequently reported they had pursued friendship
with ex-partners because of ``continued romantic attraction,''
a construct which included notions such as ``I wanted to pre-
vent them from getting together with a new romantic interest''
(p. 3). Extending these points to the current discussion, post-
breakup relationships should be more likely if one ex-partner
persistently pursues the other (compared with couples who
make a clean break or engage in mild pursuit). We expect the
same if one ex-partner makes it difficult for the other to find an
alternate mate (e.g., due to reputational damage, stalking,
threats of harm or self-harm, or sabotaging their other dates).
This is not to be confused with the rejection-increasing
effects of pursuit behaviors we predicted above when relation-
ships are just being formed (where women are expected to be
repelled in order to avoid commencing a relationship with a
potentially dangerous man, a hypothesis that may extend to
some men too). We suggest that the history and previous inti-
macy make stalking strategies postrelationship more likely to
be successful than stalking strategies or persistence strategies
before any relationship is formed.
In addition to affecting people's reasons and propensity for
mate rejection, we similarly expect survival threats to affect
people's methods of undertaking mate rejection. Given safety
concerns, we expect women to use strategies aimed at positive
postrejection reactions from their partner, more so than men. In
line with the existing literature on intimate rejection, one might
then expect women to use more direct, honest strategies when
rejecting someone than men do, openly expressing the desire to
breakup. However, it is possible that to enhance self-protection
and minimize violence, women might use more offers of
friendship and comfort than men as well as placating and de-
escalation strategies. Indeed, when discussing potential adapta-
tions to avoid victimization, Duntley and Shackelford (2012, p.
63) stated, ``Humans . . . may possess adaptations designed to
attempt to reason with an attacker, describing the possible costs
of the person's violent behavior or suggesting other resolutions
to the conflict.'' In the case of severe physical risk, it is also
possible that avoidant-withdrawal strategies will be most effec-
tive, where women abandon the relationship without directly
telling their partner, thereby avoiding the risk of violence alto-
gether (as discussed by Duntley & Shackelford, 2012). Of
course, similar hypotheses can be put forward for men rejecting
women; however, at a mean level, safety concerns might be
less salient than reputational concerns.
Understanding which strategies reduce rejection fall out best
could be fruitful not only for evolutionary psychology but also
intimate partner violence research. Supporting the idea that
women might use avoidant-withdrawal strategies to avoid
harm, abused women have reported using this strategy, likely
out of fear that their partners might hurt or kill them, their
children, or pets if they knew that they were leaving (Hamby
& Bible, 2009; Jacobson & Gottman, 1998). However, in the
small-scale societies of our ancestral past, complete avoidance
may not have been possible. That is, individuals may have been
forced to live around ex-partners who had threatened or abused
them. Hence, we may see that women using avoidant-
withdrawal rejection strategies are quicker to secure new part-
ners than women who do not use these strategies, as gaining a
new partner is likely to provide some protection from ex-
partners (for discussion of the benefits of male partners, see
Buss & Duntley, 2011).
Women should also be more likely than men to seek other
forms of social support to reduce the risks of ending relation-
ships (typically with family, but also with friends). By sur-
rounding herself with kin or friends, a woman may receive
physical protection (discussed in Smuts, 1992) and possibly
reputational protection. In support of this notion, a review by
Hamby and Bible (2009) concluded that seeking social support
was the most common self-protection strategy reported by bat-
tered women across a variety of self-report studies. Further-
more, women who do not live near close kin, such as those in
patrilocal societies (where women leave their home or town to
live with their husband's family), are at greater risk of abuse
than women who stay near their kin (Warner, Lee, & Lee,
4 Evolutionary Psychology
1986; discussed in Smuts, 1992). We expect this social support
to be critical if the man being rejected is physically threatening
(e.g., dominant, masculine, aggressive, easily angered, posses-
sive, or jealous). We do not expect the same to be true for men
with female ex-partners who are jealous, possessive, or aggres-
sive, or at least this pattern should be seen to a lesser degree
than in women.
Dependency represents a further legitimate threat to sur-
vival. The extent to which an individual is dependent on their
romantic partner to meet their physical needs (e.g., shelter,
resources, and sexual intimacy) is expected to significantly
affect rejection. For example, it appears obvious that rejection
by an actual mate is typically more costly than rejection by a
potential mate. Relationships often entail high levels of invest-
ment, and the lives of the individuals often become intertwined
(e.g., sharing social circles, resources, and intimate informa-
tion). We predict that individuals rejected by potential mates
will cope better mentally than those rejected by actual mates.
Presuming that the pain of rejection exists to prompt efforts at
repair, or reconciliation (e.g., Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Peri-
lloux & Buss, 2008), the increased pain in response to the
termination of an established relationship itself should be adap-
tive (if unpleasant).
Continuing to examine coping, repeated rejections should
negatively impact coping more than one-off rejections. Being
frequently rejected by mates puts one at risk of being excluded
from mating altogether (Penke et al., 2008), which is clearly
costly. This, however, raises an interesting question: Is it ``bet-
ter to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all''?
(Tennyson, 1850, p. 44). We expect that repeated rejection by
potential mates would be the most costly from an evolutionary
perspective (never having the ability to reproduce or ``love'' at
all). Being subject to repeated rejection by actual partners (or
one specific partner) may be costly in terms of health and
psychology, but we expect it to be less threatening to reproduc-
tion and offspring survival than repeated rejection by potential
mates. Further, those who had the capacity to be rejected mul-
tiple times, and persist, might have been more likely to survive
and pass on their genes (compared with those who let rejection
defeat them and avoided future mating attempts). This may be
particularly the case for men, as women are typically the choo-
sier gender (Trivers, 1972).
Dependency on one's partner for resources should also
influence the extent to which people reject and how they react
to rejection. Increased dependency should make a person less
likely to reject a partner, and if they do, more likely to attempt
to maintain a relationship or friendship postrejection to protect
or retain access to resources. In the same manner, attachment,
previous investment in the relationship, and the presence of
children are all clearly variables worthy of further exploration
(see Betzig, 1989). For example, ex-partners may attempt to
reignite their relationship if the fitness costs of ending it were
too high (e.g., parents with children might get back together
due to the benefits it could bestow upon the children's sur-
vival). In support of this possibility, Mogilski and Welling
(in press) reported that people listed children or pregnancies
as reasons to remain friends postdissolution, which in some
cases is perhaps an intermediary step to reconciliation and
reigniting the relationship.
Discussing survival factors has allowed us to propose some
key theories. We have reasoned that physical threats may be
more important considerations for women as opposed to men in
mate rejection contexts. For men, the desire to obtain access to
multiple mates may make them more resilient to repeated mate
rejection than women. We also noted that stalking strategies
may have differing costs and benefits based on their timing
(whether before or after a romantic relationship) and that mate
rejection can legitimately threaten survival if high levels of
dependency are present. We now move on to considering mate
rejection through the lens of mate value factors and how these
may influence fitness.
Mate Value Factors
As Symons (1980) put it, ``Nowhere are people equally sexu-
ally attracted to all members of the other sex . . . .'' (pp. 177­
178). Individuals vary in the degree to which they possess traits
that are desirable to members of the other sex as well as the
number of desirable traits they possess. An individual who is
intelligent, kind, physically attractive, and of high social status
will be desired by many, and someone who does not possess
these traits will appeal to relatively fewer potential mates (e.g.,
Buss & Barnes, 1986; Buss et al., 1990; Buunk, Dijkstra, Fetch-
enhauer, & Kenrick, 2002). Individuals in the first instance are
said to be high in mate value, while those in the second are
lower in mate value.
Physical attractiveness plays a particularly strong role in
determining one's mate value (Buss, 2007; Gangestad,
Garver-Apgar, Simpson, & Cousins, 2007; Gangestad & Simp-
son, 2000; Thornhill & Gangestad, 1994; Walster, Aronson, &
Abrahams, 1966). As such, physical attractiveness can deter-
mine one's reproductive success, in part through increased
marriage probability (Jokela, 2009). In terms of nonphysical
traits, intelligence and kindness are consistently rated as impor-
tant by both sexes and often ranked as the most important traits
in a mate overall (Buss, 2007). Similarly, both sexes consider a
sense of humor (Bressler, Martin, & Balshine, 2006) and crea-
tive ability to be desirable (for discussion, see Miller, 2000).
The current literature on the topic would suggest that, in
general, both men and women who are high in mate value are
likely to be frequently approached by potential mates and
therefore less likely to be rejected and more likely to reject
potential and actual mates themselves (due to an abundance
of mating options). Although many predictions can be made
on these topics, we will focus only on those that can provide
novel insights, rather than those that provide simple and direct
extensions (or corollaries) of the mate selection literature.
For example, it has been suggested that individuals form
perceptions of their own mate value based on feedback from
others (Buss, 2000). Accordingly, if someone has been fre-
quently rejected (as either a potential or an actual mate), they
will recalibrate their perception of their mate value (downward,
Kelly et al. 5
in this instance; Perilloux & Buss, 2008). Hence, we predict
that they will become less likely to reject potential and actual
partners in a bid to find someone willing to partner or copulate
with them. Additionally, the larger the discrepancy in mate
value between partners, the more unstable the relationship
ought to be (compared to relationships of more equal mate
value; McNulty, Neff, & Karney, 2008). The person of higher
mate value should be more likely to end the relationship than
the person of lower mate value, and this should be exacerbated
if there are several alternative or higher quality mates available.
When dealing with long-term relationships, mate rejection
should also become much more likely when one partner's mate
value either increases (e.g., through wealth acquisition,
improving their appearance) or decreases (e.g., through
resource loss in men or aging in women; Buss, 1994).
Female determinants of mate value. It is also important to con-
sider that there are gender differences in the determinants of
mate value. Physical attractiveness is an important indicator of
women's mate value (Buss, 1989; Sprecher, Sullivan, & Hat-
field, 1994; Townsend & Levy, 1990) and is based on external
markers of youthfulness and fertility (high estrogen; e.g.,
Symons, 1979). As a woman gets older, her physical ability
to reproduce declines with a sharp drop-off in the late 30s until
ovulation ceases at around age 50 (Dunson, Colombo, & Baird,
2002). Predictably then, female age is negatively related to
perceptions of physical attractiveness and desirability, with
men more likely to prefer, and to marry, mates who are younger
than themselves (Baize & Schroeder, 1995; Buss, 1989; Ken-
rick & Keefe, 1992).
Indicators of high mate value for women often include
wrinkle-free even-toned skin, full lips, large eyes, and a low
waist-to-hip ratio (Singh, 1993; Wheatley et al., 2014). Posses-
sing these traits should make women more likely to engage in
rejection and lacking them should make them reject less.
Furthermore, since youthful women are in high demand, we
predict that younger women should reject mates more fre-
quently than older women.
Indeed, women should be more likely to be rejected, as their
age increases. However, it is important to note that there is a
lot of variability in how aging will affect a woman's fertility and
appearance. That is, to an extent, some women may become
more physically attractive or fertile as they age (e.g., due to indi-
vidual differences in fertility, growing out of factors that detract
from appearance such as acne or eczema, etc.), while some may
experience a large decline in attractiveness or fertility. Factors
that affect ``apparent'' age and youthful looks are likely to affect
rejectionindirectly. However, itshould be noted thatthisfocus on
appearance is not limited to women. A recent meta-analysis of
speed-dating studies revealed that attractiveness and wealth pre-
dicted the romantic evaluations of both men and women
(although wealth to a lesser extent for both sexes; Eastwick,
Luchies, Finkel, & Hunt, 2014). These findings also suggest that
in addition to physical attractiveness, high levels of wealth may
positively affect mate value for women and by extension,
women's mate rejection, at least when selecting a mate.
Relatedly, women should be the most fearful of rejection
during pregnancy and when they have young children, when
losing a partner and the resources they provide would be the
most consequential. Furthermore, we expect pregnant women
and women with young children to be less likely to reject
established partners compared with nonpregnant women of
similar age, as well as childless women, and those with older
children. We can imagine these women falling at the far right
of the ``human mating continuum'' (proposed at the beginning
of this article, which ranges from active rejection to mate reten-
tion), doing their best to retain partners and avoid rejection. Of
course, this prediction suggests that pregnant women and
women with young children will engage in more mate retention
behaviors than younger or childless women, or women with
older children.
Male determinants of mate value. While attractiveness is also
important for men, traits such as dominance, ambition, high
status, wealth, and physical size--all either directly or indir-
ectly related to his ability to acquire resources--are also impor-
tant determinants of mate value (Buss, 1989, 2007; Feingold,
1992; Sadalla et al., 1987; Sprecher, Sullivan, & Hatfield,
1994). Exemplifying this, women across 37 cultures consis-
tently reported liking ambitious and industrious men as well
as those who had ``good financial prospects'' (Buss, 1989; Buss
et al., 1990). Possessing these traits should make men more
likely to engage in rejection and lacking them should make
them reject less (as they will have an abundance of options).
As mentioned, however, human mate rejection is fueled by a
complex, dynamic set of considerations. High levels of dom-
inance coupled with low levels of kindness in men are not
typically seen as attractive by women, yet the combination of
high dominance and high kindness might be (e.g., Miller &
Todd, 1998; or high dominance directed toward same-sex oth-
ers but not toward the romantic partner, see Lukaszewski &
Roney, 2010). However, in line with our point that rejection is
not just the inverse of mate selection, we expect that in estab-
lished relationships, a man's dominance will decrease his like-
lihood of rejection regardless of kindness (or where he directs
his dominance) due to his partner's potential concerns about
physical aggression in response to her choice to reject.
The relationship between age and rejection is less clear for
men than for women. Like women, men's externally rated
physical attractiveness declines with age, although not as stee-
ply as women's (Deutsch, Zalenski, & Clark, 1986). On the one
hand, since it often takes time for men to accumulate resources,
rise in social rank, or establish dominance, older men can
sometimes be of higher mate value than younger men (Baize
& Schroeder, 1995), whereas on the other hand, younger men
have a physical advantage (more youthful looks, higher muscle
mass, etc.). For some men then, age may be associated with the
increased rejection of women, negating the expected negative
association between age and propensity for rejection due to
their own declining physical appearance and abilities (e.g.,
sagging skin and decreased strength). That is, contrary to
expectations that older (presumably less physically attractive)
6 Evolutionary Psychology
men will reject less, a man may be more likely to reject both
current and potential partners as he increases in age compared
to when he was younger, if he possesses wealth or resources
(i.e., wealth moderates the relationship between age and rejec-
tion for men).
However, hypotheses relating to women's physical attrac-
tiveness should also somewhat extend to men, just to a lesser
degree than women (and involve male-relevant attractiveness
markers, including broad shoulders and muscularity). That is,
physically attractive men should be more likely to reject
women than unattractive men, but especially so when these
men have wealth and resources. Additionally, we expect a man
to be more likely to reject a woman as she increases in age (for
established relationships), if she is older than him (for potential
partners; Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Deutsch et al., 1986), or if she
cannot produce children. On the other hand, we expect a man to
be more likely to be rejected if his career or earning prospects
dwindle (e.g., his ability to obtain resources is compromised, if
he declines in status, or perhaps even if he has failed to increase
in status). Additionally, both women and men who lose signif-
icant resources upon relationship dissolution are also expected
to have worse outcomes than those who support themselves
independently, although this is expected to be less exaggerated
for men than for women.
Rejection strategies and postrejection relations. As mentioned,
rejection can be followed by anger and aggression, or attempts
to maintain a friendship. We argue that desiring the option to
reestablish the relationship will be more likely when rejecting
someone of high mate value, and therefore friendship should be
pursued in order to ``leave the door open'' to returning to the
relationship, to minimize pain, or avoid the chance of an irre-
parable relationship breakdown. This should be exaggerated if
the rejecter is of relatively lower mate value than the rejected,
or if the rejected has increased in mate value. Of course, this
specifies a rare case where someone rejects a high mate value
partner--by and large, high mate value partners are not likely
to face rejection. Specifically (based also on the ``halo'' effect
of physical attractiveness, e.g., Timmerman & Hewitt, 1980,
and the proposed moderating effect of honesty and directness,
see Banks et al., 1987; Baxter, 1982), if they are rejected, we
expect that people of high mate value will experience more
direct or honest rejection strategies as well as offers of friend-
ship and placating strategies (similar to Banks et al., 1987). As
these are proposed as less destructive breakup strategies than
other options, they may allow the rejecter to retain some of the
benefits of the relationship (e.g., friendship, social support,
access to resources, and physical protection).
If maintaining a friendship is not possible, then those of low
mate value who have been rejected may be more likely than
their high mate value counterparts to stalk their former partner.
Furthermore, when considering reentering the mating market
postrejection, individuals should be more likely to take action
to improve their chances of attracting a different, high-quality
mate--by increasing their respective mate values (Perilloux &
Buss, 2008).
Infidelity. When looking at people's reasons for undertaking
rejection, the concept of infidelity may be used to extend our
previous hypotheses regarding mate value. A primary reason
for rejection within a relationship is infidelity (Betzig, 1989),
yet we expect that several factors may qualify the extent to
which infidelity results in rejection. For example, although
mate rejection should be more likely to occur when infidelity
occurs compared to when it does not (Betzig, 1989), we predict
that this effect should be moderated by the cheater's mate
value, such that a high mate value cheater is less likely to be
rejected than a low mate value cheater.
In addition, some forms of infidelity pose a risk to one
gender more than the other (Shackelford, Buss, & Bennett,
2002). If a woman engages in sexual infidelity, men are at risk
of being cuckolded and investing in another man's offspring
(Buss, 1994; Trivers, 1972). If a man engages in emotional
infidelity, women are at risk of losing resources to another
woman. Here, both sexes are fearful of losing their partner's
resources to another (slightly differentiated by the attributes
each gender finds relatively attractive in the other), and this
should clearly affect their respective reasons for rejection (for
discussion, see Miner & Shackelford, 2010). Additionally, the
likelihood of rejection resulting from infidelity should be
reduced if the couple had offspring, if either party is highly
dependent on the other for survival, or if the options for alter-
native, high-quality mates are limited.
Contextual Factors
In the final section of this theoretical article, we discuss the
factors surrounding rejection that are likely to influence
whether it takes place, how it is done, and what it results in.
We first turn our attention to the case of rejection in the context
of mate poaching, before moving onto broader factors, such as
the operational sex ratio.
Mate poaching. Mate poaching refers to the act of pursuing a
person who is already involved with someone else (Schmitt &
Buss, 2001). It is worth noting that mate poaching is inherently
risky (e.g., mate poachers risk backlash from their target's
partner), time-consuming, and less likely to yield results than
pursuing an unattached person. We suggest that partners who
are successfully mate poached, or who have engaged in infide-
lity, may be fearful of physical, emotional, or social retaliation
directed at both themselves and their new partner. They may
therefore strive to placate their partner during the rejection, for
example, by using kindness and offers of friendship. This
should be exaggerated for women in comparison to men, given
the safety factors outlined earlier.
Finally, those who have been mate poached (regardless of
whether the new postpoaching relationship lasted long-term or
resulted in children) should be less likely to engage in stalking,
persistence, or pursuit behaviors postrelationship and more
likely to terminate contact with their ex-partner. We expect
this because they are likely to have recalibrated their mate
value upward, perceiving an abundance of mating options (as
Kelly et al. 7
during the poaching process, there was competition for them
between at least two parties).
Operational sex ratio and availability of alternatives. The opera-
tional sex ratio is defined as the ratio of reproductively viable
women to men (e.g., Clutton-Brock, 2007; Emlen, 1976; Emlen
& Oring, 1977; Kvarnemo & Ahnesjo, 1996). In countries
where the sex ratio is low (fewer men relative to women), there
are increased numbers of young women reproducing outside of
marriage (Barber, 2000) and women are more likely to pursue
short-term relationships and engage in casual sex (Schmitt,
2005). Conversely, where the sex ratio is high (more men rela-
tive to women), men are more likely to pursue long-term mat-
ing strategies. The hypotheses presented in this section apply
both across times when the sex ratio is skewed (historically and
into the future) and between areas where sex ratios differ.
In terms of general reasons for mate rejection, the availabil-
ity and quality of alternative mates should be highly predictive
of whether an individual will choose to break up an existing
relationship or reject a potential mate. Some past research sup-
ports this assertion. For example, White and Booth (1991) and
Udry (1981) report that people who believe they will be able to
find another spouse easily are more likely to terminate their
current marriage. In a study by South and Lloyd (1995), per-
ceived abundance of potential spousal alternatives posed a sig-
nificant risk for the dissolution of marriages among White
Americans. Similarly, in an experimental study, men who were
shown photos of physically attractive women (Playboy and
Penthouse centerfolds) were less satisfied with their current
relationship and reported that their partner was less sexually
attractive compared to men shown images of abstract art (Ken-
rick & Gutierres, 1989).
In conditions where the sex ratio is not in one's favor (i.e.,
low for women or high for men), competition among the over-
represented gender will intensify. This will increase the risk of
a person of that gender missing the opportunity to reproduce
(Kvarnemo & Ahnesjo, 1996). Those in this situation ought to
be more flexible about whom they accept as mates, that is, less
likely to reject potential mates and less likely to abandon exist-
ing partners or dates. Conversely, the underrepresented (and
thus sought after) gender's standards for an acceptable mate
should increase, resulting in a greater likelihood that they will
reject potential mates and existing mates that fall short of their
current wants or needs (Stockley & Campbell, 2013).
Where the sex ratio is favorable to one's gender, we predict
that ex-partners will be less likely to attempt to reignite rela-
tionships that have dissolved or pursue friendships with ex-
partners. People in these conditions should also be less likely
to report retaining their ex-partner as a ``backup'' partner, rela-
tive to those in unfavorable conditions. Where the sex ratio is
not favorable to one's gender, we expect those of that gender to
attempt to use accommodative rejection strategies in the rare
case that they do reject a partner or potential partner (e.g., use
more direct or honest rejection strategies and provide offers of
friendship during rejection; see Metts et al., 1989). This is
because their mating options are fewer, and completely losing
access to any one partner (whether desirable or not) could result
in reduced reproductive success. People should also be more
persistent and more likely to try to reestablish a relationship or
friendship with an ex-partner when they perceive fewer mating
alternatives. The operational sex ratio might also influence
people's reactions to being rejected. If friendship with an ex-
partner is not possible, the overrepresented gender should be
more likely to display jealousy and perpetrate stalking, aggres-
sion, and violence toward ex-partners.
The effect of the operational sex ratio on mating behavior
highlights that differences between populations of humans may
signify adaptations to the local environment, and that adaptive
behaviors need not be exhibited universally. As an example,
differences in pathogen prevalence may lead to differential
preferences for mates with sexually dimorphic facial features
between cultures (DeBruine, Jones, Crawford, Welling, & Lit-
tle, 2010). Evolutionary theory can also be applied to explain
differing behaviors in environments that are harsh versus stable
(Lee & Zietsch, 2011). Factors such as disease, pathogen pre-
valence, and environmental threat should be considered for
further extensions of mate rejection theory.
Pathogen load, noncommunicable diseases, or local mortal-
ity rates may influence mate rejection. We may see, for
instance, that a partner acquiring new pathogens leads to an
increased likelihood that they will be rejected (due to contagion
risk). In other circumstances, potential mates may be wary of
partnering with an ill person (whether contagious or not).
Furthermore, current mates may not want to remain partnered
to someone who has acquired a greater number of pathogens or
health issues, even if these don't affect their apparent mate
value (such as appearance, strength, or earnings).
We might also expect high mortality rates to increase the like-
lihood of rejection in the context of existing relationships (as seen
in Schmitt, 2005). High rates of mortality may cue organisms to
invest in current rather than future reproduction (e.g., Kaplan &
Gangestad, 2005). That is, they might choose to pursue multiple
mating partners as opposed to one stable, monogamous relation-
ship. For males, especially, this may lead to increased mate rejec-
tion, rejecting partners more frequently in order to quickly obtain
multiple reproductive opportunities. However, since the benefits
of mate rejection should depend on the operational sex ratio
(Kokko & Jennions, 2008), if disease, war, or environmental
factors are claiming more lives from one gender than the other,
wemightexpectrelationshipstobemorestableduetothescarcity
of other potential mating options (but within the bounds of our
predictions for operational sex ratios, see above).
Social influence and information. Culture undoubtedly shapes
human sexuality and will influence mate rejection. In Western
societies today, people generally begin and end romantic rela-
tionships autonomously. Westerners typically date several indi-
viduals before settling into marriage or an equally long-term
relationship. With reduced social stigma surrounding divorce
or serial monogamy compared with other cultures, mate rejec-
tion is common and may occur openly with relatively few
social repercussions. Conversely, in collectivistic or religious
8 Evolutionary Psychology
monogamous societies, mating decisions are not typically
made autonomously and divorce is likely to be shunned
(Buunk, Park, & Duncan, 2010). Therefore, an individual's
ability to reject a mate may be restricted. Specifically, culture
influences whether individuals can reject a mate (for discus-
sion, see Buss, 1994), and mate rejection may be easier in
Westernized societies and more difficult in more traditional
societies.
In terms of parents rejecting suitors on behalf of their off-
spring, many of the hypotheses discussed throughout this arti-
cle are still likely to apply. However, physical attractiveness
may be less important to parents than children (as seen in
Perilloux, Fleischman, & Buss, 2011), thus low physical attrac-
tiveness may be less likely to elicit rejection by parents than
their children. Peers and kin are likely to encourage rejection if
they see a relative or friend is not being choosy enough, or to
discourage rejection when they see the suitor as advantageous
or there are few alternatives. Both women and men are influ-
enced by social information, but this is likely to be in regard to
different traits, and this particular effect should be more pro-
nounced for women than men due to the different physical
costs of reproduction for each sex (Trivers, 1972). Considering
that mate choice is more consequential for women than men,
parents should have a disproportionate effect on their daugh-
ters' mate rejection as compared to their sons' mate rejection.
Supporting this, research does show that parents are more con-
trolling of--and emotionally invested in--daughters' mating
behavior than their sons' mating behavior (Perilloux, Fleisch-
man, & Buss, 2008; see also Perilloux et al., 2011). This should
also arise because men are not typically discouraged from
partnering with many different women (Buss, 1994). Adding
further support, women have been shown to be more sensitive
to their parents' opinions of their mate choices compared to
men. That is, women have reported that if their parents did not
like their romantic partner, they would consider ending the
relationship (Dubbs, Buunk, & Li, 2011).
In comparison to men, women also appear to be more likely
than men to seek their friends' opinions of a potential mate
(Morr Serewicz & Gale, 2008). They also seem to be more
sensitive to other social cues regarding mating and rejection
(see Feingold, 1992). For example, research has found that
women are more likely to judge a man to be a desirable mate,
and therefore be less likely to reject him, if other women are
with him, particularly if these women are physically attractive
(Uller & Johansson, 2003; Waynforth, 2007). This may be
because certain traits (including ambition, status, wealth, and
dominance) can be difficult to assess accurately using visual
cues. Similarly, men may attempt to fake or exaggerate these
traits. Because of this, we expect that negative information
about a potential mate from social sources should impact on
both sexes' rejection decisions, but impact on women's mate
rejection decisions more so than men's. For example, if a
woman's friends or family said a man was untrustworthy, a
womanizer, unkind, or stingy, she may be more likely to incor-
porate such social information into her mating decision. In turn,
this could make rejection more likely.
In contrast, although in general we expect women to be
more sensitive to social input than men, we expect men to be
more sensitive to information about a woman's sexual history
and fidelity. This is because women's concealed ovulation
means paternity is not ensured for men, and they are therefore
more concerned with controlling a partner's sexuality than
women (Buss, 1994; Trivers, 1972; see also Smuts, 1992).
Information about chastity and sexual loyalty, therefore, would
be of more interest to men than to women and serve to inform
their mating decisions more so than women's (Buss, 1994), and
hence should also inform their rejection decisions more so than
women's.
In terms of the methods people use to reject others in order
to avoid social sanction, as mentioned, we tentatively expect
people to report using honest or direct strategies, and offering
friendship during and after rejection in order to preserve their
reputations or ``save face.'' Attempts to reject appropriately
should be exaggerated if the ex-couple has overlapping social
networks (implied by the work of Perilloux & Buss, 2008). This
is because both partners are likely to be privy to a wide range of
intimate details about each other that are potentially embarras-
sing or damaging to their partner's reputation (Duntley & Buss,
2012). Ending a relationship badly (perhaps by terminating it in
a hurtful or demeaning way) may inspire the rejected partner to
seek revenge by leaking intimate details, which could have
fitness repercussions for the affected partner (in addition to any
potentially violent outcomes). For example, this may result in a
lack of interested mate alternatives or social rejection from a
group that provides resources or protection.
Additionally, perpetrators of violence, stalking, and aggres-
sion during and after relationships should have reduced mating
opportunities within a particular social group in contexts where
members of the group are aware of their propensity for these
behaviors or reactions. That is, they should be more likely to be
physically restricted from mating (e.g., imprisoned or threat-
ened) as a coevolved kin response to these behaviors (Duntley
& Buss, 2012; Smuts, 1992; see also Duntley & Shackelford,
2012).
Conclusions
Mate rejection is an important, multifaceted topic that has been
underresearched in the fields of evolutionary and social psy-
chology. It is a crucial part of sexual selection and examining it
through an evolutionary lens provides a myriad of novel
hypotheses yet to be explored. Throughout this article, we have
suggested that humans have developed particularly strong reac-
tions to mate rejection because it has serious evolutionary con-
sequences with the ability to substantially affect our fitness. We
examined how people may adaptively rely on evolutionarily
relevant factors to determine whether to reject someone. We
also proposed methods people might use to try and reject some-
one while mitigating the risks rejection poses, both during and
after it occurs. We discussed this topic in terms of survival
factors, mate value factors, and contextual factors (including
social constraints). It is our hope that the hypotheses developed
Kelly et al. 9
may be utilized and expanded upon to enrich our understanding
of human mating from an evolutionary perspective.
