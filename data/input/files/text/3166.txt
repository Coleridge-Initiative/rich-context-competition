Non-technical Summary
Research question
Against the backdrop of the financial crisis, central banks implemented quantita-
tive easing (QE) and forward guidance (FG) policies. Over the past few years, a
consensus has emerged that such measures lead to expansionary macroeconomic
effects. However, it is also well known that New Keynesian models can give rise
to puzzles if the nominal interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound or a
temporary peg (due to a FG policy). In this study, we focus on the reversal puzzle
(see Carlstrom et al., 2015): If the central bank implements QE in combination
with FG, the effects on output and inflation increase with the length of FG up
to some critical duration; if this critical duration is exceeded, the model predicts
recession and deflation.
Contribution
Our contribution is threefold. First, we illustrate the relevance of the reversal
puzzle in a plausible policy scenario by analyzing the macroeconomic effects of QE
in combination with FG of variable duration. Second, we derive the analytical
solution of the model and show that two ingredients are necessary, though not
sufficient, for the puzzle to occur: First, the solution of the model needs to feature
complex eigenvalues, and second, monetary policies' FG needs to be perfectly
anticipated by the agents. Third, we formulate two possibilities for overcoming
sign switches in the model's simulations.
Results
We find that the reversal puzzle is very tenacious and that it is intimately related
to agents' expectations in the economy. This is illustrated by two different modifi-
cations to our analysis, which both lead to the disappearance of the reversal puzzle.
First, we show that a deviation from the assumption of perfect foresight (i.e. if we,
instead, solve the model under certainty equivalence) eliminates the puzzle. Sec-
ond, if we retain the assumption of perfect foresight but manage agents' inflation
expectations with a price-level-targeting strategy, the reversal puzzle is also ab-
sent. Both modifications and its implications for the reversal puzzle are explained
using the solution of the model.

Abstract
We analyze the macroeconomic implications of a transient interest-rate
peg in combination with a QE program in a non-linear medium-scale DSGE
model. In this context, we re-examine what has become known as the rever-
sal puzzle (Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paustian, 2015) and provide an analytical
explanation for its appearance. We show that the puzzle is intimately re-
lated with agents' expectations. If, for instance, agents do not anticipate
the peg, the reversal does not appear. The same is true if agents' infla-
tion expectations are influenced by a monetary authority which follows a
price-level-targeting rule instead of a standard Taylor rule. In this case,
sign reversals do not occur even for very long durations of pegged nominal
interest rates.

BUNDESBANK DISCUSSION PAPER NO 1/2017
1 Introduction
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, major central banks adopted a series of
unconventional monetary policy measures both to restore the functioning of the
monetary transmission mechanism and to provide further accommodation in a
low-inflation environment. In particular, sovereign bond purchase programs, often
referred to as quantitative easing (QE), and forward guidance were implemented
by major central banks as policy responses to anemic growth and low inflation.
Such unconventional measures were adopted as alternative instruments when cen-
tral banks had reached the effective lower bound on nominal short-term interest
rates. While there is no consensus yet as to how far a given purchase program
can stimulate output and inflation, empirical models and (suitably modified) New
Keynesian models alike support the view that QE and forward guidance are expan-
sionary at the zero lower bound (see, for example, Carlstrom, Fuerst and Paus-
tian, 2017; Gertler and Karadi, 2013; Chen, C´
urdia and Ferrero, 2012, and the
references therein).
However, recently Cochrane (2015), Garc´
ia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015), and
Carlstrom et al. (2015) among others have illustrated that the standard New Key-
nesian model can give rise to puzzles if the policy rate is kept constant for some
time, typically at the zero lower bound.1 Prominent among these is the forward
guidance puzzle. In this phenomenon, forward guidance (i.e., an announced in-
tention of the central bank to keep the nominal interest rate constant for a given
period of time) implies huge expansionary and inflationary effects in the canonical
1Unlike the papers by Cochrane (2015) and Garc´
ia-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) our paper
is not about multiplicity and equilibrium selection. For a discussion of multiplicity in the context
of the zero lower bound, see also Holden (2017).

New Keynesian model (e.g., Del Negro, Giannoni and Patterson, 2015). A related
effect, the reversal puzzle, has been described recently by Carlstrom et al. (2015).
According to the nature of this puzzle, pegging the interest rate for a sufficiently
long period of time in the standard New Keynesian model can give rise to coun-
terintuitive sign reversals in the path of the endogenous variables. The effect of
the interest-rate peg can switch from highly expansionary to highly contractionary
even for small changes in the length of the interest-rate peg.
In this paper, we illustrate that the reversal puzzle can be a tenacious problem in
the context of analyzing the effects of a QE program2 and make two suggestions
about how to overcome it. For our analysis, we jointly analyze a temporary, fully
anticipated interest-rate peg in combination with a QE program in the model
of Carlstrom et al. (2017). In the absence of the peg, the model predicts the
orthodox view, that is, an increase in output and inflation in response to the
launch of a QE program. If, however, the central bank keeps the policy rate
constant for some time, the responses of the model's variables can switch their
sign: Output and inflation first increase with the duration of the peg and tend
to explode as the duration of the peg approaches some critical value (after four
quarters in our analysis). But if the duration of the peg exceeds this critical value,
the model predicts a counterintuitive sign reversal (i.e., the reversal puzzle) or, put
differently, a sizeable deflation instead of inflation. Furthermore, if we continue
to hold the interest rate fixed for an even longer period of time, the sign of the
model's predictions changes once again. Thus, the qualitative response of output
and inflation oscillates as the duration of the peg expands into the far future. We

a plausible policy scenario.

provide intuition for this puzzling result and show analytically that the reversal
critically hinges on two things: First, the model needs to feature endogenous state
variables, which imply complex eigenvalues in the solution of the system, and
second, the assumption that the interest-rate peg is perfectly anticipated. The
necessity of complex eigenvalues in the model's solution was already pointed out
by Carlstrom et al. (2015). In particular, they find, based on the canonical 3-
equation DNK model with inflation indexation, that a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of the reversal puzzle is that the explosive eigenvalues
become complex-valued. However, in contrast to Carlstrom et al. (2015), we show
that if we use a richer model to describe a plausible policy scenario the existence of
complex eigenvalues is merely a necessary but no longer a sufficient condition. We
further show that the presence of the reversal puzzle is very robust with respect
to the calibration of the model.
The analytical solution of the model suggests that the expectations of the agents
in the economy are key for the appearance of the reversal puzzle. We illustrate
this finding by discussing two different modifications to our analysis. First, if
agents take the nominal interest-rate peg into account only contemporaneously,
but expect the peg to be absent in the future (no anticipation), i.e., if they operate
as under certainty equivalence, sign reversals disappear irrespective of the duration
of the peg. Thus, if we deviate from the assumption of perfect anticipation of the
interest-rate peg and, instead, assume that agents' expectations do not incorporate
forward guidance into their decisions (i.e., the future development of the nominal
interest-rate peg), the reversal puzzle does not occur. Second, if we retain the
assumption that agents perfectly anticipate the future interest rate path but change
3
agents' expectations by assuming that monetary policy is going to follow a different
monetary policy rule, namely price-level targeting instead of a Taylor rule, the
reversal puzzle vanishes, too.
These two suggestions for overcoming the reversal puzzle therefore underscore the
fact that the appearance of the reversal puzzle is intimately related to agents' ex-
pectations. If people do not anticipate the interest-rate peg, it is merely a series of
unanticipated shocks and therefore the reversal does not appear. But why is price-
level targeting effective at overcoming the reversal? If monetary policy follows a
price-level-targeting rule, the central bank aims at stabilizing the aggregate price
level around a predetermined path. Thus, if there is a shock that pushes the price
level away from the target-price path, future inflation will be required to adjust in
a way to bring the price path back to target. Put differently, past deviations from
target are corrected under price-level targeting. If monetary policy is credible, the
forward-looking rational agent thus expects a complete correction of past devia-
tions. This mitigates the expansionary effect of the anticipated peg and QE from
the very beginning. A bit more technically, the response of inflation to a series of
forward guidance shocks will neither grow exponentially and reach an asymptote
nor will it reverse its sign. As a consequence, sign reversals do not occur even
for very long durations of pegged nominal interest rates (in our example for much
more than 15 years).
The importance of forward-lookingness and therefore inflation expectations for the
explanation of the reversal puzzle has already been emphasized by Carlstrom et al.
(2015), who analyzed the reversal puzzle in the context of a standard New Keyne-
4
sian model.3 They argue that, in particular, inflation indexation is an important
precondition for the sign switch to arise: If there is a backward-looking element
in the Phillips curve, which is due to indexation, there is "...nothing to anchor the
terminal level of inflation"4 at the end of the peg.5 By contrast, in their model
variant without indexation, the level of inflation after the peg does not depend on
the previous pegged period (the same is true for output) and therefore the Taylor
rule (that kicks in after the peg) imposes a terminal condition on the inflation
rate.6
To overcome the reversal puzzle Carlstrom et al. (2015) suggest assuming sticky
information instead of Calvo pricing (see also Kiley, 2016). The key difference
between the sticky-price and the sticky-information framework is that under sticky
prices (and assuming indexation) the Phillips curve states that current inflation
depends on both lagged inflation and expectations of tomorrow's inflation, whereas
under sticky information the Phillips curve states that only past expectations of
the current marginal costs and inflation matter for inflation today. In this sense
the firms are much less forward-looking in the sticky information framework. As
a consequence, there are no inflation reversals in their sticky-information model.7
3Las´
een and Svensson (2011) and Lind´
e, Smets and Wouters (2016) also mention the appear-
ance of sign switches when simulating their models in combination with a transient interest-rate
peg. However, both studies do not elaborate on the source of the puzzle.
4See Carlstrom et al. (2015), p. 234.
5If the Phillips curve entails lagged inflation (which adds an endogenous state variable to
the system), the terminal level of inflation is no longer exogenous. Put differently, there is
nothing to pin down the terminal level of inflation at the end of the peg. Consequently, if initial
inflation depends on terminal inflation, but terminal inflation depends on initial inflation, the
counterintuitive reversal may arise.
6Solving the model backward gives a monotonic (exponential) path for inflation (and output).
7Several other authors relate the existence of the forward guidance puzzle to the important
role of expectations and provide alternative approaches to deal with it. Notable examples in-
clude Farhi and Werning (2017) who depart from the assumption of rational expectations and
adopt some form of bounded rationality, and Angeletos and Lian (2016) who introduce an incom-

We organize our paper as follows. The next section presents the model we use for
the analysis and its main characteristics. Section 3 explains how we implement
the QE program and the transient interest-rate peg. Section 4 presents a short
description of the solution method. Section 5 provides our first set of simulation
results. In subsection 5.1, we analyze the effects of a QE program without an
interest-rate peg to illustrate the transmission of the QE program: The model is
consistent with the prevailing view that QE generates a positive response of infla-
tion and output. Subsection 5.2 then illustrates the effects of QE in combination
with an interest-rate peg of variable duration and shows that the model produces
a reversal puzzle if the policy rate is kept constant for a sufficiently long period of
time. We then derive the solution of the model and show why reversals appear.
Subsection 5.3 documents that the reversal puzzle is hard to get rid off since it
remains for a very wide range of calibrations of the model. In section 6 we present
the aforementioned two modifications to our analysis, which ­ independently of
each other ­ help to overcome the reversal puzzle. In subsection 6.1 we deviate
from the assumption of perfect foresight and assume that agents do not anticipate
the peg at all. Subsequently, in subsection 6.2, we retain the assumption of per-
fect foresight, but change the way monetary policy is conducted from a standard
Taylor rule to a price-level-targeting rule. Section 7 concludes.

assumption of common knowledge.

2 A model with financial intermediaries
To assess the effects of a government bond purchase program and to be able to
describe under what conditions an interest-rate peg can give rise to a reversal,
we use the fully non-linear version of an estimated New Keynesian model with
financial intermediaries (henceforth FIs) which was recently developed by Carl-
strom et al. (2017). The model differs from "standard" DSGE models (see, for
instance, Fern´
andez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ram´
irez, 2006; Christiano, Eichenbaum
and Evans, 2005; Smets and Wouters, 2007) in the following ways.
Bond market: One key feature leading to the effectiveness of bond purchases
in this model is that the financial market is assumed to be segmented. In par-
ticular, it is assumed that only FIs can purchase long-term bonds in the financial
market. There are two types of long-term bonds available: investment bonds, Ft
,
issued by households and government bonds, Bt
, issued by the government. Fol-
lowing Woodford (2001), long-term investment and long-term government bonds
are modeled as perpetuities, which pay exponentially decaying coupons 1, , 2, ... .
Perpetuities issued at time t pay their first coupon in t + 1, as shown in table 1.
Table 1: Bond pricing
TEXT t t+1 t+2 t+3 t+4

The corresponding price of the perpetuity is given by Qt
= 1/(R10

that the gross yield to maturity (i.e., the discount rate that makes the present
7
value of the bond's stream of promised cash payments equal to its price) is given
by R10
t
= Q-1
t
+ . The duration is calibrated to be ten years (40 quarters), i.e.,
40 = (1 - )(-1), which implies  = 0.975.
Financial intermediaries: In addition to the assumption of a segmented finan-
cial market, the model features financial intermediaries which trade in the financial
market. These FIs use accumulated net worth, Nt
, and (short-term) deposits, Dt
,
to finance purchases of long-term (investment and government) bonds. From the
perspective of the FIs, long-term government bonds and long-term investment
bonds are perfect substitutes. Their balance sheet ­ in real terms ­ is given by

where Lt

and ¯

denote the
real market values of government and investment bonds, respectively.
The ability of FIs to adjust their liability position (for instance, in response to
financial market shocks) is assumed to be limited by two constraints. First, FIs
face quadratic adjustment cost in net worth accumulation; second, FIs are leverage-
constrained, because they face what is known as a "hold-up"problem. This hold-up
problem emerges because FIs can choose to default on obligations to depositors.
If FIs choose to default, depositors can, by assumption, only seize a share (1 - µt
)
of the FIs assets. The remaining share will be kept by FIs. However, the share of
seized assets is assumed to depend on the level of net worth of the FIs as well as on
other state variables. In particular, higher net worth makes the hold-up problem
8
less severe.
To make sure that the FIs will never default on their obligations to depositors, the
value of their expected profits needs to be greater than (or at least equal to) the
value of the share of assets that can be seized in the event of a default. Thus, the
binding time-t incentive compatibility constraint is given by

describes the time-t+1 expected profits (measured in consumption equivalents)
and the right-hand side denotes the value of the share of assets (also measured in
consumption equivalents) that the FIs will seize in the case in which they choose
to default.

from financial intermediaries. In addition, households take into account the law of
motion for physical capital:
Kt
 (1 - )Kt-1

and, in particular, a loan-in-advance constraint, which describes that capital invest-
ment of households needs to be financed by the issuance of long-term investment

denotes household's nominal liabilities at time t, CIt
= (Ft

issuance of new investment bonds, and Qt
denotes the time-t price of newly issued
bonds. As described below, it is mainly through this loan-in-advance constraint
that QE, via its impact on bond prices, is going to have real effects.
The rest of the model is standard in the sense that it exhibits the typical New
Keynesian features. As in Erceg, Henderson and Levin (2000), households are
monopolistic suppliers of differentiated labor inputs Ht
(j). They set wages on a
staggered basis (`
a la Calvo). In each period, the probability of resetting the wage
is (1 - w
), while with the complementary probability the wage is automatically
increased following an indexing rule, Wt

While we incorporate all of the shocks to obtain empirically plausible estimates
for the model's structural parameters (see table 2 in appendix B), we set most
of the shocks to zero when we analyze the reversal puzzle. Specifically, we then
only consider the shocks to the two policy rules, i.e., t
= TR
t
,  ¯
B

. . The first is
needed to implement an interest-rate peg, the latter to trigger the QE program,
which is described formally in the next section.
10The individual equations of the non-linear equilibrium conditions are presented in Appendix
A.

3 Modeling QE and an interest-rate peg
We assume that the government controls the supply of long-term bonds indepen-
dently of macroeconomic conditions. As in Carlstrom et al. (2017), a QE program
is implemented by a persistent AR(2) process for the real market value of long-term
bonds available to the financial intermediaries:

. (15)
This assumption is useful for two reasons: First, the AR(2) process is part of the
model's equilibrium conditions and therefore taken into account by every agent.
Thus, agents perfectly anticipate the path of the outstanding stock (value) of gov-
ernment bonds in the economy once a QE program has been started. Second, the
(inverse) hump shape implied by an AR(2) process is well suited to representing
a plausible QE program: During the phase of purchases, the total value of out-
standing bonds held by the public (i.e., excluding the central bank) declines, while
it returns only gradually to the steady state after the purchases stop eventually ­
in our case after 6 quarters. Technically, the QE program is triggered by a single
shock, i.e.,  ¯
B
t
< 1, that occurs in the first period of the model simulation (see
figure 1).

4 Solution method
We conduct our analysis by solving the non-linear model under perfect foresight,
i.e., the agents in the economy anticipate future shocks perfectly. The model
11One could probably implement the transient interest-rate peg via a non-differentiable func-
tion (i.e., a min- or max-operator). However, this would render the peg endogenous with regard
to its duration. Implementing the peg via the dummy approach allows us to determine the
duration of the peg in a completely exogenous way.
16
equations can be cast into the following general form:
Et
[ (t+1
, t
, t-1
, t
)] = 0, (17)
where Et
denotes the expectation operator,  is a non-linear function, t
summa-
rizes all endogenous variables of the system, and t
includes the two exogenous
variables,  ¯
B
t
and TR
t
. As mentioned, knowledge of the latter shock implies that
the agents in the economy also fully anticipate the interest rate path of monetary
policy. Thus, every component of t
is perfectly known and we can proceed as
if the economy were purely deterministic. That is, we can skip Et
from equation
(17) and stack the set of equilibrium equations (for each of the T periods of the
simulation horizon) as follows:

) = 0
.

 (T+1

We solve the system of stacked equations via Newton's method as described in
Adjemian and Juillard (2014).12 The simulations are initialized at the steady state
­ such that 0
is given ­ and will return to it within our pre-specified simulation
horizon,13 i.e., the initial as well as the terminal state (T+1
) of the simulations
12We implement this procedure using Dynare 4.4.3., which offers several algorithms to solve
models under the assumption of perfect foresight. The appearance of the reversal puzzle is not
a feature of the specific algorithm we use to obtain the subsequent results.
13We set T = 500 to ensure a successful transition between initial and terminal state.

5 The reversal puzzle
5.1 The benchmark case: QE without interest-rate peg
We first consider a QE shock without an accompanying transient interest-rate peg
to describe the transmission of QE in this model. While it is not the primary
focus of our analysis, it shows that the model is perfectly able to reproduce the
conventional result: QE is expansionary and inflationary.
The exogenous process describing the bond purchase program is triggered by a
single shock in the first period of the simulation. As monetary policy follows a
prototypical Taylor rule, TR
t
is zero for all t.

Note: The figure shows responses of (quarterly) output, investment, real investment bonds, net
worth, and the financial distortion in percent deviations from the steady state. Inflation, the
real interest rate, leverage, as well as the short- and long-term rates are measured in
(annualized) percentage point deviations from the steady state.
The transmission can be described as follows. The decreasing supply of long-
term government bonds available for FIs implies an upward pressure on its price
and, correspondingly, lowers its yield to maturity ­ moderately but persistently
(the yield to maturity is given by R10
t
= 1/Qt
+ ). The term premium, too,
decreases (which in the present model is essentially the distortion that is related
to the loan-in-advance constraint).14 The decrease in available bonds leads to a
reduction in banks' net worth and leverage. Thus, the purchase of bonds shortens
the FIs' balance sheet, but net worth mobility is limited due to the portfolio
14Accordingly, the QE program reduces the distortion that is due to market segmentation.
19
adjustment cost.15 Correspondingly, FIs demand for investment bonds increases
(portfolio adjustment). Since investment bonds and government bonds are perfect
substitutes, the price of investment bonds also rises. Therefore, the households'
loan-in-advance constraint is relaxed and, as a result, investment demand increases.
Higher investment demand, in turn, increases aggregate output and so does the
inflation rate. In short, QE is expansionary and inflationary in the present model
and, as a response, monetary policy increases its policy rate if it follows a Taylor
rule.
5.2 Sign reversals: QE with interest rate peg
To illustrate the reversal puzzle that is closely related to the interest-rate peg, we
now assume that the central bank does not follow a Taylor rule but instead keeps
the short-term nominal interest rate unchanged for a pre-announced period of time,
P, alongside its QE program. Arguably, this scenario bears major relevance since
a QE program is typically introduced when the policy rate cannot be lowered any
further. Furthermore, central banks typically do not want to offset the desired
expansionary effect of a QE program by increasing the policy rate.
Figure 3 presents the results for output, inflation, and the short- as well as long-
term rates. Panel (a) shows simulated time paths when the policy rate is kept
constant for up to four periods, i.e., {P  Z | 0  P  4}, panel (b) presents the
corresponding outcomes for {P  Z | 5  P  10}, and panel (c) shows results for
{P  Z | 19  P  25}.
15Note: since net worth mobility is limited, arbitrage opportunities are not eliminated imme-
diately.

Note: The figure shows simulation results for output, inflation, short-term interest rate, and
long-term interest rate based on a QE shock in combination with an interest-rate peg of
duration P. The period zero denotes the steady-state. The QE shock, together with the first
forward guidance shock, occurs in period one. Panel (a) shows results for 0  P  4, panel (b)
shows results for 5  P  10, and panel (c) shows results for 19  P  25.
21
For up to three periods of pegged interest rates, the QE program leads to a com-
paratively modest increase in inflation and output. For a duration of four quarters,
however, the corresponding responses increase markedly. The peak effect of output
for an additional period of pegged rates (i.e., P = 4 compared to P = 3) is about
four times larger.
If we increase the duration of pegged rates further, i.e., 5  P  10 (see panel (b)),
the simulated time series reverse their sign, that is, inflation and output decrease
considerably after the inception of QE. Put differently, for 5  P  10 the model
predicts a severe recession in response to a QE program. Yet, if we increase
the duration of the interest-rate peg even further (see panel (c)), the sign of the
simulated time series switches once again, predicting a rather large expansionary
effect. Thus, in response to a QE shock in combination with an interest-rate peg,
the model variables oscillate with the duration of the peg.
How can such a remarkable reversal be explained? As explained in our introduc-
tion, Carlstrom et al. (2015) argue that in the context of a standard 3-equation
New Keynesian model, it is, in particular, inflation indexation that is an impor-
tant precondition for the sign switch to arise. This is because, if the Phillips curve
entails lagged inflation (which adds an endogenous state variable to the system),
then the terminal level of inflation is no longer exogenous. There is nothing to pin
down the terminal level of inflation at the end of the peg. Consequently, if initial
inflation depends on terminal inflation, but terminal inflation depends on initial
inflation, a counterintuitive reversal may arise. To gain a deeper understanding of
why reversals may occur, we complement the analysis by Carlstrom et al. (2015).
In particular, we first take a closer look at the forward solution of the sub-system
22
of the difference equations. Later on, we complete the discussion by elaborating
on the backward solution.
We consider the linearized version of the model, which we can write in the following
general form:
0

Yt-1
+ t
+ t
. (19)
Yt
denotes the endogenous variables, t
describes the fundamental shocks (for in-
stance, the QE shock or the shock governing the interest-rate peg), and t
indicates
the forecast errors. Following Sims (2001), we apply the QZ decomposition:
Q Z = 0
(20)
Q Z = 1
. (21)
As a result, we can rewrite equation (19) such that
Q  Z Yt

w2,t

. (31)
Since under perfect foresight the transient interest-rate peg is perfectly known to
the agents in the economy, Et
[t+n
] will be nonzero for the time period the central
bank actually fixes the policy rate (i.e., P > 0) and zero afterwards. If some of the
diagonal elements of J turn out to be complex, they can be written in polar form.
Define the complex diagonal elements jj
jj
= zjj
. Then, we can write zjj
= a+bi or
in polar form zjj
= r (cos  + i sin ).16 If now ­ because of known nonzero future
16a describes the real part of a complex eigenvalue and bi describes the imaginary part. While
25
t+n
­ also powers of J enter the solution for w2,t
, we can write (by de Moivre's
formula):
zk
jj
= rk (cos k + i sin k) , for k = 0, ..., P - 1. (32)
Hence, the forward solution of the system involves trigonometric functions, which
depend on the length P of a given interest-rate peg. Thus, the longer the central
bank keeps the policy rate fixed (i.e., the bigger P is), the farther we "move" along
the trigonometric functions contained on the diagonal elements of matrix J. As a
consequence, with an increasing duration of pegged policy rates, the simulations
(which we presented in figure 3) first approach an asymptote (i.e., the effect of an
additional period of pegged policy rates grows exponentially) and afterwards the
simulations switch their sign before they reach another asymptote and switch their
sign again, and so on.
While the reversal completely vanishes if one shuts down inflation indexation in the
context of the 3-equation DNK model, as indicated by Carlstrom et al. (2015), this
should not be expected for the more elaborate medium-sized model presented here,
since this model contains several other backward-looking elements (i.e., endogenous
state variables like capital, wages, net worth, etc.). And it is the interplay of
backward and forward-looking elements in the model that can give rise to complex-
valued eigenvalues and, thus, sign switches in the model's simulations.
a and b are real numbers describing a pair of numerical Cartesian coordinates, r and  denote
the corresponding polar coordinates (i.e., distance and angle).
26
5.3 A sensitivity analysis
One might conjecture that the results thus far depend very much on the specific
parameterization of the model. In this section, we document that this is not the
case. To this end, we conduct an extensive grid search over the model's structural
parameters and illustrate for which duration of the anticipated interest-rate peg
reversals in the initial response of inflation occur. Specifically, we vary each param-
eter one-by-one, holding the other parameters constant at their benchmark values,
to document that the reversal does not arise only for a very specific paramterization
of the model.
The household sector: Figure 4 shows that simply reducing the forward-
lookingness of the agents in the economy by decreasing the discount parameter
 (see subpanel (a) in the upper left), or increasing the backward-lookingness of
the agents by increasing the consumption habit parameter, does not prevent rever-
sals from occuring. We only observe that the duration of the peg that is required
for the reversal to appear changes. For instance, if households discount future
consumption more heavily (a smaller value for ), the peg has to be a few quar-
ters longer in order for the reversal to appear (this is consistent with Carlstrom
et al. (2015) who document that the implementation of a discounted Euler equa-
tion, along the lines of McKay, Nakamura and Steinsson (2016), does not resolve
the reversal puzzle). In addition, variations in the parameters determining the
investment decision of the households (i.e., the capital depreciation rate  and the
capital adjustment costs i
shown in the subpanels (c) and (d)) do not prevent
sign switches.

The firm sector: Figure 5 presents results from our grid search over the param-
eter values which drive the behavior of the price and wage setters (i.e., the Calvo
parameters for prices, p
, and wages, w
, as well as the parameters for price and
wage indexation, p
and w
). Once again, we observe that the required duration of
the interest-rate peg in order for the reversal to appear, varies with different pa-
rameter values. However, we observe that if firms behave in a less forward-looking
manner (i.e., for Calvo parameters for prices and wages > 0.9), the peg has to be
28
a few years longer in order for the reversal to appear.

thirty quarters. Again, the blue points indicate a different sign compared to the scenario
without interest-rate peg. The red line marks the calibrated value for the respective
parameters, which were used to carry out the analysis in subsections 5.1 and 5.2.
It should be noted that even if we shut down price and wage indexation jointly
(i.e., p
= 0 and w
= 0) and re-run all the grids for all structural parameter values,
sign reversals still occur. Thus, beyond indexation, there remain elements in the
present model that produce sign switches.
29
Monetary policy: Figure 6, finally, presents the results from a grid search over
the Taylor-rule coefficients, which become active, of course, only after the peg has
ended.17 As before, the occurrence of sign switches in the simulations does not
depend on individual parameter values. Only the length of the peg, for which the
reversal occurs, is affected by changes of the parameters. In particular, a more
aggressive inflation stabilization (i.e., a higher coefficient 
) requires a longer
duration of the interest-rate peg in order for the reversal to occur. Introducing
history dependence by means of interest rate smoothing does not prevent reversals
from occurring, either; see upper left panel in figure 6.
17Note that the agents perfectly anticipate the duration of forward guidance. Thus, they are
perfectly aware of the point in time at which the Taylor rule is in place again.

6 Overcoming the reversal puzzle
6.1 No anticipation
Thus far, we have illustrated that the reversal puzzle is a very robust feature of the
simulation set-up. Due to the presence of complex-valued eigenvalues, the model's
dynamics switch sign, depending on the duration of a temporary interest-rate peg.
31
However, the complex eigenvalues on the main diagonal of the matrix J only imply
a sign switch in the model simulations if the agents anticipate the interest-rate peg
(i.e., Et
[t+n
] = 0). Thus, an obvious modification is to assume that agents do not
anticipate the interest-rate peg. Instead, they are surprised each period that the
interest rate is kept constant.
To examine such a scenario, we use a procedure that has recently also been em-
ployed by Arias, Erceg and Trabandt (2016), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Tra-
bandt (2015), and Adjemian and Juillard (2013). In contrast to the perfect fore-
sight approach, the endogenous variables are now computed by running a deter-
ministic simulation for each period of the simulation horizon with the previous
period as an initial condition for the next period and the steady state as terminal
condition. In each period, agents now expect that the exogenous shocks will be
zero for all future periods, i.e., they assume Et
(t+n
) = 0. Less technically, they
expect that monetary policy does not peg its policy rate for an extended period of
time P. Thus, at every step of the simulation (i.e., in each period), future shocks
will not be anticipated, which implies that certainty equivalence applies. Figure 7
presents the corresponding simulation results.

Note: The figure shows simulation results for output, inflation, short-term interest rate, and
long-term interest rate, based on a QE shock in combination with an unanticipated
interest-rate peg of duration P, with 0  P  10. The period zero denotes the steady state.
The QE shock, together with the first forward guidance shock, occurs in period one. The
simulations are carried out based on the assumption that both price and wage indexation are
present (i.e., p
= 0.3876 and w
= 0.3807).
In the absence of anticipation, the dynamics of aggregate output and inflation
neither explode nor reverse their sign, even if we extend the duration of the peg
considerably. To see why this is the case, consider equation (31), which we show
here again for convenience:
w2,t
= -Et

n=1
Jn-1-1
22
Q2
t+n
. (33)
Recall: we solve the non-linear model for each period of the entire simulation
33
horizon. In each period, the model is solved under the assumption that t+n
= 0
for all n > 0. Thus, now the solution for w2,t
does not depend on the matrix J
anymore, such that the corresponding complex eigenvalues are no longer relevant.
As a consequence, the simulated time paths of the model will not move along the
trigonometric functions resulting from the complex elements on the main diagonal
of matrix J. Thus, the explosive complex eigenvalues cannot induce explosive
or cyclical effects in the solution of w2,t
. The model-implied dynamics following
a QE shock and a corresponding implementation of a transient interest-rate peg
therefore deliver orthodox results.
6.2 Price-level targeting
While the anticipation of the interest-rate peg and therefore the expectations of
the agents about future shocks are key to understanding the reversal puzzle, it is
somewhat unrealistic, or at least unattractive, to assume, as in the last section,
that agents are not able to take into account announced monetary policy measures
like forward guidance. We now present a way of overcoming the puzzle without
imposing such a strong assumption.
An effective way of making a noteworthy change in what agents expect is to as-
sume that monetary policy follows a price-level-targeting rule after the nominal
interest-rate peg. Indeed, price-level targeting is known to be able to induce stabi-
lization effects, even if the interest rate is kept constant. This is because price-level
targeting implies history dependence of monetary policy, which in turn strengthens
the expectations channel.
34
To illustrate the consequences of such a change in the monetary policy strategy, we
therefore substitute the Taylor rule in Equation (16) with the following price-level
targeting rule:
Rt
= TR
t
(Rss
) + 1 - TR
t
(Rt-1
) Rss
Pp
t
Yt
Yt-1
y 1-
, (34)
where Pt
describes the price level, and p
the response coefficient of monetary pol-
icy to deviations of the price level from its target (which is equal to one in our
analysis).

Figure 8 shows the results from a corresponding grid search analysis. The `empty'
figure highlights that if the monetary authority switches to a price-level-targeting
rule, the reversal puzzle completely vanishes, even for much longer durations of
35
pegged policy rates, i.e., for more than fifteen years. Why is this the case? The
main difference between inflation targeting and price-level targeting is that, under
the former strategy, shocks to the price level are treated as bygones. Thus, a
policy that aims at keeping the future inflation rate close to a given target value
in the medium term, will not correct for past shocks. Instead, under price-level
targeting, the central bank commits itself to correcting deviations of the price level
from its target. Thus, if there is a shock that pushes the price level away from the
target price path, future inflation will be required to adjust in a way to bring the
price path back to target. As a result, past deviations from target are corrected
under price-level targeting. If monetary policy is credible, the forward-looking
rational agents are going to expect a complete correction of past deviations. This,
in turn, dampens agents' expectations about output and inflation deviations and
therefore mitigates the expansionary effect of the anticipated nominal interest-rate
peg together with the expansionary QE program on output and inflation from the
very beginning. Due to the muted output and inflation responses, sign reversals
do not occur even for very long durations of pegged nominal interest rates. Put
differently, the response of inflation to, for instance, a series of forward guidance
shocks (i.e., shocks governing the nominal interest-rate peg, TR
t
) will neither grow
exponentially and reach an asymptote nor will it reverse its sign.

Note: The figure shows simulations for output, inflation, and the short- as well as long-term
interest rates, for an increasing duration of a pegged policy rate (i.e., zero to ten periods). The
period zero denotes the steady state. The QE shock, together with the first forward guidance
shock, occurs in period one.
Figure 9 presents the simulated time paths for output, inflation, and the short-
as well as long-term interest rate. The model implies plausible dynamics under
reasonable policy scenarios, and even more importantly, the simulations do not
change dramatically for only minor changes in the policy scenario.
It is important to note that, with the price-level-targeting specification, the com-
plex eigenvalues, showing up in the solution of the system, do not vanish (see also
table 3 in appendix C). Put differently, the existence of complex eigenvalues is thus
merely a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the reversal to appear. Intu-
itively, to observe a reversal, the complex eigenvalues of the forward and backward
37
solution have to `interact' in a very specific way. To understand why these complex
eigenvalues do not induce cyclical effects in the case of price-level targeting ­ even
though there are anticipated future shocks hitting the system ­ we have to take a
look at the solution of the system of difference equations as a whole.
Having already solved for w2,t
in equation (31), the final step is to solve for w1,t
.
Following Sims (2001) again, we consider the unique solution of the system18 in
terms of wt

] , which is formulated below as

In contrast to the forward solution (i.e., the solution for w2,t
), the matrices 11
,
12
, and  now enter the expression for the solution of the stable part of the
system (i.e., the solution for w1,t
). This implies that these matrices may govern
the whole system in such a way that the complex eigenvalues contained in both
the stable and the unstable parts may 'cancel' each other out in the system. If
this is the case, anticipated future shocks will no longer induce cyclical effects in
the simulation of the model.
To reiterate, given the assumption of perfect foresight, the presence of complex
eigenvalues in the solution of the system is only a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for the reversal puzzle to appear. It seems to be the balance between
stable and unstable complex elements in the solution of the model that matters.
39
This reinforces the suggestion by Carlstrom et al. (2015), who argue that the
source of the reversal puzzle is a feedback between forward and backward-looking
factors of the underlying model. To us, this explanation is mirrored in the complex
elements of the solution of the underlying system of difference equations.
7 Conclusion
The reversal puzzle is one of several peculiarities (like the forward guidance puzzle,
paradox of toil etc.) that the New Keynesian model can produce when the nominal
interest rate is constrained due to the zero lower bound or a temporary interest rate
peg. In this study, we demonstrate that the reversal puzzle is a relevant and tena-
cious phenomenon in a medium-scale DSGE model (with many endogenous state
variables) by analyzing a plausible policy scenario in which the model economy is
affected by a QE program and forward guidance.
We provide results from extensive numerical research suggesting that the rever-
sal puzzle appears for a wide range of different parameterizations of the model
under investigation. In particular, we show that the reversal puzzle is not just
the outcome of an irrelevant or negligible parameter constellation. It is rather
an empirically relevant part of the overall parameter space that delivers inflation
reversals for plausible durations of forward guidance.
We discuss two modifications of our analysis to overcome the reversal puzzle which
shed light on the important role of agents' expectations in delivering the puzzle.
The first modification is to assume that agents in the model economy act under
certainty equivalence, i.e., they take the nominal interest-rate peg into account
40
only contemporaneously, but expect the peg to be absent in the future. The
second modification is to assume a price-level targeting rule instead of a Taylor rule
while keeping the assumption of perfect foresight. Both modifications suggest the
conclusion that the reversal puzzle disappears when expectations do not respond
strongly to future shocks ­ in the first modification because the agents do not
take into account future shocks at all (and, correspondingly, do not adjust their
expectations), and in the second modification because the agents expect the central
bank to fully correct for the shocks that make the price level deviate from its target
path (which implies that agents correspondingly adjust their inflation expectations
from the very beginning).
The modifications we present to overcome the reversal puzzle illustrate the mech-
anisms and the determinants of the puzzle, contributing to a better understanding
of the phenomenon as such. However, in a sense, they are not practical solutions:
Having a specific (policy) analysis in mind, there might be good reasons not to
assume certainty equivalence or a central bank targeting the price level, not least
because these elements might be undesirable from an empirical point of view. De-
veloping practical solutions in this sense might be a promising avenue for future
research.
