 Adults: Further Evidence That Perceived Risks and
 Disapproval Lead to Reduced Drug Use

 This paper explores alternative explanations for the recent sharp decline in
 cocaine use among high school seniors, using questionnaire data from annual
 nationwide surveys conducted from 1976 through 1988. Results show important
 parallels with earlier analyses of the longer-term decline in marijuana use.
 Although lifestyle factors (e.g., religious commitment, truancy, evenings out for
 fun and recreation) show strong links with use of marijuana and cocaine, these
 factors have not developed trends in ways that can account for the declines in use
 of either drug. Reported availability of either drug has not been reduced. Instead,
 increases in perceived risks and disapproval appear to have contributed
 substantially to the recent declines in use of marijuana and cocaine. The findings
 provide strong support for the use of realistic information about risks and
 consequences as an important ingredient in efforts to prevent drug use. Coupled
 with the findings on availability, the results emphasize the importance of efforts to
 reduce demand (as opposed to supply).

 It is hard to imagine any dimension of
 behavior in the last two or three decades that
 has changed more dramatically, or with more
 worrisome implications, than the use of illicit
 drugs by youths and young adults. Marijuana
 has been the most widely used; rates rose
 during the late 1960s and most of the 1970s,
 so that by 1979 fully two-thirds of young
 adults (age 18 to 25) and nearly as many high
 school seniors reported some consumption of
 the drug (Fishburne, Abelson, and Cisin
 1980; Johnston, O'Malley, and Bachman
 1989; National Institute on Drug Abuse
 1988). Yet 1979 was a turning point; during
 the 1980s marijuana use among seniors and

 recent graduates declined steadily (Johnston
 et al. 1989; O'Malley, Bachman, and Johnston
 1988). The use of cocaine, a more dangerous
 illicit drug, followed a different trajectory;
 prevalence rose during the late 1970s, re-
 mained relatively unchanged during the first
 half of the 1980s, and then dropped by about
 40 percent between 1986 and 1988 (Johnston
 et al. 1989).

 Although the declines in rates of use for

 marijuana and for cocaine began at different
 points in time, they have two important
 features in common: 1) each was accompa-
 nied by a sharp shift in attitudes about the
 drug and 2) in each case the decline in use
 was not accompanied by any decline in
 perceived availability of the drug. For some
 years we have offered the hypothesis that the
 more danger young people associate with a
 drug, the less likely they will be to use it
 (e.g., Johnston 1982; Johnston, Bachman,
 and O'Malley 1981). In the case of mari-
 juana, some of the earliest supporting evi-
 dence came in the form of the cross-time

 this hypothesis. In the present paper we
 examine more closely the link between
 changed attitudes about cocaine and the
 decline in its use; again we test the competing
 hypothesis that a general shift toward more
 conservative lifestyles might explain more
 clearly the recent downturn in cocaine use
 which has been occurring since 1986.

 Following the strategy used in our recent
 analysis of marijuana, we divide predictors
 (i.e., correlates) of cocaine use into two
 categories: 1) individual "lifestyle variables,"
 which relate not only to cocaine use but also
 to other drug use, delinquent behavior, and a
 variety of other "problem" behaviors, and 2)
 drug-specific factors, in this case those which
 relate directly to cocaine use. Although this
 distinction is too sharp and too simple to
 correspond fully to the real world, nonethe-
 less it continues to be a useful way of
 organizing our data and analyses.

 The lifestyle factors again include grades,
 truancy, hours worked per week, average
 weekly income, religious commitment, polit-
 ical liberalism/conservatism, and frequency
 of evenings out for recreation. Sex of
 respondent is also included, in part as a proxy
 for other lifestyle factors not measured.

 The earlier analysis of marijuana examined
 two drug-specific factors, perceived risk of
 marijuana use and disapproval of marijuana
 use, and found that changes in these dimen-
 sions could account for virtually all of the
 secular trends in marijuana use from 1976
 through 1986 (Bachman et al. 1988). The
 present analyses focus on another drug and
 another set of drug-specific dimensions,
 perceived risk of cocaine use and disapproval
 of cocaine use. We also include some data on
 another drug-specific dimension, availability
 (or, more accurately, perceived availability).

 aggregate-level trends in attitudes and use.
 Additional evidence supporting this interpre-
 tation was reported by Johnston (1982, 1985),
 who showed that concerns about marijuana's
 effects on physical and psychological health
 were among the leading reasons given by
 seniors for abstaining from or quitting mari-
 juana use, and that the proportions of
 abstainers or quitters mentioning these rea-
 sons were increasing.

 A more recent paper examined in detail the
 link between attitude changes and the decline
 in marijuana use (Bachman, Johnston, O'Ma-
 lley, and Humphrey 1988). This analysis
 explored two possible contrasting explana-
 tions for the decline in marijuana use: 1) that
 young people have become more conservative
 in general, or 2) that specific changes in
 views about marijuana have led to the decline
 in use. We reached two broad conclusions.
 First, we found that "although individual
 differences in lifestyle are very important in
 understanding individual variations in mari-
 juana use, the data offer no support for the
 proposition that any sort of overall conserva-
 tive shift underlies the recent decline in
 marijuana use" (p. 107). Second, we noted
 that perceived risks of regular marijuana use,
 as well as personal disapproval of such use,
 rose sharply between 1978 and 1986; we
 concluded that "if there had not been a
 distinct increase in negative attitudes about
 marijuana, we would not have found steadily
 lower levels of marijuana use in each
 succeeding class of high school seniors since
 1979" (p. 107).

 While this appreciable decline in marijuana

 use was occurring during the first half of the
 1980s, cocaine use remained at peak levels
 despite growing governmental efforts to
 contain its use. The national strategy was
 weighted heavily toward reduction of supply,
 but the empirical evidence, including our own
 trend data from seniors on perceived availabil-
 ity, suggested that the strategy was not
 working. Our belief that risk-related attitudes
 were important determinants of the secular
 trends in marijuana use led us to conclude that
 a shift in young people's perceptions of the
 risks associated with cocaine use-in particu-
 lar with experimental and occasional use-
 would be necessary to achieve a reduction in
 use (e.g., Johnston, O'Malley, and Bachman
 1984, 1985). The trends we eventually
 observed in perceived risk, disapproval, and
 active use of cocaine offer some support for

 METHODS

 Subjects

 The data for these analyses were obtained
 from the "Monitoring the Future" project, an
 ongoing study of youths conducted by the
 Institute for Social Research, which has
 surveyed a nationally representative sample of
 high school seniors each year since 1975. The
 study design is described briefly in our
 previous report (Bachman et al. 1988), and
 has been described extensively elsewhere

 (Bachman and Johnston 1978; Bachman,
 Johnston, and O'Malley 1987; Johnston et al.
 1989). The present analyses are based on
 group-administered questionnaire data col-
 lected from seniors in 13 graduating classes,
 1976 through 1988.

 About 17,000 seniors are surveyed each
 year; annual sample sizes reported here,
 however, are just over 3,000 because each
 annual survey includes five different question-
 naire forms, and the items dealing with
 beliefs and attitudes about drugs appear on
 single forms. Because of the large numbers of
 cases, sampling errors are very small; any
 relationship that we treat as substantively
 important far surpasses conventional stan-
 dards for statistical significance.'

 items in all questionnaire forms, along with
 response distributions and missing data rates,
 have been published separately (see Bachman
 et al. 1987 and prior volumes in the same
 series). The analyses reported here focus on
 the measure of drug use during the previous
 12 months. Recent analysis based on four
 waves of panel data yielded reliability esti-
 mates of .82 for the 12-month measure of
 cocaine use and .88 for the 12-month measure
 of marijuana use, calculated by the Wiley and
 Wiley (1970) method.

 earlier findings: both perceived risk and
 disapproval associated with marijuana use
 declined slightly during the first year or two
 and then rose strongly and steadily during the
 1980s, while self-reported use of marijuana
 initially increased and subsequently declined
 steadily. The figure also shows that perceived
 availability of marijuana remained nearly
 unchanged; throughout the whole period the
 great majority (85%-90%) of seniors thought
 it would be fairly easy or very easy to obtain
 marijuana. Thus it seems clear that availabil-
 ity did not play an important role in the recent
 changes in marijuana use, at least in those
 changes which occurred in the last decade or
 so.

 The trends involving cocaine, also dis-
 played in Figure 1, match the findings for
 marijuana in that the trend in self-reported
 cocaine use shows a fairly close inverse
 relationship to the trends in perceived risks
 and in disapproval, particularly during the
 recent period in which cocaine use was
 declining. (Because the mean rates of cocaine
 use are very low, it is difficult to detect the
 trends on the scale used in Figure 1; in order
 to present those findings more clearly, we
 added the dotted line showing the trend in
 cocaine use multiplied by three.) Again as in
 the pattern for marijuana, the decline in

 cocaine use could not be linked to availability
 because perceived availability actually rose
 somewhat during the recent decline in use.

 In several other ways, however, the
 findings for cocaine and those for marijuana,
 as shown in Figure 1, are substantially
 different. We note first that the perceived
 availability of cocaine shifted much more
 strongly over this period than did the
 perceived availability of marijuana; in partic-
 ular, during the late 1970s, when self-
 reported cocaine use was increasing, increas-
 ing proportions of seniors also felt that they
 could obtain cocaine if they desired it. Other
 contrasts also exist between the two drugs;
 throughout the study period cocaine was
 perceived as more dangerous than marijuana,
 was disapproved more strongly, was seen as
 less easily available, and was used less
 frequently and by smaller proportions of
 seniors.

 In sum, Figure 1 shows that attitudes and
 behaviors regarding cocaine have differed
 from those regarding marijuana in many
 respects. Yet the figure also shows clearly the
 two points of consistency across drugs that we
 mentioned earlier: for each drug the decline in
 use was accompanied (or preceded) by 1)
 increases in perceived risk and disapproval
 but 2) no decline in perceived availability.

 detail elsewhere (Bachman, Johnston, and

 First, over all 13 senior classes there is a
 great deal of consistency in relationships
 between lifestyle factor and cocaine use-the
 same factors that are predictive in one year
 are also predictive in other years. Specifi-
 cally, high school seniors at greatest risk for
 involvement in cocaine use have been males,
 those with poorer grades, those high in
 truancy, those who work long hours in
 part-time jobs (during the school year), those
 with relatively high incomes (linked, of
 course, to long hours of part-time work),
 those with little or no commitment to religion,
 those who describe their political preferences
 as radical, and those who frequently spend
 evenings out "for fun and recreation."

 Second, there have been no very large
 secular trends in these lifestyle factors-
 certainly none of a size and pattern that would
 be likely to explain the recent trends in
 cocaine use.

 Does controlling any one of the lifestyle
 factors have the effect of eliminating the
 secular trend in cocaine use? We found that it
 clearly does not. We examined each subgroup
 for each of the lifestyle measures, with results
 of the sort illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. In
 virtually every subgroup, cocaine use rose
 from 1976 through 1980 and declined from
 1986 through 1988. Even so, there are
 important subgroup differences in the strength
 of the secular trend; the pattern is always
 more pronounced for those in the "higher-
 risk" categories. As Figure 2 shows, among
 seniors who reported relatively high rates of
 truancy, mean cocaine use rose sharply from
 1976 through 1980 and declined sharply from
 1986 through 1988; among seniors who
 reported no truancy, however, these differ-
 ences from one class to another are much
 weaker. Similarly, the findings in Figure 3
 show the most pronounced secular trend
 among the "higher-risk" individuals (those
 lowest in religious commitment). Here again,
 however, the overall secular trend is discern-

 Trends in Cocaine Use,
 with Attitudes Controlled

 What happens to the secular trend in
 cocaine use if we control either perceived
 risks or disapproval? We reported above that
 for every category of each of the lifestyle
 variables, the same basic secular trend in
 cocaine use was evident. In other words, the
 secular trend did not disappear in the face of
 (bivariate) "controls" for lifestyle factors. For
 the attitude variables, however, the story is
 quite different, as illustrated in Figure 4.
 Practically none of the seniors with strongly
 anticocaine attitudes reported any use of the
 drug, no matter in which year; thus there was
 no room for a downturn to occur in the
 1986-to-1988 interval. At the other end of the
 attitude continuum, among seniors in the
 small (and, in recent years, shrinking)
 categories expressing the most "accepting"
 attitudes regarding cocaine, rates of use rose
 from 1976 through 1979 and showed mostly
 random fluctuations thereafter. The trends
 shown in Figure 4 contrast sharply with those
 in Figures 2 and 3; specifically, we do not
 observe a clear downturn in use when we
 control levels of perceived risk (see Bachman
 et al. 1989, Table 3, for further details).

 These bivariate analyses suggest a conclu-
 sion that parallels (in its general form) the one
 we reached earlier with respect to marijuana:

 ceived Risk of Trying Cocaine: High
 School Seniors, 1976-1988

 < 2 1 . r No risk

 if there had not been a substantial secular
 trend in attitudes and beliefs about cocaine,
 starting in about 1986, the (smaller) down-
 ward secular trend in cocaine use very likely
 would not have occurred.

 Multivariate Analyses Combining Lifestyle
 Factors, Attitudes, and Secular Trends

 All of the preceding analyses involved
 separate computations for each of 13 classes
 of high school seniors. We noted parallels
 among trends (Figure 1); we also observed
 that in each class cocaine use was linked
 consistently to a number of lifestyle factors
 and was correlated strongly with both per-
 ceived risks and disapproval. Now we turn to
 the task of discovering how these several sets
 of trends and correlations are interrelated.

 Our multivariate analyses employ the same
 strategy as we used in studying the recent
 decline in marijuana use (Bachman et al.
 1988). We computed product-moment corre-
 lations (two matrices, one based on question-
 naire Form 5 data and the other based on
 questionnaire Form 3 data), carried out
 multiple regression analyses using various
 sets of predictors, and compared predictor
 sets to ascertain unique and overlapping
 portions of explained variance. The analyses
 are somewhat unusual because 1) the correla-
 tion matrices pooled data across cohorts
 (graduating classes) and 2) we assigned a new
 variable to each individual, consisting of the
 mean cocaine use (during the previous 12
 months) reported by all seniors during the
 year in which the individual graduated. Thus
 we were able to include in each matrix the
 correlation between individual cocaine use
 and mean cocaine use among seniors for that
 year. We interpret that correlation as reflect-
 ing the extent to which individual variance in
 cocaine use over a number of years is
 "explainable" or "interpretable" in terms of
 the overall secular trend in use. Accordingly
 we sometimes refer to mean use per year as a
 measure of the secular trend in cocaine use.

 Our initial regression analyses involving
 cocaine use included all 13 classes (1976
 through 1988). The results did not replicate
 fully our findings for marijuana. Specifically,
 we found that attitudes about cocaine could
 not account fully for secular trends in cocaine
 use across the 13 years. This result was not
 altogether surprising because we had noted

 already that the period of sharp increase in
 cocaine use during the late 1970s was not
 accompanied by equally sharp changes in
 perceived risks or disapproval. Because we
 focus primarily on declines in use linked to
 increases in perceived risk and disapproval,
 we repeated the analyses focusing only on the
 four graduating classes of 1985 through 1988.

 of perceived risk correlates more strongly
 with cocaine use than does the whole group of
 predictors in Set A, and that the single
 measure of disapproval correlates still more
 strongly.

 The most important stage in the multivari-
 ate analysis is reached when we consider
 whether there is any relationship unique to the
 secular trend measure when either of the
 attitude measures is included in the equation.
 Here, although the coefficients are smaller
 than in our analysis of marijuana, the pattern
 of findings leads to exactly the same
 conclusion: in the presence of either of the
 attitude measures, the secular trend effect is
 reduced essentially to zero (on the basis of a
 comparison of Set B with Set B + C). The
 same finding emerges when we include the
 Set A variables (comparing Set A + B with
 Set A+B+C).

 In sum, the regression analyses of cocaine
 use reported in Table 2, like our earlier
 analyses of marijuana use, show that the
 recent downturn in use cannot be explained in
 terms of the lifestyle measures included in Set
 A, but can be explained in terms of increases
 in perceived risks and/or in disapproval.

 The statement above is specific to the
 recent decline in cocaine use; as noted earlier,
 changes in perceived risk and disapproval do
 not provide an adequate explanation for the
 rise in cocaine use that was observed in the
 late 1970s.2

 Explaining the rise in cocaine use must
 involve other variables; the same is probably
 true for marijuana and for other illicit drugs.
 We discuss this matter briefly in the next
 section.

 (Set C) mean cocaine use for all seniors
 during year of graduation (secular trend in
 cocaine use).

 The lifestyle variables in Set A account for
 about 9 percent of the variance in annual
 cocaine use. This finding contrasts sharply
 with the 25 percent of variance in marijuana
 use explained by the same set of variables in
 our earlier analysis; the lower explained
 variance is not surprising, however, when we
 consider that cocaine involves many fewer
 users and much less frequent use than
 marijuana. Here again, consistent with our
 earlier findings (Bachman et al. 1981, 1988),
 the standardized regression coefficients show
 that truancy, religious commitment, and
 evenings out are the most important predic-
 tors. (Grades also are important, but overlap
 somewhat with the truancy measure.)

 Looking next at Set C, we find that the
 overall secular trend in cocaine use can
 account for only a very small amount of
 variance in individual use (about 0.4%).
 (Incidentally, the comparable figure for the
 full 13-year interval from 1976 to 1988 is
 scarcely larger-about 0.5%.) Here, as for
 marijuana, the findings remind us that
 although the recent year-to-year declines are
 important and interesting, such variations
 remain small in comparison to the range of
 individual variability among seniors within
 each year of the study.

 The separate findings for Sets A and C
 show clearly that if one wished to predict
 cocaine use by a high school senior during
 recent years, knowing the senior's frequency
 of evenings out, religious involvement, and
 adjustment in school would be far more useful
 than knowing the year of graduation. Yet
 when we observe the regression findings for
 Set A + C, it is clear that we can predict even
 more accurately using both types of predic-
 tors. The key point here is that including the
 lifestyle variables (Set A) as predictors does
 not at all diminish the relationship with the
 secular trend measure. In fact, the regression
 coefficient for the secular trend measure is
 increased slightly in the presence of Set A
 predictors, and the variance unique to secular
 trend rises slightly to 0.5 percent-calculated
 by subtracting the R-squared value for Set A
 from the R-squared value for Set A + C. In
 other words, none of the secular trend can be
 "explained" by the lifestyle variables.

 Finally, Set B shows clearly (as in our

 analysis of marijuana) that the single measure

 DISCUSSION

 In this paper we set out to learn more about

 the recent decline in cocaine use among high
 school seniors; in particular, we suspected
 that the decline was caused by recent
 increases in perceived risks and disapproval
 associated with cocaine use. We repeated the
 strategies and procedures used in our earlier
 analysis of the decline in marijuana use
 (Bachman et al. 1988); the basic results
 replicate our earlier findings. In some other
 respects, however, the findings for cocaine
 stand in contrast to those for marijuana; yet
 several of these differences actually tend to

 strengthen our general conclusions about
 factors underlying trends in drug use.

 For example, seniors have been far more
 likely to view cocaine use as risky and as
 something to be disapproved than has been
 the case for marijuana (see Figure 1). In
 keeping with those differences, actual use of
 cocaine among seniors has been much lower
 than marijuana use (and because of the
 resulting lower variance, our correlations
 involving cocaine use tend to be smaller than
 those involving marijuana use). Thus we find
 it all the more important that in spite of large
 differences in attitudes, rates of use, and size
 of correlations, the present findings linking
 attitude changes to the decline in cocaine use
 have so much in common with our earlier
 findings about the decline in marijuana use.

 Another significant difference between
 marijuana and cocaine involves seniors'
 estimates of how easy it would be to obtain
 each drug. Marijuana consistently has been
 viewed by large majorities as readily avail-
 able, whereas the mean ratings of cocaine
 availability have been much lower. Thus
 availability (or at least perceived availability)
 may have been much more of a limiting factor
 in the case of cocaine. Although perceived
 availability of cocaine rose appreciably during
 the late 1970s, when use also was rising, it is
 important to recall that during the recent
 decline in cocaine use there was no decline in
 perceived availability. Thus our findings for
 cocaine, like those for marijuana, show that
 use can decline without any corresponding
 decline in perceived supply. (It is quite
 possible, however, that the earlier rise in
 perceived availability may have facilitated the
 rise in cocaine use.)

 One other distinction between the findings

 for marijuana and for cocaine, particularly
 important for our present conclusions, in-
 volves the shape and the timing of the secular
 trends in use. Although use of both drugs
 increased until 1978, the trends were dis-
 tinctly different after that. Marijuana use
 declined fairly steadily from 1979 onward, so
 that by 1988 annual usage rates (either mean
 use or percentage reporting any use) were
 about half as large as for the class of 1979.
 For cocaine, however, the first clear decline
 did not occur until after the 1986 survey; then
 it was so steep that only two years later
 annual use had fallen by about 40 percent.

 We would find it hard to argue plausibly

 that such different secular trends in the use of

 these two drugs could have been caused by
 some general trend among young people
 toward becoming more "conservative" or less
 "trouble-prone" in recent years. (Moreover,
 such an argument would be strained further to
 accommodate still other trend patterns for
 other drugs.) Changes in drug-specific fac-
 tors, on the other hand, correspond clearly to
 the declines in both marijuana use and
 cocaine use. As displayed in Figure 1,
 perceived risks and disapproval regarding
 marijuana rose steadily from 1978 or 1979
 onward; in the case of cocaine, perceived
 risks and disapproval rose sharply after 1986.
 Both the bivariate and the multivariate
 analyses suggest strongly that if these changes
 in attitudes about each drug had not occurred,
 we would not have observed any recent
 declines in use.

 We have not attempted in this -paper to

 formulate an overall theory of drug use, nor
 have we undertaken the (slightly) more
 limited task of formulating a theory of secular
 trends in drug use (but see Johnston forthcom-
 ing for an initial effort in the latter direction).
 The present findings, however, prompt two
 observations that would seem appropriate to
 incorporate into any general theory of drug
 use and trends in such use. First, it seems
 necessary to include drug-specific factors in
 any complete explication of drug use. Broad
 theories of deviant or "problem" behavior are
 valuable and highly relevant to the use of
 drugs, but they cannot provide a complete
 explanation-particularly because different
 drugs have shown such disparate patterns of
 secular trends. Second, it is not necessarily
 the case that those factors which play a major
 role in the decline in use of a drug are those
 which contributed most substantially to an
 initial increase in use. To the contrary, we
 suspect that the factors causing historical rises
 and declines in a drug's use are seldom the
 same. With regard to marijuana and cocaine,
 for example, changes in availability undoubt-
 edly played a more important role in the
 increase of each drug's use than in the
 decline.

 Our emphasis on drug-specific factors does
 not preclude some very useful generalizations
 across drugs. Indeed, the central thesis of this
 paper-that increases in perceived risks and
 disapproval underlie the recent downturn in
 use of cocaine-is a generalization from the
 earlier findings on marijuana.

 Now let us consider why these attitudes

 about marijuana and cocaine changed. We
 have argued on several occasions that changes
 in the social environment, primarily changes
 in information about marijuana, led to a
 secular trend in perceptions of the risks of
 marijuana, which led in turn to secular trends
 in disapproval and in actual marijuana use
 (e.g., Bachman et al. 1988; Johnston 1985).
 In particular, we think that two kinds of social
 change were involved, no doubt synergistically:
 1) there was increased research and more
 credible reporting on the physical and psycho-
 logical consequences of marijuana use, and 2)
 long-term heavy marijuana use became com-
 mon enough that most high school students
 knew classmates who exhibited some of these
 negative consequences.

 In the case of cocaine as well, we believe
 that shifts in attitudes resulted from changes
 in the social environment, primarily changes
 in information specific to cocaine. These
 shifts occurred much more abruptly than
 those involving marijuana, most likely be-
 cause the new information about cocaine
 arrived in such a dramatic fashion. In May
 1986 Len Bias, a college basketball star who
 had just made sports headlines as the
 first-round draft pick of the Boston Celtics,
 died as a result of cocaine use. The extensive
 press coverage of this tragedy included the
 assertion that Bias had never used cocaine
 before the occasion which resulted in his
 death. Although that statement was discov-
 ered later to be incorrect, the early publicity
 left a strong impression that even trying
 cocaine could be very dangerous. Within
 several weeks another sports star, profes-
 sional football player Don Rogers, also died
 as a result of cocaine use.

 Although these two athletes were not high
 school seniors, they were only a few years
 older than the respondents in our study, they
 were young men in prime physical condition,
 and they had already achieved a high degree
 of success and fame. In other words, they
 were the kinds of individuals with whom
 many high school students could identify.
 Thus we suspect that for many young people
 these widely reported and discussed events
 had at least some of the impact that would
 have resulted from a classmate's death due to
 cocaine. In any case, the Bias and Rogers
 deaths, coming in rapid succession, provided
 a focal point for extensive media coverage of
 cocaine use and its risks (including death rate
 statistics, other physical effects, addictive

 potential, and the like); all of this information
 seemed likely to generate higher levels of
 public concern about the drug. The findings
 reported here suggest that this is exactly what
 happened.

 CONCLUSIONS

 In this paper we have concentrated on only
 one part of the drug use picture, albeit a very
 important part. We have focused on overall
 secular trends, not on intra-individual changes;
 more precisely, our focus has been on recent
 substantial declines in drug use. The present
 findings regarding cocaine, combined with
 the earlier findings concerning marijuana,
 support several observations and conclusions.
 First, it seems clear that neither the recent
 decline in cocaine use nor the decline in
 marijuana use can be attributed to any overall
 shifts in a number of general lifestyle factors.
 These factors themselves have not shown
 strong trends in recent years; therefore,
 controlling them (in multivariate regression
 analyses) did not reduce the size of the
 secular trend in either cocaine use or
 marijuana use. Moreover, trends in drug use
 that differ so widely in timing and in rate of
 change are unlikely to have identical causes.
 It appears instead that drug-specific factors
 were responsible for each of the declines in
 drug use. In particular, increases in perceived
 risk and in disapproval associated with each
 drug seem to have prompted the declines in
 use.

 The drug-specific factors involved in declin-
 ing use are not necessarily the same as those
 involved in (earlier) increases in use. Al-
 though the present research shows that
 perceived risk and disapproval can act to limit
 use of a drug, it is obvious that other factors
 such as awareness and availability also place
 limits on use-and that changes in these latter
 factors very likely contributed to the initial
 increases in use of various illicit drugs.

 Finally, with respect to prevention, the
 present findings about cocaine reinforce our
 earlier conclusions based on the analysis of
 marijuana use. It appears that large propor-
 tions of young people do pay attention to new
 information about drugs, especially risks and
 consequences; such information, presented in
 a realistic and credible fashion, plays a vital
 part in reducing the demand for a drug. The
 evidence available thus far shows clearly that

 such reduction in demand has been the key
 to controlling the epidemics of marijuana use
 and cocaine use.

 cluded subjects for whom data were missing on
 one or more of the measures of annual cocaine
 use, annual marijuana use, personal disapproval
 of either drug, or perceived risks of either drug
 (including those who stated, "Can't say, drug
 unfamiliar" instead of rating perceived risks).
 Also excluded from the analyses were the small
 numbers of respondents whose answers to the
 series of items on perceived risks, or to the
 series on disapproval, were inconsistent or
 failed to provide meaningful distinctions among
 different drugs and different levels of use (see
 Bachman et al. 1988, footnote 1, for details).
 These several restrictions had the effect of
 excluding about 9 percent, on average, of the
 participants responding to Form 3, which
 contains the disapproval items. For Form 5,
 which contains the items on perceived risks, the
 restrictions excluded about 12 percent of the
 participants in 1985-1988 and somewhat larger
 proportions during earlier years (when more
 seniors claimed that they were not familiar
 enough with cocaine to rate its risks).

 2. As noted earlier, we first carried out regression

 analyses covering all 13 graduating classes.
 Although most of the findings were quite
 similar to those in Table 2, the critical
 difference is that including either attitude
 measure in the equation removed only a portion
 of the unique contribution of the secular trend
 measure.
