Research Question
In recent years, we have begun to observe the growth of the internet economy, which has
progressively led to "crowd-based" platforms and the direct matching of lenders and bor-
rowers. Via peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms the decision process of loan origination
is given into the hands of private lenders and borrowers. This paper investigates how
the P2P lending market fits into the credit market and specifically aims to answer the
following questions: Why do retail consumers look for P2P financial intermediation? Are
the interest rates charged by P2P lenders in Germany higher than those of banks? Are
P2P loans more risky than bank loans? Are internet-based peer-to-peer loans substitutes
for or complementary to bank loans?
Contribution and Results
The paper shows that loans channelled via P2P platforms involve higher interest rates
than loans channelled via the traditional banking sector. They are also riskier than those
of banks. However, when adjusted for risk, the interest rates are comparable. Moreover,
analysis of the different segments of the bank credit market and P2P lending shows that,
after having controlled for interest rate and risk differences, the bank lending volumes are
negatively correlated with the P2P lending volumes. Our finding suggests that high-risk
borrowers substitute bank loans for P2P loans since banks are unwilling or unable to
supply this slice of the market.

Abstract
Why do retail consumers look for P2P financial intermediation? Are internet-
based peer-to-peer (P2P) loans a substitute for or a complement to bank loans?
In this study we answer these questions by comparing P2P lending with the non-
construction consumer credit market in Germany. We show that P2P lending is
servicing a slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks, namely high-
risk and small-sized loans. Nevertheless, when accounting for the risk differential,
interest rates are very similar. Our conclusion is that P2P lending is substituting
the banking sector for high-risk consumer loans since banks are unwilling or unable
to supply this slice of the market. Our study serves to show where the institution-
alization of credit provision has left a slice of the market unsupplied.
Keywords: P2P lending, financial intermediation, consumer credit.

1 Introduction
Historically, banks are an institutional solution to the problem of asymmetric information
in the credit market between the provider of funds and the receiver of those funds; see
Akerlof (1970) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981). Both ex ante (adverse selection) and the ex
post (moral hazard) asymmetric information can be mitigated by banks because of their
expertise in screening and monitoring borrowers at reduced cost compared to individual
lenders, as stressed by Leland and Pyle (1977) and Diamond (1984). Therefore, in the
hypothetical case of perfect screening and monitoring, banks can extend financing to
many firms or individuals who would otherwise not be granted it. No borrower should be
rationed and each borrower should pay the right price to obtain the loan. In this case,
all "bankable" consumers would have access to credit and there would be no opening for
new business models to compete with the banking sector.
However, what we have begun to observe in recent years is the growth of the internet
economy, which has progressively led to "crowd-based" platforms which allow for the
direct matching of lenders and borrowers. Via the so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lending
platforms the decision process of loan origination is put into the hands of private lenders
and borrowers.
In this kind of lending model the mediation of financial institutions is not required, as
stressed by Herzenstein, Dholakia, and Andrews (2011) and Galloway (2009) and Morse
(2015). Borrowers (either households or firms) post their loan request online and provide
information on their current financial situation, e.g. income and open credit lines. On
the other hand, lenders look into a pool of credit seekers and search the ones that best
fit their risk-return preferences. The final decision in the screening process rests with the
lenders.
P2P lending is enjoying considerable success all over the world, and there is a clear
positive trend for the provision of credit via P2P platforms. By contrast, at the same
time, comparable segments of the credit market via the banking sector are showing a
negative trend.
This paper aims to investigate how the P2P lending market fits into the credit market
and specifically aims to answer the following questions. First, are the interest rates
charged by P2P lenders in Germany higher than those of banks? Second, are P2P loans
more risky than bank loans? Third, are risk-adjusted interest rates so different from those
of banks? Other studies have been conducted for the P2P lending market in the US, but
there are no papers which investigate this question in a developed country other than the
US. Moreover, the papers that investigate these issues in the US market have difficulties
comparing the interest rates charged by P2P versus banks since there are no official
statistics on interest rates on consumer loans. Furthermore, consumer lending in the US
is a very diffuse market, which includes non-banking loans as payday loans. In Germany,
by contrast, consumer loans are largely provided by banks, and the Bundesbank provides
good statistics at the bank level. Fourth, we aim to investigate whether the sensitivity of
the volume of loans to interest rates is similar to that of banks. By investigating this issue,
we are also contributing to the literature on banking since, to our knowledge, ours is the
first paper that investigates the P2P lending market from this perspective. Further, while
the transmission mechanism, i.e. how changes in market rates affect retail rates, have
been studied in the literature, much less is known about the elasticity of credit demand
1
with respect to loan rates, especially as they have been characterized in the recent years
by low interest rates, non-conventional monetary policies and bank capital requirement
constraints.
Finally, we investigate why retail consumers borrow on P2P platforms. The last
question induces us to investigate several reasons. (a) Does the credit demand, addressed
via P2P platforms, come from consumers with limited or no access to the banking sector?
(b) Does it come from consumers who want to borrow at better terms and conditions?
(c) Or does it come from customers who have a preference for the use of the internet and
are looking for other opportunities rather than classical bank products?
The interest in borrowing and lending via web-based platforms has been investigated
by looking at the Google Trends database provided by Google. By investigating (a),
(b) and (c), we are able to answer the question: Is P2P lending a substitute for or a
complement to bank lending?
This paper relates to the literature on P2P lending that is not vast but is growing
rapidly. In fact, although P2P lending is a relatively young sector which started in 2005
with the launch of Zopa, an increasing amount of research has been devoted to the topic,
especially after Prosper (a competitor of Zopa) made its entire platform's data available in
2007; see, Ravina (2012) and Pope and Sydnor (2011). The information technology nature
of P2P lending grants access to granular data on credit provision and the investigation of
new questions. On the one hand, scholars ask to what extent consumers' characteristics
impact their interest rate. Duarte, Siegel, and Young (2012) evaluates the impact of
trustful pictures on interest rates, Lin, Prabhala, and Viswanathan (2013) evaluate the
impact of friendship connections on interest rates, and Ravina (2012) evaluates the effect of
beauty and skin color on interest rates. On the other hand, researchers ask to what extent
information facilitation and institutional design enhance credit provision. Hildebrand,
Puri, and Rocholl (2015) investigate to what extent the change from interest rate auction
to rates that are pre-determined by the website affects the amount of credit provision.
Herzenstein et al. (2011) analyze to what extent investors herd with each other when
analyzing which loan to fund.
Our work abstracts from the behavioral aspects of the P2P credit market. Instead, we
offer a macro-perspective by analyzing how the P2P market outcome fits into the credit
market. In some ways our work is related to Blaseg and K¨
otter (2015), who analyze why
startups prefer equity crowdfinancing over bank credit, while our paper analyzes why
consumers seek credit on P2P platforms instead from banks.
The data on P2P lending are provided by Auxmoney, which is the largest and oldest
P2P lending platform in Germany for consumer credit. On the other hand, data on bank
lending are provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Because of differences origination
between P2P and bank lending in terms of their origination, we compare the two data
sets by controlling for risk and interest rate differences. In this way, we are able to set
the same basis for our econometric estimates. As a final note, we aim to stress that our
results and inferences are drawn from correlation and not from causation.
The paper shows that loans channeled via P2P platforms involve higher interest rates
than loans channelled via the traditional banking sector. They are also riskier than those
of banks. However, when adjusted for risk, the interest rates are comparable. Moreover,
analysis of the different segments of the bank credit market and P2P lending shows that,
after having controlled for interest rate and risk differences, the bank lending volumes are
2
negatively correlated with the P2P lending volumes. Our finding suggests that high-risk
borrowers substitute bank loans for P2P loans since banks are unwilling or unable to
supply this slice of the market.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data sets from Auxmoney and
the Deutsche Bundesbank. Section 3 compares the interest rates charged by Auxmoney
and those of German banks. Section 4 investigates the interest rate elasticity of Auxmoney
loans versus that of German banks. Section 6 expands our estimation in the context of
internet loans. Section 7 concludes.
2 Data and Descriptive Statistics
The data sources used in our study are (1) Auxmoney for data on P2P lending; (2) the
Deutsche Bundesbank (Interest Rates Statistics) for data on bank lending; (3) Schufa for
data on credit ratings; (4) the Deutsche Bundesbank (Balance Sheet Statistics) for data
on loan loss provisions; (5) the Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt) for
data on inflation, unemployment and GDP growth (interpolated quarterly), all by state;1
(6) Google Trends for data on Google search statistics.
Auxmoney is the oldest and largest P2P lending platform in Germany. According
to their website, from the day it begun business in 2007 until the time of writing (late
2015) the total volume of credit provided was EUR 219 million in 39,090 projects, with
an average nominal interest rate of 9.65%.
Auxmoney provided us with two different data sets. The first includes all loans pro-
vided by Auxmoney divided by cities between January 2010 and August 2014, with no
maturity information. The second includes the average amount of loan provision, the
average interest rate and the average Schufa score for each state per month.2 For reasons
of data confidentiality, Auxmoney provides records only with at least five loans' worth
observations. They also provide us with the statistics of the distribution of their loan
maturities provided in the first data set as reported in Table 1.

As Table 1 shows, the largest number of loans provided are the three-year loans, while
one-year maturity loans make up the smallest number. On average, the large-size loans

are the ones with the longer maturities. Loans range from EUR 11,487 for the five-year
maturity to 2,815 for the one-year maturity. In terms of total volume distribution, the
largest loan volumes are from the four- and five-year maturities.
The Deutsche Bundesbank statistics used in this study are provided by two differ-
ent data sets. The first is the Interest Rates Statistics (MIR, Bade and Beier (2016)),
which gives the amounts and the interest rates per bank and per month applied to non-
construction consumer credit lines (outstanding and new business) for different maturities
(credit card/ overdraft, up to one year, and more than one year). The statistics are com-
posed of monthly observations between January 2011 and August 2014. The second is the
data set from the Balance Sheet Statistics (BISTA, Beier, Krueger, and Schaefer (2016)),
which gives information on write­ups and write­downs, from which we derive the banks'
loan loss provisions.
As will become evident later in the study, our analysis is made on the state level. The
regional differentiation of bank loans is possible because of a feature of the German bank-
ing system: the presence of Sparkassen and Volksbanken. Sparkassen are geographically
restricted banks with a legal mandate to provide bank services to all potential costumers.3
Volksbanken are cooperative banks (also geographically restricted), whose costumers are
actually members of an organizational structure that aims at credit facilitation. By fo-
cusing on those banks that are more readily comparable to Auxmoney, we therefore avoid
the inclusion of large commercial banks or any non-regional banks. Thus, there are 105
banks in our sample, which hold loan portfolios of relatively small size.
Table 2 provides comparative descriptive statistics of the amount of P2P loans and
the average bank total of new loans per state with a distribution analysis of the banks
new loans by size for each of the different maturities (overdraft/cc, one-year loans, from
one- to five-year loans).

Table 2 shows that the average total volume of new loans granted by Auxmoney per
state per month is EUR 109,089, which is far lower than the average total loan volume
per month of the average total amount of new loans per bank per state, which is EUR
99,864,000.

Figure 1 shows and compares the amount of P2P loans with the amount of bank loans.
It shows that while bank lending either remains constant or follows a downward trend,
P2P lending follows a clear upward trend. On the other hand, P2P lending volume is
largely volatile, indicating that we have a far from established market.
Since we use data across different German states, we also verify whether the consumer
credit loans are proportionally distributed in each state. If credit provision had been
concentrated in one or only a few specific regions, our analysis would have been biased.
Figure 2 shows the geographical distribution of credit provision among German states
for both the banking sector and P2P lending. Each individual dark bar represents the
share of bank credit provided in a specific state in relation to the total amount of bank
credit provided in all states (in our sample of banks). Similarly, each single light-colored
bar represents the share of P2P credit provided in a specific state in relation to the total
amount of P2P credit provided in all states. Although the amount of credit is unevenly
distributed among states, Figure 2 shows that bank and P2P loans are proportionally
distributed among themselves and across states. To conclude, Figure 2 shows that for
some states (Brandenburg, Saarland and Thuringia) there is no information on Sparkassen
credit. Those three states are therefore excluded from our sample.

vice Center (RDSC) of the Deutsche Bundesbank and Auxmoney, sample period January
2011 to August 2014.
In our analysis we also investigate the interest in borrowing and lending via web-
based platforms. The Google hits on credit-specific keywords (namely, "Finanzierung"
(funding), "Kredit" (loan), "Auxmoney" and "Schufa") are collected and pooled together
for each German state for the period January 2011 to August 2014. Google Trends
provides a monthly or weekly time series of the volumes of Google hits for each selected
keyword. Therefore, in order to have comparable volumes at each point in time, we
aggregate the weekly time series to the month resolution. By default, for each time series,
Google Trends normalizes the volumes to their highest value, which is set equal to 100,
and all the other values are related to it with a precision of one. This normalization allows
for comparisons of time series within the same German state but not across them. The
results of our analysis are shown in Table 3. Note that the summary statistics are based
on 12 German states instead of 16. Brandenburg, Bremen, Saarland and Thuringia are
excluded because the volumes of the Google searches, although pooled at the state level,
are negligible and do not display enough variation.

3 Interest Rates and Loan Riskiness
In this paper we investigate first whether the interest rates charged for P2P lending are
higher than those charged by banks and, in particular, we investigate how different the
riskiness of P2P loans are.
Table 4 shows the interest rates applied to new loans by banks and P2P during the
period January 2011 to August 2014.

Bundesbank and Auxmoney, sample period January 2011 to August 2014.
The average interest rates across banks and states are 11.18%, 2.99% and 4.59% for
CC/OD, [0, 1]y loans and ]1, 5]y loans, respectively. During the same period, the average
interest rate applied for P2P loans is 12.75%.
7
As one would expect, on average, overdraft interest rates are higher than the other
interest rates. In particular, the spread between the average interest rate on CC/OD and
the average interest rate on [0, 1]y loans is due to (1) the cost of liquidity provision which
is provided "on demand" for CC/OD; (2) differences in the borrowers' risk profile. The
comparison between the interest rates charged by banks and by P2P lending indicates
that P2P lending is characterized by an interest rate that is higher than that charged
by banks. The products closely similar to P2P loans are the CC/OD. However, we need
to stress that P2P loans do not provide the same liquidity service provision as CC/OD,
therefore, there should be other reasons why P2P lending is at nominal interest rates that
are higher than the classical bank loans.
To investigate this issue, we look at the risk of the P2P loans versus that of bank
loans. In fact, the interest rate gap between bank and P2P lending can be potentially
explained by the existing different credit risk between bank and P2P borrowers. In order
to quantify this spread, we measure the default probabilities of the borrowers by using the
Schufa score data set for P2P borrowers and the loan loss provisions for bank borrowers.
The Schufa score goes from zero to 1,000, and the higher the value the safer it is.
From the Schufa scores we proxy the default probabilities by using the transformation
table provided by Korczak and Wilken (2010), see Table 11 in the Appendix. In this way
we were able to carry out a match between the Schufa scores and loan default probability.
Unfortunately, although banks also have access to the Schufa scores of their clients,
this information is kept confidential. Therefore, as a proxy for the default probabilities
we use the loan loss provisions () defined as write­up and write­down over outstanding
loans:
b,i
s,t
=
writeupdownb,i
s,t
outstandingb,i
s,t
, (1)
where i  {o, z, m}. Whenever banks expect a loan become non-performing (normally,
when it is 90 days past due), banks take the precaution of writing them down from their
balance sheet and creating a provision which is set aside as an allowance. Similarly, a loan
can be written up if it was expected to default but was paid in the end. In the BISTA of
the Deutsche Bundesbank, loans are written up/down in full regardless of their recovery
rate; see e.g., Memmel, G¨
und¨
uz, and Raupach (2015).
By using this formula we are able to extract the implicit default probabilities of bank
loans as well. The results are summarized in Table 5, which reports the credit risks of
bank and P2P loans in terms of the borrowers' default probabilities.

of CC/DD, [0, 1]y and ]1, 5]y loans, respectively. This indicates that bank borrowers are
very different from P2P borrowers. The former are largely less risky, indicating that banks
are strictly rationing credit to risky borrowers.
The last question we investigate in this section is whether, by adjusting the interest
rate by risk, we still observe a large difference in the interest rate charged by banks versus
P2P lending.
Although not directly comparable, as they are derived from different metrics, the
default probabilities in Table 5 are used to convert the interest rates in Table 4 into risk-
adjusted interest rates as shown in Table 6. The risk-adjusted interest rate is calculated
as:
1 + r = (1 - ) × (1 + i) +  × RR , (2)
where r is the risk-adjusted interest rate, i is the risky rate,  is the probability of default
that we proxy with the loan loss provision rate frequency and RR is the recovery rate.4
4RR is set equal to zero for P2P loans in order to match full write­down of banks in the balance sheet
statistics.

Table 6 shows that when P2P lending interest rates are adjusted by risk, they are
largely in line with those charged by banks for one- to five-year maturities, perfectly
in line with the maturities of the P2P loans. This result, even if it comes from several
approximations, indicates that P2P lenders apply interest rates that are largely in line with
those applied by banks, and that the large difference stems from the fact that borrowers'
characteristics are very different: the P2P platform lends to a group of borrowers that
are very much rationed by banks because of the high risk.
4 Loan Volume and Interest Rate Elasticity
One of the purposes of this paper is at look to the P2P lending market from a macro-
perspective. In this section we investigate, in a partial equilibrium framework, whether
the sensitivity of the volume of loans to interest rates is similar to that of banks. We
consider a reduced form model of consumer credit from P2P platforms that we then use
in the estimation analysis below.
The partial equilibrium reduced form model we consider is the one where P2P credit
provision KP2P depends only on interest rate and risk (for a formal derivation, see Freixas
and Rochet (2008)):
Kh = f ih, h, e , (3)
where Kh are the loan volume for Auxmoney, ih is the interest rate charged by the P2P
platform, h is the risk profile of P2P's borrowers, and e is the market interest rate that
represent the marginal cost of funding.
We investigate the relationship between loan volumes, interest rate, risk and marginal
cost of funding by estimating Equation (3) with a panel regression expressed as:
Log[Kh
s,t
] = 0
+ 1
ih
s,t
+ 2
h
s,t
+ 3
et
+ 4
 + us,t
+ s
(4)
where s denotes the state and t denotes the time. The dependent variable Log[Kh
s,t
] is
10
the log of the loan volume per state per month of Auxmoney when h corresponds to P2P
and banks when h is equal to b. The other main regressors are the nominal interest rate
charged and the default probability. The market interest rate that represents the funding
margin cost is proxied with the one-month Euribor rate.
Furthermore, the equation includes a constant, a vector of control variables, state
fixed effect and a random error term. We consider three control variables ­ inflation,
GDP growth and unemployment ­ all by state.
The estimated coefficients with fixed effect and standard errors clustered by state are
reported in Table 7.

for autocorrelation in panel data, where H0
is autocorrelation.
Table 7 reports in the first four columns the results of Auxmoney loans. Column I
considers no state control variables, and Column II includes instead state control variables
like CPI, GDP growth and unemployment. In both specifications we see that the elasticity
of volumes with respect to interest rates is negative and highly significant, indicating that
an increase of the interest rates reduces the volume. This means that the volume is
largely driven by the demand for loans: when interest rates are higher the demand for
loans is lower. The coefficient is similar for both specifications, indicating that it is not
largely driven by state economic conditions. We are also controlling for state fixed effect;
therefore, our results are not driven by omitted variables related to the state characteristics
like size or population.
11
The same analysis has been performed for banks. The results are reported in Columns
V and VI. In this case the elasticity is positive and significant but the coefficient is largely
lower than that for Auxmoney loans. This indicates that an increase in the interest rate
increases the volume of loans. We could interpret this evidence that the loan supply is
largely driving the bank market. On the other hand, we need to be very careful how
we read this elasticity coefficient, since the period we consider is largely characterized by
major monetary policy interventions to stimulate credit lending.
In Column III we report the estimation of the relationship between loan volume and
both the risk-adjusted interest rate and loan risk. The results indicate that loan volume
elasticity is driven by both these variables: an increase in the risk-free interest rate reduces
the volume, but also loans that are more risky have lower volumes. This is perfectly in
line with an equilibrium in which the adjusted interest rate responds to demand for loans;
if the rate is too high, demand is lower. Instead, the risk indicates that when loans are
too risky, the supply of loans declines in line with credit rationing.
By contrast, the results for banks are difficult to interpret. They are reported in
Column VII. In this case the risk-adjusted interest rate is having a positive impact on
loan volumes, but the coefficient is very low. Instead, risk is the main driver of the results
and the coefficient is also positive and significant at the 5% level. Again, this indicates
that loan volumes are largely driven by the supply side; and if we consider that the risk of
bank loan is very low compared to Auxmoney loans, it is reasonable to argue that bank
supply is driving equilibrium in the bank loan market.
Finally, we investigate the role of the pass-through interest rate effect generated by
the changes in the ECB's policy interest rate. We consider the Euribor interest rate as
the bank's marginal rate and investigate whether volumes are largely related to external
factors, like the bank cost of funding, captured with the Euribor rate.
Column IV reports the results for Auxmoney and Column VIII for banks. The analysis
shows that the marginal market interest rate plays a significant role for both Auxmoney
loans and banks' loan volumes. In the first case, the reduction in the Euribor increases the
volume, while for banks a reduction in the Euribor is related to a reduction of the volume
of loans. Again, it is hard to identify whether this effect is supply- or demand-driven. In
both cases the coefficient is larger than the spread rate charged by Auxmoney and banks
(i-e); therefore, it is clear that market conditions strongly affect the issuance of new loans.
In all regression specifications we added an AR(1) process to avoid possible autocor-
relation problems. Also, we run autocorrelation test as proposed by Wooldridge (2002,
2008) in all regressions. We find no evidence for autocorrelation at the 5% confidence
interval.
The analysis we have performed so far is partial because it does not consider the
impact of the loan volume of the banking sector on the loan volume of Auxmoney. To
investigate this, we should include in our analysis the credit supply by the banking sector
and Auxmoney.

5 Impact of the Credit Channel on P2P Loans
In this section we investigate the role of the competition in the volume of loans provided
by both Auxmoney and the banks. Therefore, we extend Eq. (3) as follows:
KP2P = f iP2P , P2P , DP2P ; Kb, ib, b , (5)
where Kb is the volume of credit provided by the banking sector, ib is the interest rate
applied by the banking sector, and b is the risk profile of banks' borrowers.

variable: log of credit provision by Auxmoney. (***) represents significance at the 1%
level, (**) at the 5% level, and (*) at the 10% level, standard errors in (), clustered by state.
Model I has no state fixed effects, model II takes them into account. State controls include
CPI, rent price index, GDP and employment. All explanatory variables are lagged. Risk
measured in default probability (%). Autocorrelation gives the p-value for Wooldridge
(2002, 2008) test for autocorrelation in panel data, where H0
is autocorrelation.
The first two columns of Table 8 show that P2P loan volumes are still largely related
to the interest rate charged by Auxmoney, but they are also related to the difference to
the interest rate charged by banks in that state. The larger the difference, the larger the
volume. This indicates that the more different they are from the clients of the bank in
13
terms of riskiness (that is implicit in the interest rate, as we showed above) the larger is
the volume of Auxmoney. On the other hand, if we look at the volume of loans already
provided by banks, we find that Auxmoney is lending more where banks are lending less
(after controlling for interest rates and riskiness). This is in line with what we have already
observed cross-sectionally among states from Figure 1. This result indicates that P2P
lending is servicing a slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks characterized
by high risk and small size. It is important to stress that Auxmoney is providing this
service without extracting a significant return since the risk-adjusted interest rate is in
line with that charged by banks. Nevertheless, Auxmoney does not have the cost of the
branches that the banks have to face; therefore, it is implicitly earning the profit that
derives from having lower fixed costs. Nevertheless, this indicates that there is no evidence
of "predatory lending" in the P2P loan market in Germany.
Columns III and IV of Table 8 report the same analysis for banks. In this case, we still
see that the elasticity of the loan volume to interest rate is not affected by the introduction
of the new variables. The spread between the interest rate charged by banks and that
of Auxmoney is not relevant. Instead, the results confirm that the loan volumes of P2P
are larger where bank loan volumes are relatively lower. This again indicates that P2P
responds (very partially and for a limited amount) to the credit provision left unsupplied
by banks.
The last analysis we perform in the next section concerns the general interest of bor-
rowers and lenders in new forms of internet-driven direct credit supply.
6 P2P Loans and the Digital Economy
In this section we investigate the role of the "novelty" factor and interest in new forms of
lending and borrowing shown by investors and borrowers. We extend Eq. (3) as follows:
KP2P = f iP2P , P2P , Kb, ib, b, DP2P ; , (6)
where DP2P is an "innovation factor" variable that aims at capturing the general interest
of borrowers in new forms of internet-driven direct credit supply. Historically, in off-line
markets, borrowers used to collect funds indirectly from lenders via brick and mortar
banks.
Currently, in the internet age, alternative solutions like P2P lending platforms leverage
advanced technology and data analytics to directly match borrowers and lenders only via
the internet; see e.g., Berger and Gleisner (2009). Thus, ceteris paribus, DP2P captures
the propensity towards web-based P2P credit solutions.
In order to capture this type of demand, we measure the frequency with which credit-
specific keywords ("Finanzierung" (funding), "Kredit" (loan), "Auxmoney") are googled
by the general public. For this purpose we use Google Trends, a web facility based on
Google Search that shows how often a particular search term is entered in the search
engine relative to the total search volume across various regions of the world, and in
various languages.
The choice of the keywords is based on two criteria. First, the keywords should
intuitively be related to the online consumer credit market. Second, the correlation among
14
the keywords' queries should be small. Statistics on the terms googled are reported in
Table 3.
Table 3 shows that there is a significant variability among states and through time of
the "hit" of the different words we have considered. This means that the interest is not
the same on this regards.
We also investigate the correlation among the "hits" of these variables. Table 9
presents the correlation among the Google variables.
Finanzierung Kredit Auxmoney
Finanzierung 1
Kredit 0.306 1
Auxmoney 0.26 0.258 1
Table 9: Correlation Google Trend variables.
Table 9 shows that the correlation among the four keywords is indeed very low. This
means that we were able to include these variables in our analysis. It is very difficult
to indicate whether the hits for these words are highly related to investors or borrowers.
However, we could expect that the word "Finanzierung" (funding) refers more to investors
and "Kredit" (loan), to borrowers' interest. The word "Auxmoney", on the other hand,
could be referred to the interest of both investors and borrowers.
Table 10 indicates that the results regarding loan elasticity to interest rates and the
substituting relationship between banks and Auxmoney loans are confirmed.
The Google trend variables we considered are only significant for loan volumes of
Auxmoney and not for lending banks. This is in line with what we may expect: the
majority of bank clients are not interested in finding bank loan opportunities on the
internet (at least, so far). Instead, these variables are significant for Auxmoney loan
volume. We find that the number of hits of the variable "Finanzierung" is significant and
positively related to Auxmoney credit provision, which means that the interest for finding
financing opportunities is related to larger volumes of Auxmoney loans. Instead the large
amount of interest associated with the hits for "Kredit" are related to a smaller amount of
loans. This result could be explained by the fact that when the number of people looking
for credit grows larger, adverse selection problems arise.
The hits for "Auxmoney", on the other hand, do not lead to a larger volume of loans,
indicating that there is no connection between the interest in these platforms and the
actual providers of credit. However, we are aware that these are just proxy variables that
capture several dimensions of the behaviors of investors and creditors.

7 Conclusion
This paper studies the impact of a new competitor in the credit market. By empirically
investigating several questions, we shed light on a new credit channel that financial inno-
vations and technologies have allowed to rise. In the paper we highlight that Auxmoney,
the largest P2P loan provider in Germany, is charging interest rates that are higher than
those of banks, but that the borrowers are largely more risky that the banks' borrowers.
16
However, if we control for risk, the risk-adjusted interest rate is in line with the interest
rate charged by banks for one- to five-year loans. Moreover, if we look at the distributions
of loans of Auxmoney and their dynamics, we find that Auxmoney is lending relatively
more where and when banks are lending less. Combining these two elements ­ riskiness
and geographical distribution ­ we could conclude that Auxmoney is serving borrowers
largely considered not "bankable" by banks, that is a segment of borrowers that banks
are unwilling (or unable because of bank capital requirements, for example) to supply.
Information technology allowed a previously neglected segment of the consumer credit
market to be served by market newcomers. This slice of the market is characterized by
high-risk consumers and small credit lines.
The immediate question raised is why banks are not serving these costumers. If credit
were like any other good, one would expect that if prices increase in line with risk there
should still be actors willing to provide it. However, the institutionalization of credit
provision for small loans may have adverse effects, as this paper describes. Even banks
with a clear legal mandate to accept all customers (and therefore the lower cost of accessing
a broad spectrum of retail costumers) are not willing to provide credit to this slice of the
market.
There are several reasons for that behavior. First, banks with a high default rate may
incur reputation costs, which might impact negatively on other more profitable business
areas. Second, high default rates force banks to increase their loss provisions and, with
that, higher capital requirements. Third, the marginal costs of an extra loan provided
by banks with brick and mortar branches are certainly higher when compared with the
provision of loans through the internet. Thus, banks might be refusing to provide loans for
which banks' profit is smaller than their costs, whereas these loans may still be profitable
for P2P financial intermediation. Fourth, banks' lending procedures are very complex and
paper intensive. P2P lending is faster and easy.
However, each of these reasons indicates that so far, regular financial institutions are
still leaving part of the demand for credit unsupplied.
