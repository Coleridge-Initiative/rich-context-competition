Using data collected from the first wave of a longitudinal data set collected in the late fall and
winter of 1990-1991, the National Survey of Self-Care and Aging (NSSCA), we examined the
extent and type of assistance older people provided to others. Age, gender, and perceived
health status were the most consistent predictors of the four types of assistance: personal care,
child care, volunteer work, and listening/offering advice and support. Help with instrumental
activities of daily living either alone or in combination with other activities of daily living was
the most common type of personal care provided.

The American population is growing older, with
the most rapid growth occurring in the age group 85
years and older (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).
Often, along with the notion of an aging population,
the assumption is that those 65 years and older are
"dependent" and must be taken care of by those in
younger age cohorts. This assumption is supported
by the calculation of an "elderly dependency ratio,"
defined as the number of persons aged 65 and over
divided by the number of persons of working age
(i.e., 18 to 64 years). The fact that this elderly depen-

dency ratio has increased from .07 in 1900 to .18 in
1975, and is projected to be .29 in 2030, is used to
indicate that elderly people are becoming an increas-
ing social and economic burden on society (Cnaan &
Cwikel, 1992; Wisensale, 1991). A more positive per-
spective, however, is that many older people are
active, are employed well into their eighth decade of
life, and can and do make substantial contributions
to society. One of the ways they are able to make
such contributions is by providing help to others.
Why do older adults help others? One explanation
is an egoistic one that suggests that helping is moti-
vated by anticipation of rewards for helping, such as
social approval, and censure for not helping. For
example, a daughter may give up a part-time job to
care for her mother to avoid criticism from family and
friends or to see herself as being a good person
(Schulz, 1990). A different perspective is provided by
the theory that helping is based on altruistic motiva-
tion. The goal is helping the other person and not the
self, although benefits to oneself may be a conse-
quence of helping. Thus, the caregiver is able to
empathize with the care recipient and evoke a moti-
vation aimed at reducing the other's needs (Schulz,
1990). Sociological explanations for why people help
others often include social norms such as reciproc-
ity, equity, or social responsibility. Thus, helping
others is a way of paying back what others have given
to us or helping others is a duty that should not be
shirked (Schulz, 1990). Proponents of activity theory
suggest that maintenance of activity in old age com-
pensates for role-loss and promotes morale and thus
should be encouraged. Therefore, providing assis-
tance not only benefits the recipients, but also pro-

motes the well-being of the providers (Cnaan &
Cwikel,1992).
What research has been done to document the
scope of assistance and characteristics of the pro-
viders? Substantial research has focused on: (1) the
characteristics of the older adult as the recipient of
assistance (e.g., Coward, Home, & Dwyer, 1992;
Select Committee on Aging, 1987), (2) the reciprocal
assistance provided between parents and children
(e.g., Eggebeen, 1992; Speare & Avery, 1993; Spitze
& Logan, 1992) or siblings (e.g., Avioli, 1989; Cicirelli,
1992; Suggs, 1989), and (3) the types of volunteer
work provided by older adults (e.g., Marriott Senior
Volunteerism Study, 1991; Perry, 1983). However,
relatively few studies have asked representative sam-
ples of older people about the range of assistance
provided to others (Patterson, 1987). In most of the
studies cited, either the attention has been limited to
those benefiting from (rather than providing) the
care, or the scope of inquiry has been limited to
family exchanges or to types of volunteer work pro-
vided, rather than to broadening the range of study
to include other types of assistance provided (such as
personal care for other adults or child care). Only
three studies of which we are aware provided a more
comprehensive picture of older people as recipients
and givers of care (Herzog, Kahn, Morgan, Jackson,
& Antonucci, 1989; Shenk, 1991; U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1990). This article contributes to the geron-
tological literature by using data collected from a
nationally representative sample of community-
dwelling older adults to examine the extent and type
of assistance older people provide to others and the
characteristics of both the providers and the recipi-
ents of that assistance.
Previous Studies
The term informal caregiver (as compared with
formal caregiver) has been defined somewhat differ-
ently by researchers working in this area, but usually
refers to care or services offered by a relative, friend,
or neighbor who is a member of "a diffuse primary
group characterized by its small size, affectivity, and
durable commitment to each other's well-being"
(DeFriese & Woomert, 1992, p. 63). Schulz (1990)
reviews two approaches that are used to obtain sam-
ples in caregiving research. The "direct" approach
recruits caregivers directly during support group
meetings of Alzheimer's, stroke, or cancer patients,
while the "indirect" approach first locates older peo-
ple with disabilities and asks them to identify, their
primary (and sometimes secondary) caregivers.
An example of the "direct" approach was the study
conducted by Fortinsky and Hathaway (1990) where
caregivers were recruited through the 20 Alzheimer's
disease support groups in Maine. It was found that
the active caregivers were overwhelmingly female
(75.4%) and about one-third (34.5%) were 65 and
older. An example of the "indirect" approach was
the work of Coward, Home, and Dwyer (1992), who
used data from the 1982 National Long-Term Care
Survey (NLTCS) to identify elderly persons with im-
pairments living in community settings. Using these
data, they were able to describe the relationship be-
tween the caregiver and elderly recipient, the latter
being the focus of their research. These authors
found that wives and daughters were most fre-
quently mentioned as caregivers and that older
women were more apt than men to be receiving help
from both adult children and formal service pro-
viders. The focus in both these approaches, how-
ever, was on the elderly recipient of care and only
indirectly did we find out what proportion of care-
givers were elderly.
Some studies focus on reciprocal assistance pro-
vided between parents and children (intergenera-
tional) or between siblings. For example, a study by
Spitze and Logan (1992) focused on the frequency of
several types of help between parents and adult
children and the manner in which helping relation-
ships evolved throughout the life course. They found
that most kinds of household help were given more
frequently by elderly parents to children than by
children to their parents. Cicirelli (1992) summarized
research related to siblings as caregivers in middle
and older age. He concluded that sisters provided
more help to siblings than brothers; in the adult
child sibling network, sisters shared the caregiving
burden more equally than brothers, and sisters and
brothers tended to fulfill caregiving tasks depending
upon how the tasks fit traditional conceptions of
male and female roles.
Older adults may provide help to others by.serving
as volunteers. Volunteering has been defined by
Smith and Freedman (1972, p. 115) as "any unpaid
work performed for or through an organization,"
while others have used a somewhat broader defini-
tion to include working for others without monetary
compensation (Independent Sector, 1990). Chambr6
(1993) reviewed surveys from 1965 to 1990 that fo-
cused on older adult volunteers. Her review sug-
gested that the percentage of older adults who vol-
unteer has been increasing over time. In 1965, about
11% of those 65 and older had volunteered in the
past year, but by the early 1990s, this percentage had
increased to about 40%. However, these surveys
varied widely in their definition of what is meant by
being a volunteer. Older volunteers are more likely
to be women, have a higher level of education and
income, be in better health and have previous expe-
rience as a volunteer compared with nonvolunteers
(Marriott Senior Volunteerism Study, 1991; Perry,
1983). In addition, the proportion of older adults who
volunteer declines with age, especially over age 80
(Chambr6, 1993). These studies tended to focus on
broadly defined volunteer activities and did not ask
about other types of help the older adults provided.
One study provided data to give a more compre-
hensive picture of assistance given to others by older
people. The sixth interview of the 1985 panel of the
Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)
asked questions both about help received and help
provided to others (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1990).
This study included respondents 15 years of age and
older from a representative national sample of
households. Respondents were asked if they helped
Vol.36, No. 4,1996 475
another person with personal care, getting around
outside, preparing meals, doing housework, or
keeping track of bills and/or money and their rela-
tionship to that person. Only 14.9% of the sample
was 65 years of age or older. Of those 65 years and
older, 5.5% provided a household member and 7.9%
provided a nonhousehold member with help with
one or more activity. In another study, Herzog and
her colleagues (1989) used data from the 1986 survey
entitled Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) to study
these issues. This was a nationally representative
sample of 3,617 respondents 25 years of age and
older who were asked about "productive activity,"
which was defined as those "activities that earn or
save money or that help others in ways for which a
market value can plausibly be imputed" (p. S130).
They found that older Americans participated in a
number of unpaid activities and noted the disadvan-
tages of only including paid work in describing pro-
ductive activity in their analysis. Findings from a
multiphase qualitative study of 30 older women in
central Minnesota (Shenk, 1991) provided evidence
that older adults seek and provide assistance to and
from a broad range of individuals. The decisions
about seeking and providing assistance were "based
on a range of variables including convenience, per-
sonal relationships and availability. Arrangements
that maximized their personal independence and
control are strongly preferred" (p. 351).
A different approach is taken in the study reported
here by directly asking a representative national sam-
ple of older adults about help (of various types) they
provide to others. Data are presented from the first
wave of a longitudinal database on older adults, the
National Survey of Self-Care and Aging (NSSCA), an
in-person interview study of self-care practices
among community-dwelling adults aged 65 and
older. As part of this study, subjects were asked
whether, and for whom, they provide a variety of
types of assistance. As a result, the data set provides
national estimates of the proportion and characteris-
tics of older people who provide different types of
assistance to others and the characteristics of both
providers and recipients of these services.
In this article, the following questions are ad-
dressed: (1) What proportion of older people pro-
vide assistance to others? (2) What are the character-
istics of older people who provide assistance to
others? (3) Of those who provide personal assistance
to others, what types of assistance do they provide?
(4) To whom do older people provide personal assis-
tance? (5) What is the association between the type of
personal assistance provided and the characteristics
of those who receive the assistance? (6) Which char-
acteristics of older people are the best predictors of
service to others?
Methods
Sample
The target population for the National Survey of
Self-Care and Aging consisted of all community-
dwelling Medicare beneficiaries in the contiguous
United States who were 65 years of age or older in
1990. The final design was a stratified, multistage
sample with geographic stratification in the first
stage, based on the distribution of Medicare benefi-
ciaries 65 years of age or older. In all but the final
stage of sampling, probability proportional to mea-
sures of target population size (PPS) selection meth-
ods were used. First, 50 primary sampling units, 38
urban and 12 rural, were randomly chosen. Standard
Metropolitan Areas (SMAs) and counties served as
primary sampling units (PSUs) in urban and rural
areas, respectively. Within each urban PSU, three zip
codes were selected in the second sampling stage.
Eligible subjects who resided within these urban zip
codes were then selected in the third stage. In rural
counties the study sample was chosen from a list of
all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older in the
county.
This sample is characterized by several unique
features: (1) It is representative of the total noninsti-
tutionalized elderly population of Medicare benefi-
ciaries in the contiguous United States; (2) it has
been stratified by gender and age (males and females
65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, and 85 years and older)
in the final stage of selection, with oversampling of
the oldest-old to facilitate subgroup analysis; and (3)
it was selected proportional to the urban/rural distri-
bution of the elderly population.
Baseline in-person interviews, lasting approxi-
mately one hour, were conducted with 3,485 respon-
dents in the late fall and winter of 1990-1991. Ninety
percent were conducted with the subject, while the
remainder (10%) were conducted with proxies. Re-
sponse rates, ranging from 66 to 71%, varied by age-
sex categories and geographic location, with slightly
higher response rates in the youngest age groups
and among persons in rural communities. (For addi-
tional information about the study design, see Nor-
burnetal.,1995.)
The analysis presented here uses estimation
weights that account for the unequal probabilities of
selection introduced by design considerations, po-
tential biases introduced by differential coverage in
the sampling frame, and sample imbalance due to
varying response rates among important population
subgroups (e.g., by age; Lessler & Kalsbeek, 1992).
An initial set of weights was produced to reflect the
probability of selection for each survey respondent.
These weights were then post-stratified to match the
age-race-sex distribution of the noninstitutionalized
component of the Medicare Current Beneficiary
Survey. Using the adjusted estimation weights en-
ables the construction of valid national population
estimates.
Measures
Dependent Variables. -- (A) Assistance to Others.
All subjects were asked about three types of assis-
tance that may have been provided to others. The
question was asked, "During the last 12 months, did
you periodically ...?" followed by the list of activi-
476 The Gerontologist
ties: provide child care, do volunteer work, or listen
to others/offer advice and support. Individuals an-
swered "yes" or "no" to each of these three types of
activities. An additional open-ended question asked
about any other assistance they may have given to
others during the 12 months preceding the interview.
(B) Personal Care. An initial question was asked to
determine if subjects had helped anyone with any
day-to-day activities during the last 12 months. If the
subject answered "yes," he or she was then asked,
"During the last 12 months, did you ever help an-
other person ... ?" followed by a list of 15 activities.
These activities were categorized into three dimen-
sions: providing help with Basic Activities of Daily
Living (BADL; i.e., helping someone to eat, bathe, or
dress), help with Mobility Activities of Daily Living
(MADL; i.e., helping someone to transfer, get out-
side, walk or get to the toilet), and/or help with
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL; i.e.,
helping someone to prepare meals, do heavy or light
housework, do yard work, prepare meals, take meals
to someone, use the telephone, manage money, or
shop for personal items). Individuals answered "yes"
or "no" to each of the 15 specific activities. For each
of these three ADL dimensions, a score was obtained
by summing the number of activities with which the
subject provided assistance. These scores were then
collapsed into three dichotomous variables indica-
ting whether the individual provided (or did not
provide) assistance to another person with any of the
types of activities within each functional domain. In
addition, for some of the analysis, an overall score
for personal care was created to indicate whether or
not the subject provided assistance with any of the 15
activities. If the subject helped another individual
with any item, the following was asked, "Who did
you help?" These responses were categorized by
relationship to the care provider (i.e., whether the
person helped was a spouse, another relative, or a
close friend or neighbor).
Independent Variables. -- The following subject
characteristics are included in the analysis: age, gen-
der, race, marital status, education, family/individual
income as a percent of federal poverty guidelines,
household composition (living alone), geographic
residence (rural-urban), and self-perceived health.
Age is divided into three categories: 65-74 years, 75-
84 years, and 85 and older. Race is divided into
African American and white/other. Asians and His-
panics are included in the "other" group and com-
bined with the "white" category because they consti-
tuted too small a group for analysis. Household
composition is defined as living alone versus living
with at least one other person. Education was deter-
mined by asking subjects what was the last grade of
school they had completed. For this analysis, level of
education was collapsed into four groups: primary
grades (0 to 8 years of education), some high school
(9 to 11 years), high school or trade school (high
school or equivalent, business or trade school with-
out finishing high school, or post high school busi-
ness or trade school), and some college or more (at
least one year of college). Current marital status was
defined as never married, currently married, wid-
owed, separated or divorced. Place of residence was
collapsed into two groups: urban (MSA census defi-
nition) and rural (non-MSA census definition). Per-
ceived health status was determined by the response
to the following question: "How would you rate your
health at the present time? Would you say it is . . .
(excellent, very good, good, fair, poor)?"
Household income was coded in 12 ordered cate-
gories. The family or household income variable was
divided by the number of people supported by that
income. Using the 1989 Bureau of the Census thresh-
old for 100% of poverty level, the sample was catego-
rized into five groups: below 100% of poverty, 100 to
149% of poverty, 150 to 199% of poverty, 200 to 399%
of poverty, and 400% or more of poverty. (For addi-
tional information about imputation of missing val-
ues for income data, see Norburn et al., 1995.)
Analysis
Descriptive and multivariate analyses were per-
formed on the NSSCA data set in order to address the
five research questions posed earlier. Weighted fre-
quency distributions and weighted cross-tabulations
were calculated using SUDAAN software (Research
Triangle Institute, 1989) to: (1) assess the types of
assistance provided, and (2) categorize the different
providers and recipients of each type of assistance.
SUDAAN properly incorporates all relevant features
of the complex sampling design used in this study
(i.e., PSU stratification, cluster sampling, and vari-
able weights). Weighted multivariate logistic regres-
sion procedures were performed to identify impor-
tant predictors of the likelihood of: (a) providing
personal care, (b) providing child care, (c) perform-
ing volunteer services, and (d) listening or offering
advice and support. In each multivariate model esti-
mation, the dependent variable was coded with a
value of one, indicating that some assistance was
provided. A significance level of p < .05 was used in
all multivariate model estimations.
Results
Table 1 shows both the total number of older
adults who provide assistance and their sociodemo-
graphic characteristics. Approximately one-third of
community-dwelling elderly persons in the United
States (about 8.5 million) provide assistance with
personal care, almost one-fifth provide child care
(15.7% or 4.4 million), or perform volunteer work
(19.7% or 5.5 million), while 40% (11 million) listen to
others/offer advice and support. An additional 13.6%
answered affirmatively when asked an opened-
ended question about any other type of assistance
they provide. Other categories of assistance (not
shown in table) provided include financial help to
family and friends, transportation to doctor's ap-
pointments and church, household and car repairs,
writing letters, visits to sick friends and family, and
feeding neighbor's pets.

*This represents the percentage of each subgroup that provides assistance. For example, 35.1 % of those 65-74 years, 29.3% of those 75-
84 years, and 11.9% of those 85 and older provide personal care.
Based on 1990 population estimates of approximately 27 million Americans over the age of 65 living in noninstitutional settings,
excluding Hawaii and Alaska; totals within categories vary slightly because of missing values.
In all cases, the percentage of older adults who
provide assistance declines sharply across the age
groupings (and particularly after age 85). This rela-
tionship is most pronounced for assistance with per-
sonal care and child care and is least pronounced for
listening/offering advice and support. A smaller per-
centage of African Americans do volunteer work
compared to whites/others, and smaller proportions
of those who are divorced, separated or never mar-
ried provide child care and perform volunteer work
compared to those who are married or widowed. The
estimates for marital status are based on low preva-
lence and must be viewed with some caution be-
cause of the size of the standard error in relation to
the estimate. A smaller percentage of older adults
with lower education and lower income do volunteer
work. Even so, providing assistance is not an activity
reported only by those in excellent health. Except for
the percent performing volunteer work, which is
lower for older adults with good, fair or poor self-
ratings of health, the percentage of older adults
providing help declines only slightly until self-rated
health for the provider is reported as poor. Overall,
and for each category of assistance, there is a high
478 The Gerontologist
degree of similarity in the background characteristics
of individuals providing help. (As an example, nearly
equal proportions of men and women provide assis-
tance with personal care, child care, do volunteer
work or listen and offer advice.)
Table 2 focuses on the subgroup of respondents
who provide personal care to others, by type of
assistance provided. The overwhelming majority re-
port that they provide help with lADLs or lADLs in
combination with some other type of personal care.
Providing assistance with lADLs only, or in combina-
tion with BADLs and/or MADLs accounts for 96.7% of
assistance provided with personal care.
Table 3 shows that nearly the same percentages of
spouses, other relatives, and close friends/neighbors
are the recipients of assistance with personal care.
The assistance given by older adults seems to be
directed toward only one individual (i.e., spouse
only, other relative only, or close friend or relative
only) rather than a variety of individuals.
Table 4 describes the relationship between the
type of personal assistance provided and the recipi-
ent of that assistance. As noted in Table 2, small
numbers of respondents assist with basic ADLs only,
mobility ADLs only, or a combination of basic ADLs
and mobility ADLs. When assistance is provided with
basic ADLs or mobility ADLs only, it is most likely
given to assist a close friend or neighbor. Some of
these estimates are based on behaviors of low preva-
lence and must be viewed with caution because of
the size of the standard errors in relation to the
estimates. Most striking is the fact that across all
recipients, the most common type of personal assis-
tance provided is for instrumental ADLs (alone, or in
combination with other activities). In addition, when
only instrumental ADL assistance is provided, it is
usually given to only one person. In contrast, when
instrumental ADL assistance is provided in combina-
tion with other ADLs, there is a much broader range
of recipients receiving such care.

analysis to identify important predictors of the likeli-

hood of: (a) providing personal care, (b) providing
child care, (c) performing volunteer services, and (d)
listening and offering advice and support.
Providing Personal Care. -- The odds of providing
personal care declines with age and is lower for men
than women. Respondents who are married are one
and one-half times more likely to provide personal
care than those who are never married. This is not
surprising because many married couples help one
another. Higher education (some college or more)
appears to increase the odds of providing personal
care, although these findings are statistically signifi-
cant for only two of the three education groups. Two
categories of family income (100-149% of poverty
and 150-199% of poverty) as well as living alone are
associated with a decrease, albeit slight, in the odds
of providing personal care. The most striking finding
is the association between self-perceived health and
the likelihood of providing personal care. Using
poor perception of health as a referent category,
even fair ratings of health are associated with nearly
2.5 times the odds of providing personal care. On the
other hand, race and place of residence do not alter
the odds of providing personal care.
Providing Child Care. -- Older age, being male,
and living in rural areas are associated with a decrease
in the odds of providing child care, while being mar-
ried at some point during one's lifetime is associated
with an increase in the odds of providing child care.
This latter finding was anticipated because these re-
spondents are more likely to have grandchildren.
Geographic mobility of the children of rural elderly
persons that may result in greater distances from
grandchildren may be a partial explanation for the
decreased odds of rural elderly persons providing
child care. Both education and living alone are associ-
480 The Gerontologist
ated with a decrease in the odds of providing child
care. Self-perceived health is significantly related to
providing child care, although not with the same
magnitude as for the provision of personal care;
those in good or fair (as opposed to poor) health are
about one and one-half times more likely to provide
child care. In general, family income and race do not
alter the odds of providing child care.
Performing Volunteer Services. -- Being very old
(85 and older) is associated with a reduction in the
odds of performing volunteer work. Although the
odds ratios for gender, race, place of residence, and
living arrangements are all significant, they are close
to 1. Similarly, although the odds ratios for education
and income are both significant, the magnitude of
the effect of education is considerably larger than the
impact of income on the likelihood of performing
volunteer work. Perceived health has a substantial
impact on the odds of performing volunteer work;
those in excellent or very good health (as opposed to
poor health) are over eight times more likely to
provide volunteer services.
Listening and Offering Advice. -- Advancing age
and being male decrease the odds of listening and
offering advice to others as a form of assistance,
while being white or other race, having higher edu-
cation, and reporting better perceived health in-
crease these odds. The odds ratios for being di-
vorced (as opposed to never being married), living in
a rural area, and living alone also are statistically
significant, but they are close to one. Living alone is
not associated with the odds of listening and offering
advice and support.
Discussion
This article addressed six questions concerning the
proportion and characteristics of older people who
provided different types of assistance to others and
the characteristics of both the providers and recipi-
ents of these services. In this section, these ques-
tions will be revisited in light of the results.
(1) What proportion of older people provide assis-
tance to others? It is evident from the data presented
in this article that impressive numbers of older peo-
ple in the United States provide assistance in a variety
of different areas, thereby contributing significantly
to the vitality of their social networks and their com-
munity integration. Although a smaller percentage of
older adults report that they volunteer their time and
effort in assistance to others compared to that re-
ported in prior studies (Chambre\ 1993), this may be
in part an artifact of the data from the present study.
Most other studies of volunteer behavior focused
only on volunteer activities and did not ask about the
provision of other types of assistance. In this study,
however, respondents were asked about help pro-
vided both with different types of personal care (in-
cluding such things as help with yard work, bringing
meals to another person and shopping), and child
care, prior to being asked about the extent of their
volunteer commitments. As a result, some of the
activities that were classified as volunteer work in
other studies may have been classified as other cate-
gories of assistance (e.g., personal care, child care,
or listening/offering advice) in the current study.
(2) What are the characteristics of older people
who provide assistance to others and which of these
characteristics are the best predictors of service to
others? In the descriptive analysis, surprisingly similar
proportions of men versus women, rural versus
urban-dwellers, and older adults living solo versus
multiple-occupant dwellings provided assistance to
others. After controlling relevant variables in the mul-
tivariate analysis, however, the most consistent pre-
dictors across the four categories of assistance were
age, gender, and self-reported health status. Educa-
tion also was a positive predictor of the likelihood of
performing volunteer work and listening or giving
advice, while income was a positive predictor of the
likelihood of performing volunteer work. These pre-
dictors are similar in magnitude and direction to
those found in other studies (Chambr6, 1993; Mar-
riott Senior Volunteerism Study, 1991; Perry, 1983).
In general, those who provide assistance are most
likely to be female and in the younger age groups,
and in addition, those who volunteer are more likely
to have higher education. In future cohorts, how-
ever, women will be more likely to be in the work
force and overall educational attainment will in-
crease. Also, Social Security and other pension pro-
grams are facing greater financial risk, resulting in
the necessity for many older people to remain em-
ployed to an older age (Cnaan & Cvvikel, 1992).
Therefore, as the age of retirement and amount of
education increase, it will be important to monitor
the possible impact of these factors on the willing-
ness of future generations of older adults to provide
assistance to others. It is also noteworthy that assis-
tance to others is not an activity restricted to those
who perceive their health to be extremely good. On
the contrary, for a large proportion of older adults,
providing assistance does not decline substantially
until the older person perceives his or her health to
be poor. This finding provides convincing evidence
that older adults continue to provide assistance to
others even when their own health may be declining.
(3) Of those who provide personal assistance to
others, what types of assistance do they provide, to
whom do older people provide personal assistance,
and what is the association between the type of
personal assistance provided and characteristics of
those who receive assistance? It is not surprising that
older adults are most likely to provide help with
instrumental activities of daily living (including such
things as yard work, light and heavy housework,
making meals, bringing meals to someone, shop-
ping for personal items, etc.), because instrumental
ADLs do not require the intimacy and continuous
proximity of the person providing help, as is the case
with basic and mobility ADLs (Norburn et al., 1995).
Moreover, when assistance with mobility or basic
ADLs is provided, such assistance is generally pro-
Vol. 36, No. 4,1996 481
vided in combination with lADLs and given to a wide
spectrum of individuals.
It has been pointed out by proponents of activity
theory that older persons contribute to society not
only through their volunteer work and assistance to
others but also that these "activities increase their
health and well-being." Therefore, "they benefit
themselves as well as a society that might otherwise
be burdened with the consequences of their bad
health and lowered well-being" (Herzog & House,
1991, pp. 52-53).
In conclusion, it is evident that older adults are a
resource to the communities in which they live.
Although we did not ascertain the age of the person
to whom assistance was provided, it is clear from the
questions we did ask that older adults provide assis-
tance to individuals both related and unrelated to
them, and to persons of all ages. As discussed earlier,
the potential of older people as a resource could be
influenced by a number of factors, some of which
may increase and some of which may decrease the
size of this resource. Increased life expectancy, in
conjunction with increased levels of education and
income and technological advances to improve qual-
ity of life, may increase the likelihood that older
adults will be able to help others, while increased
workforce participation and continued threats to fi-
nancial security (due to cutbacks in Medicare and
increases in the Social Security retirement age) may
reduce the availability of older adults to provide
assistance and serve as resources to others. In the
future, more opportunities should be made available
to further explore the implications and expand the
potential of this resource.
