SMOKING IS THE LEADING PRE-
ventable cause of death in the
United States.1 In an effort to
target public health interven-
tions, recent studies have focused on
smoking in distinct populations, such
as pregnant women2 and adolescents.3
We believe those with mental illness are
another group that merits special at-
tention.
Previous studies have found high
smoking rates among selected popula-
tions of persons with mental illness,
such as psychiatric outpatients4 and pa-
tients in a state mental hospital.5 Oth-
ers have found elevated smoking rates
among patients with specific diag-
noses, such as bipolar illness, depres-
sion, schizophrenia, and panic disor-
der.6-11 Persons with mental illness may
encounter greater difficulty with to-
bacco cessation.4,12,13 However, no re-
cent study has analyzed rates of smok-
ing and quit rates across the spectrum
of psychiatric diagnoses in a nation-
ally representative sample. We hypoth-
esized that persons with mental ill-
ness smoke at higher rates than persons
without mental illness, have lower quit
rates, and comprise a large proportion
of the US tobacco market.
We used population-based data from
the National Comorbidity Survey14
(NCS) to examine the association be-
tween type and severity of mental ill-
ness and the likelihood of smoking and
subsequent cessation. The NCS dif-
fered from previous studies because it
was the first to administer a structured
psychiatric interview to a nationally rep-
resentative sample.15 Furthermore, the
NCS was specifically designed to exam-
ine both substance-use and nonsub-
stance-use psychiatric disorders.
METHODS
Data Sources
The NCS was a congressionally man-
dated study of the prevalence of psy-
chiatric disorders in the United States.15
Administered between September 1990
and February 1992, the survey used a
stratified, multistage probability sample
of persons aged 15 to 54 years in the
noninstitutionalized civilian popula-
tion. The data were released for public
use in 1998. The study design allowed
for estimation of the national preva-
lence of mental illness as defined by the
DiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMen-
tal Disorders, Third Edition, Revised
(DSM-III-R).16

Context Studies of selected groups of persons with mental illness, such as those who
are institutionalized or seen in mental health clinics, have reported rates of smoking to
be higher than in persons without mental illness. However, recent population-based,
nationally representative data are lacking.
Objective To assess rates of smoking and tobacco cessation in adults, with and with-
out mental illness.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data on 4411 respondents aged
15 to 54 years from the National Comorbidity Survey, a nationally representative mul-
tistage probability survey conducted from 1991 to 1992.
Main Outcome Measures Rates of smoking and tobacco cessation according to
the number and type of psychiatric diagnoses, assessed by a modified version of the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Results Current smoking rates for respondents with no mental illness, lifetime men-
tal illness, and past-month mental illness were 22.5%, 34.8%, and 41.0%, respec-
tively. Lifetime smoking rates were 39.1%, 55.3%, and 59.0%, respectively (P.001
for all comparisons). Smokers with any history of mental illness had a self-reported
quit rate of 37.1% (P=.04), and smokers with past-month mental illness had a self-
reported quit rate of 30.5% (P.001) compared with smokers without mental illness
(42.5%). Odds ratios for current and lifetime smoking in respondents with mental ill-
ness in the past month vs respondents without mental illness, adjusted for age, sex,
and region of the country, were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.1) and 2.7
(95% CI, 2.4-3.2), respectively. Persons with a mental disorder in the past month con-
sumed approximately 44.3% of cigarettes smoked by this nationally representative
sample.
Conclusions Persons with mental illness are about twice as likely to smoke as other
persons but have substantial quit rates.

The NCS surveyed 8098 persons.
Questions regarding tobacco use were
asked of the 4411 respondents inter-
viewed during the latter half of the sur-
vey (1991-1992). Specially trained staff
from the Survey Research Center at the
University of Michigan administered
a modified version of the Composite
International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI).17 The CIDI is a well-validated,
structured diagnostic interview based
on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(DIS), which was used in the Epide-
miologic Catchment Area Study.18 In
the NCS, the overall response rate was
82.4%; nonrespondents resembled re-
spondents in age and sex, which are the
only demographic variables available for
all nonrespondents. A supplemental
survey was administered to a random
sample of nonrespondents, who were
found to have elevated rates of both life-
time and current psychiatric disor-
ders. The data were weighted to
account for sample design (ie, prob-
abilities of selection among house-
holds) and for nonresponse using
information from the supplemental sur-
vey. An additional weight was used to
extrapolate the data to the national
population by age, sex, race or ethnic-
ity, marital status, educational level, liv-
ing arrangements, region, and urban-
icity (TABLE 1).
Definitions of Mental Illness
and Tobacco Use
We defined respondents as lifetime
smokers if they answered affirma-
tively to the question, "Have you ever
smoked daily for a month or more?" We
defined current smokers as those who
responded, "in the past month" when
they were asked, "When was the last
time you smoked fairly regularly--in
the past month, past six months, past
year, or more than a year ago?" We de-
fined the quit rate as the proportion of
lifetime smokers who were not cur-
rent smokers. Because this definition of
quit rate differs from that used in other
studies, we also analyzed the data with
a more conservative definition of quit
rate: the proportion of lifetime smok-
ers who had stopped smoking for more
than a year. This analysis did not sig-
nificantly change our findings; hence,
we used the former definition of quit
rate. The NCS did not ascertain the
total lifetime consumption of tobacco
or the current number of cigarettes
smoked. However, respondents were
asked, "How many cigarettes did you
smoke per day during the period when
you were smoking most?" We defined
this number as peak consumption. We
considered persons whose peak con-
sumption exceeded 24 cigarettes per
day to be heavy smokers. We defined
moderate and light smokers as those
whose peak consumption was 24 ciga-
rettes per day or less. We did not ana-
lyze cigar or pipe smoking.
We defined mental illness as major
depression, bipolar disorder, dysthy-
mia, panic disorder, agoraphobia, so-
cial phobia, simple phobia, general-
ized anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse,
alcohol dependence, drug abuse, drug
dependence, antisocial personality, con-
duct disorder, or nonaffective psycho-
sis. The latter includes schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaf-
fective disorder, delusional disorder,
and atypical psychosis.
We analyzed persons with and with-
out any mental illness at any time in
their lives (lifetime mental illness), per-
sons with active mental illness in the
past month (whom we define as "the
mentally ill"), and persons with each
of the individual DSM-III-R diagnoses
and with multiple DSM-III-R diag-
noses. In addition, we compared smok-
ing rates in respondents with current
alcohol and drug use to those of re-
spondents who had been abstinent for
at least 1 year.
We also estimated the proportion of
all cigarettes smoked in the United
States that were consumed by persons
with mental illness via the following
calculation: (M) (C1
) / {(N) (C2
)+(M)
(C1
)}, where M=the number of cur-
rent smokers with mental illness in the
past month; C1
=the mean peak con-
sumption of cigarettes per day by cur-
rent smokers with mental illness in the
past month; N=the number of current
smokers without mental illness in the
past month, which includes persons
with and without lifetime mental ill-
ness; and C2
=the mean peak consump-
tion of cigarettes per day by current
smokers without mental illness in the
past month. For both persons with and
without mental illness, we assumed that
the peak number of cigarettes con-

sumed correlated with the current num-
ber of cigarettes consumed.
Statistical Methods
We used the SAS computer statistical
package (Version 7; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). We used the 2 test to compare
differences between groups in the pro-
portion of personswho smoked, and the
Mantel Haenszel 2 test for trend to
compare smoking rates with the num-
ber of lifetime DSM-III-R diagnoses. We
used logistic regression to analyze men-
tal illness as a predictor of smoking,
while controlling for sex, age, and re-
gion of the United States.
RESULTS
The demographic characteristics of per-
sons with a lifetime history of mental
illness and persons with mental ill-
ness in the past month are shown in
Table 1. The population prevalence of
current smoking was 28.5%, while the
lifetime prevalence was 47.1%. Forty-
one percent of persons who reported
having mental illness in the past month
were current smokers and repre-
sented 40.6% of all current smokers in
the United States. Respondents with a
history of mental illness had elevated
smoking rates, and smoking rates in-
creased further in respondents with
mental illness in the past month
(TABLE 2). Current smokers without
mental illness in the past month
(n=746) had a mean peak consump-
tion of 22.6 cigarettes per day vs 26.2
in those with mental illness in the past
month (n=511). We estimated that per-
sons with mental illness comprised
44.3% of the US tobacco market.
The relationship between smoking
and mental illness persisted when we
controlled for age, sex, and geographic
region using logistic regression (details
availableonrequest).Comparedwithre-
spondents without mental illness, those
with any history of mental illness were
significantly more likely to be lifetime
smokers(oddsratio[OR],2.1;95%con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.4) or cur-
rentsmokers(OR,1.9;95%CI,1.7-2.2).
Thisrelationshipwasstrongeramongre-
spondentswithmentalillnessinthepast
month(OR,2.7;95%CI,2.3-3.1forcur-
rent smokers; OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.4-3.2
for lifetime smokers).
Persons with multiple lifetime psy-
chiatric diagnoses had higher rates of
smoking and smoked more heavily than
persons with only 1 DSM-III-R diagno-
sis (P.001, FIGURE). Heavy smoking
was rare in persons with no history of
mental illness; only 10% of such per-
sons were heavy smokers. We ob-
served a dose-response relationship be-
tweenthenumberoflifetimepsychiatric
diagnoses and smoking rates. Quit rates
were lower in smokers with mental ill-
ness in the past month (30.5%,
P.0001) and in smokers with any life-
time history of mental illness (37.1%,
P=.04) compared with smokers with-
out mental illness (42.5%).
TABLE 3 and TABLE 4 show smok-
ing rates according to psychiatric di-
agnosis (lifetime and in the past
month), as well as the corresponding
quit rates. The quit rates of respon-
dents who were abstinent from alco-
hol (41.5%) or drugs (39.0%) were
similar to the quit rate of persons with
no mental illness history (42.5%). Due
to small numbers in some diagnostic
categories, differences between indi-
vidual diagnoses should be inter-
preted cautiously.
COMMENT
We found that persons with mental ill-
ness are about twice as likely to smoke
as other persons, a finding consistent
with previous studies.4,6,19,20 Population-
based data collected in the early 1980s
by the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
Study showed that persons with ma-
jor depression, dysthymia, agorapho-
bia, and alcoholism were 1.6 to 4.7
times more likely to have ever smoked
than subjects without mental illness.6
However, we observed that more than
a third of patients with a history of men-
tal illness had quit smoking by the time
of the survey. The quit rate in the Epi-
demiologic Catchment Area Study was
lower than this and was only deter-
mined for persons with major depres-
sion. Our finding that persons absti-
nent from alcohol had quit rates equal
to those of persons without mental ill-
ness confirms previous findings.21 How-
ever, our finding that persons absti-
nent from drugs also had quit rates
equal to those of persons without men-
tal illness is a novel one.
Our study is based on data collected
from 1991 to 1992 and released for pub-
lic use in 1998, the most recent na-
tionaldataavailableonmentalillnessand

the prevalence of smoking in the United
States over the past decade, from 26.5%
in 1992 to 24.7% in 1997,22 our find-
ings are still pertinent. Similarly, we
doubt that the prevalence of mental ill-
ness has decreased dramatically since
1992. In the NCS, almost half of the re-
spondents had experienced a DSM-III-
R­defined mental illness in their life-
time, and 28% had experienced mental
illness in the past month. These num-
bers appear high because the definition
of mental illness in the NCS (the stan-
dard definition used by most psychia-
trists in the United States) encom-
passedabroadspectrumofseverity,from
simple phobia to schizophrenia.
Mentally-ill cigarette smokers, like
other smokers, are at high risk of smok-
ing-related deaths. Persons with ma-
jor depression, alcohol disorders, and
schizophrenia have high mortality rates
from vascular disease and cancer.23
Smoking also complicates the treat-
ment of some mental disorders by de-
creasing blood levels of neurolep-
tics.24 Thus, smokers may require larger
doses to achieve therapeutic effect, and
thereby run an increased risk of ad-
verse effects.13,25,26 Some26,27 but not
all28,29 studies have found that smok-
ers experience more tardive dyskine-
sia than nonsmokers.
Why do the mentally ill smoke more?
Some have suggested that such per-
sons use cigarettes as a means of self-
medication of psychiatric symp-
toms.13,30 This theory implicitly assumes
that mental illness causes smoking.
However,recentfindings9-10,31 raiseques-
tions about the direction of causality. In
a study of childhood and adolescent de-
pression,31 antecedent smoking was as-
sociated with an increased risk of de-
pression, but not vice-versa. Similarly,
current smokers have an elevated risk
of first-time occurrence of panic at-
tacks relative to nonsmokers or former
smokers,10 and smoking may increase
the risk of certain anxiety disorders dur-
ing late adolescence and early adult-
hood.32 Lastly,arecentstudy9 foundthat
smoking preceded the onset of schizo-
phrenia in the majority of persons with
schizophrenia who smoked.
Internal documents from the to-
bacco industry suggest that the indus-
try has identified psychologically vul-
nerable persons as a part of their
tobacco market. In the 1981 Segmen-
tation Study,33 market researchers at R.
J. Reynolds Tobacco Co described
smokers who smoked for "mood en-
hancement" and "positive stimula-
tion."Thismarketingstudyimplied that
smokers used nicotine for depressive
symptoms, stating that smoking "helps

perk you up" and "helps you think out
problems." The authors also identi-
fied the role of smoking in "anxiety re-
lief,"stating that smoking helped people
"gain self-control," "calm down," and
"cope with stress." While studies have
shown that cigarette advertising and
promotion influence smoking in ado-
lescents,34 no studies have examined the
effect of cigarette advertising on the
mentally ill.
Extrapolating our results to the US
population, we estimate that persons
with a diagnosable mental disorder in
the past month consume nearly half of
all cigarettes smoked in the United
States. Our findings emphasize the
importance of focusing smoking pre-
vention and cessation efforts on the
mentally ill. Individual clinicians'
efforts in this regard need to be
coupled with broader public policy
interventions. Increases in tobacco
taxes and antismoking media cam-
paigns have been shown to reduce
cigarette sales and consumption,35-38
particularly in lower-income smok-
ers.37 While data are not available on
the impact of tobacco taxation on the
subpopulation of smokers with mental
illness, we believe that taxation might
be an effective smoking deterrent in
this group, which tends to be at a low-
income level. Tax revenues could then
be used to fund smoking cessation and
other programs for persons with men-
tal illness and to support counter-
advertising campaigns.
Mental illness carries a unique bur-
den of suffering--an "inexplicable
agony"--according to one eloquent vic-
tim.39 The mentally ill also carry the
burden of nearly half of all US tobacco
consumption. However, the fact that
smokers with mental illness are able to
quit should offer hope.
