Trends
Financial Burden Of Health Care, 2001­2004
The same affordability issues that low-income families experienced a
decade ago have begun to affect middle-income families today.
by Jessica S. Banthin, Peter Cunningham, and Didem M. Bernard
ABSTRACT: Analysis of data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) shows
that rising out-of-pocket expenses and stagnant incomes increased health spending's fi-
nancial burden for families in 2001­2004, especially for the privately insured. High finan-
cial burdens among those with nongroup coverage increased by more than one-third. De-
spite evidence of increased cost sharing in private insurance plans, our analysis does not
show that privately insured people paid a higher share of their total health care bill in 2004
compared to 2001. Financial burdens have increased to the point at which private insur-
ance is no longer able to provide financial protection for an increasing number of families.
[Health Affairs 27, no. 1 (2008): 188­195; 10.1377/hlthaff.27.1.188]
Rising health care costs are one
reason for a dramatic increase in
Americans' dissatisfaction with the
health care system in recent years.1 In the first
part of this decade, health care costs contin-
ued to increase at rates far above general in-
flation, and employers increasingly shifted
these higher costs to workers in the form of
higher out-of-pocket payments for premiums,
deductibles, and copayments.2 Adding to the
pressure on families was slower economic
growth during 2001­2004, which resulted in
increases in poverty rates and the number of
uninsured people.3
Understanding whether these trends are
resulting in greater financial burdens on fami-
lies is important, since high financial burdens
can lead to greater medical debt, problems
paying medical bills, and bankruptcy.4 In addi-
tion, high financial burdens are often obstacles
to medical care access, as many families (in-
cluding privately insured families) with prob-
lems paying their medical bills delay or forgo
needed medical care.5 Although these con-
cerns have been directed primarily at unin-
sured people, many families with private in-
surance--especially those with low
incomes--are having difficulty paying medical
bills.
Prior research based on data from the Med-
ical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
showed that out-of-pocket spending--as well
as the financial burden of these expenses--in-
creased for families between 1996 and 2003.6
In this paper we extend that analysis by pro-
viding estimates of out-of-pocket spending for
2004 (the latest data available) and focus on
the changes in out-of-pocket spending and
families' financial burdens since 2001. We fo-
cus on 2001­2004 because it was a period
when financial pressures on American families
resulting from health care costs were likely in-

creasing. For example, annual increases in
health care costs averaged 8.3 percent during
2001­2004, while average family incomes in-
creased only 1.6 percent, on average.7 This was
in sharp contrast to the period 1996­2000,
when average annual increases in health care
costs (5.9 percent) were only slightly higher
than increases in income (4.6 percent).
Study Data And Methods
n Data source. Our analysis is based on
data from MEPS for 2001 and 2004. The MEPS
household survey, sponsored by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),
collects detailed information on health care
spending and use of services, insurance cover-
age, sources of payment, health status, em-
ployment, and other sociodemographic details
from individuals and families. Household re-
ports on use of services are supplemented with
information on third-party payments and bill-
ing codes from medical care providers' billing
records. Sample sizes are 28,295 for 2001 and
28,990 for 2004, for people under age sixty-
five. Our results are weighted to be nationally
representative of the U.S. civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population of that age group.
n Families' health care burden. We de-
fine health care burden as the ratio of total family
out-of-pocket spending for health care ser-
vices and premiums over total family income.
Both financial burden for health care and in-
come are measured at the family level, since
family members typically share financial re-
sources and are likely to be affected by each
other's medical costs. All of our results and
population estimates are reported at the per-
son level. Each person in our sample is as-
signed the family-level burden measure.
n Family income. Family income is mea-
sured after taxes (disposable income), because
this is a more accurate reflection of families' re-
sources, especially for the working-age popu-
lation.8 Income and spending for 2001 are in-
flated to 2004 values using the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) for urban areas.
n High-burden individuals. People who
live in families that spend more than 10 per-
cent of family income on health care are de-
fined as individuals with high burdens. This
method, which has been used in several other
studies, reduces bias resulting from reporting
error in income and also provides an intuitive
measure of the risk of incurring high financial
burdens.9
n Differential spending thresholds. We
also consider a measure that uses a lower
threshold for low-income people (that is, peo-
ple whose out-of-pocket costs exceed 5 per-
cent of income for low-income people and 10
percent for all others) because it is assumed
that low-income people have much less capac-
ity than their higher-income peers to absorb
high out-of-pocket spending, and this is con-
sistent with public program requirements in
Medicaid and the State Children's Health In-
surance Program (SCHIP).10 However, using
inconsistent thresholds across income groups
would bias estimates of disparities in burden
levels by income.11
n Insurance categories and premiums.
People without coverage all year are classified
as uninsured. We assigned the rest to one of
three mutually exclusive insurance categories
based on the type of coverage they held for the
longest period of time during the year (mea-
sured monthly). In the event of a tie, we as-
signed the person to the highest-ranking in-
surance status category in this order: private
employment-related group, private nongroup,
or public.
Premiums include those paid out of pocket
for private policies reported in MEPS and sim-
ulated Medicare Part B premiums for anyone
enrolled in Medicare and not eligible for
Medicaid premium support. All premiums are
prorated to account for the duration of cover-
age during the year.
Study Results
n Financial burden of health care. The
financial burden of health care increased for
American families during the first part of this
decade as a result of rising out-of-pocket
spending for health care and stagnant family
incomes. Between 2001 and 2004, the percent-
age of the nonelderly population living in fami-
lies with high out-of-pocket health care bur-

dens rose from 15.9 percent to 17.7 percent
(Exhibit 1). By 2004, 45.4 million people lived
in families with high burdens--an increase of
almost six million from 2001.12
Increases in out-of-pocket spending be-
tween 2001 and 2004 were driven by both in-
creases in health insurance premium payments
and spending on health care services. Even af-
ter general inflation is accounted for, total out-
of-pocket spending on health care rose by $373
to $2,656 in 2004, an increase of about 16 per-
cent over the three-year period. In contrast, av-
erage family incomes not only failed to keep
pace with rising out-of-pocket spending dur-
ing this period but were largely unchanged af-
ter general inflation was accounted for.
n Health insurance coverage and finan-
cial burden. The increase in families' financial
burdens was driven entirely by people with
private (employer-sponsored) insurance: 17
percent (or twenty-nine million people) faced
high burdens in 2004, an increase of 2.3 per-
centage points from 2001. Together, out-of-
pocket spending for premiums and services
rose $553 to $3,211, a 21 percent increase over
the period. The increase in high financial bur-
dens would have been even greater if not for a
small rise in family incomes (4.6 percent) for
privately insured people during this period.

small in number, people covered by private
policies purchased in the nongroup market
were much more likely than those in any other
insurance group to bear high financial burdens
during 2001­2004. This was because people
with private nongroup insurance must pay the
entire premium, and benefits in such plans are
often less generous than those in employer-
sponsored plans. Moreover, the percentage of
people with nongroup plans experiencing
high out-of-pocket burdens rose dramatically,
from 39 percent in 2001 to
52.7 percent in 2004.
The large increase in bur-
dens for those with nongroup
coverage may have reflected
the fact that younger and
healthier people dropped this
coverage as costs increased.
However, our results show no
decrease in the numbers en-
rolled in nongroup coverage,
and there was also no change
during 2001­2004 in the aver-
age age of people covered by
these plans (findings not
shown). Therefore, increases in burden more
likely reflected large increases in premiums
and deductibles among people enrolled in
nongroup plans, which do not have employers
as a partial buffer to help absorb higher health
care costs.
Uninsured and public coverage. There was no
change in financial burdens among the unin-
sured and those with public coverage. About
one-sixth of the publicly insured (or 6.4 mil-
lion people) faced high financial burdens in
2004. Although out-of-pocket spending by the
publicly insured was much lower than by the
privately insured ($712 on average), even mod-
est expenses are financially burdensome to a
population that is mostly poor and low income
("poor" is defined as less than 100 percent of
the federal poverty level; "low income," 100­
199 percent). For the uninsured, lower out-of-
pocket spending and comparable burden lev-
els relative to privately insured people re-
flected lower medical care access and use.
Only about 55 percent of the uninsured used
any health services in 2004, compared to 88.1
percent of those with employer-sponsored
coverage (findings not shown).
n Financial burden and income. The
burdens were highest among poor and low-
income people with private insurance, a sub-
group of particular policy concern.13 We found
that 53.5 percent of poor and 37.4 percent of
low-income people with private insurance
faced high financial burdens in 2004, about
two times as high as middle-income people
faced and four times as high
as high-income people faced
(Exhibit 2). Moreover, finan-
cial burdens increased be-
tween 2001 and 2004 for low-
income people, which indi-
cates that private coverage
was becoming less affordable
for this group. At the same
time, one out of five privately
insured people with incomes
of 200­399 percent of poverty
(middle income) spent more
than 10 percent of their in-
come on health care, a rate
that is twice as high as that for higher-income
people.
Out-of-pocket spending for both premiums
and services contributed to high financial bur-
dens for poor and low-income people. For ex-
ample, among the privately insured, 30.1 per-
cent of poor and 21.9 percent of low-income
people incurred high financial burdens from
the premium alone in 2004 (Exhibit 3). It
might be argued that families choose to pay
the out-of-pocket premium and plan their
budget to cover the regular and predictable
payments that premiums typically involve. Yet
39.7 percent of poor and 10.4 percent of low-
income people incurred high burdens solely
from the less predictable out-of-pocket spend-
ing on services in 2004.
n Share of total health spending paid
for out of pocket. Increases in out-of-pocket
spending for deductibles and copayments have
generated concern about employers' "buy-
down" of their employees' health benefits,
compelling enrollees to pay a higher share of

their total health care bill. However, we found
that the share of total health care spending
paid for out of pocket actually decreased
slightly, from 34.8 percent in 2001 to 33.6 per-
cent in 2004 (Exhibit 4).14 People with non-
group coverage paid a much higher share of
their total health care bill out of pocket (55.3
percent) than did those with employer-spon-
sored coverage (31.9 percent), although there
was no statistically significant change in the
share paid for out of pocket for either group
between 2001 and 2004. People with public
coverage paid the lowest share out of pocket
(13.5 percent), while those without insurance
paid the highest share (72.2 percent).
Discussion
The trend of increasing financial burdens
among the privately insured has likely contin-
ued since 2004, although perhaps at a some-
what lower rate. Annual increases in health in-
surance premiums have slowed from a high of
13.9 percent in 2003 to 6.1 percent in 2007, but
they are still higher than general inflation and
growth in workers' wages.15 Recent projec-
tions estimate that both overall private health
insurance costs and out-of-pocket spending
will continue to rise by about 6­7 percent an-
nually through 2016.16 Financial burdens for
health care may therefore continue to grow as
well, since growth in incomes is unlikely to
keep pace with increases in the cost of care,
depending on changes in benefit design as well
as consumers' responses to any changes in
benefits and coverage.
Our study shows that private health insur-
ance, as currently structured, does not com-
pletely protect many poor and low-income in-
dividuals and families from the high cost of
health care. This group is of particular policy
concern because these trends indicate that
many Americans are underinsured and going
without needed medical care.17 Also, increases
in health care costs have greatly eroded private
coverage of poor and low-income people over
the past twenty years, which for children has

In the debate about whether SCHIP should
be expanded beyond the 200 percent poverty
threshold, a key question is the extent to
which middle-income families can still afford
private coverage. Compared to poor and low-
income people, the prevalence of high financial
burdens during our study period was much
lower for privately insured people in middle-

income families. Still, one out of five privately
insured people in middle-income families
faced high financial burdens, and this number
is likely to increase in future years as health
care costs continue to outpace growth in fam-
ily incomes. Thus, the same affordability issues
that low-income families experienced a de-
cade ago might affect middle-income families
in the future.
Subsidizing out-of-pocket premiums for
low- and moderate-income workers who have
access to employer-sponsored coverage is an
alternative way to increase the affordability of
private coverage. Premium assistance pro-
grams are appealing because they offer the po-
tential to cover a larger number of people with
fewer public dollars; however, these efforts of-
ten ignore the financial burden associated
with out-of-pocket spending for health care
services. Limiting this spending might be as
crucial as premium subsidies to the success of
these programs.19
At the same time, other developments
could lead to increased financial burdens.
States have greater ability to impose cost-
sharing requirements in their Medicaid pro-
grams as a result of the 2005 Deficit Reduction
Act (DRA). Although there are still strict lim-
its on the amount of cost sharing that benefi-
ciaries can incur, our study shows that finan-
cial burdens among families with Medicaid
enrollees are not insubstantial. Policymakers
should consider the possibility that state and
federal cost containment efforts could increase
these burdens even more.

curity and Medicare taxes on earnings using the
Web-based version of TAXSIM 5.0. (National
Bureau of Economic Research, Internet TAXSIM
Version 5.0, at http://www.nber.org/~taxsim). In
addition, we imposed a $100 floor for after-tax
family income to deal with underreporting and
cases of legitimately low or negative incomes,
which affects only 3.3 percent of observations.

12. The 2004 estimate of 17.7 percent with high bur-
dens is lower than the estimate for 2003 (19.2
percent) reported in an earlier study using
MEPS: Banthin and Bernard, "Changes in Finan-
cial Burdens for Health Care." Although the
change between 2003 and 2004 is statistically
significant and represents a decrease in the per-
centage with burdens, it is likely the result of
year-to-year fluctuations in the data rather than
the start of a new trend. Regardless, the conclu-
sions of this study do not change when compar-
ing 2001 with 2003 or 2004, which shows bur-
den levels increasing during a period of rapidly
rising health care costs and stagnant incomes.
13. In Exhibits 2 and 3, employment-related and
nongroup coverage is combined because sample
sizes for nongroup coverage among poor, low-
income, and middle-income people are too small
for reliable estimates. Trends for group coverage
by income tend to be similar to overall private
insurance coverage.
14. We computed the average percentage paid out of
pocket among people with an expense. Thus, the
20 percent paid by one person was averaged with
the 40 percent paid by another, regardless of the
size of the total payment.
