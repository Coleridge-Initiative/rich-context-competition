GENERATIVITY, that is, concern and activity dedicated
to contributing to the well-being of others, especially
younger generations, is postulated to be an important devel-
opmental goal of midlife and beyond (Erikson, 1950,
1997/1982). Although generative desires and behavior are
thought to peak in midlife when generative role demands and
resources (social, economic, cognitive) are greatest, accumu-
lating evidence suggests that generative desire and activity
remain high for some older adults (see McAdams, 2001;
Stewart & Vandewater, 1998). Desires to be useful to and to
contribute to others are often cited motivations for social and
productive engagement in later life (Narushima, 2005; Okun,
1994). Such engagement is a key component of many models
of successful aging (Depp & Jeste, 2006; Fischer, 1995;
Rowe & Kahn, 1998) and is linked to better cognitive and
physical well-being in older adulthood (Adams, Leibbrandt,
& Moon, 2010; Gottlieb & Gillespie, 2008).
Older adults' perceptions of important components of
generativity (e.g., feeling needed and useful) may also be
linked to health trajectories in later life. Not feeling needed
by others predicted greater risk of institutionalization and
death (for a period of 5­10 years) in older Finnish birth
cohorts (aged 75­85; Pitkala, Laakkonen, Strandberg, & Tilvis,
2004). Similarly, rural-dwelling French (aged 60) and
Japanese (aged 65) elders with low (vs. high) feelings of
social usefulness were more likely to experience increases
in activities of daily living (ADLs) impairment or to die
over 4- to 6-year follow-ups (Grand, Grosclaude, Bocquet,
Pous, & Albarede, 1988, 1990; Okamoto & Tanaka, 2004).
These associations were replicated in analyses of high-
functioning older Americans (aged 70­79 years). Among
older adults initially disability-free, those with low (vs.
high) feelings of social usefulness were more likely to show
increases in ADL disability or to die (more than 7.5 years),
and those with persistently low or declining feelings of
usefulness experienced shorter longevity (Gruenewald,
Karlamangla, Greendale, Singer, & Seeman, 2007, 2009).
The current analyses add to these prior investigations by
examining whether self-perceptions of generativity predict
risk of disability increase or mortality for a 10-year period
in a national sample of older adults (aged 60­75 years) from
the Study of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). An
important limitation of much of the prior research in this
area is the use of samples of high-functioning elders or from
select geographic locales (e.g., rural dwelling). Another
limitation of previous research is the limited measurement
of generativity components (i.e., feeling needed, feeling
useful to others). The present investigation examines the
health correlates of generativity using both an indicator of
perceived level of current contributions to others and a brief
version of the widely used Loyola Generativity Scale
(McAdams & de St.Aubin, 1992) that taps multiple generativity
components (having made important contributions to others,
feeling needed, having socially-valued skills). An additional
contribution of the present investigation is the examination
of three potential pathways through which we hypothesize

Objectives. To examine whether perceptions of generativity predict the likelihood of increases in levels of impairment
in activities of daily living (ADLs) or of dying over a 10-year period in older adults aged 60­75 from the Study of Midlife
in the United States (MIDUS).
Method. Perceptions of generativity and current generative contributions as well as select sociodemographic, health
status, health behavior, and psychosocial factors, assessed at a baseline exam, were examined as predictors of change in
ADL disability level or mortality over the 10-year period between the baseline and follow-up waves of the MIDUS Study.
Results. Greater levels of generativity and generative contributions at baseline predicted lower odds of experiencing
increases in ADL disability (2 or more new domains of impairment; generativity odds ratio [OR] = 0.93 and generative
contributions OR = 0.87), or of dying (generativity OR = 0.94 and generative contributions OR = 0.88), over the 10-year
follow-up in models adjusted for sociodemographics and baseline health and disability. Associations remained relatively
unchanged with the inclusion of different sets of health behavior and psychosocial variables in analytic models.
Discussion. Findings indicate that greater perceptions of generativity are associated with more favorable trajectories
of physical functioning and longevity over time in older adults.

perceptions of generativity may be linked to physical health
outcomes: (a) health-related behavior, (b) social and produc-
tive engagement, and (c) affective well-being. Those who feel
more generative may take better care of themselves to maintain
their ability to contribute, engage in more social and productive
activity, and experience greater affective well-being, all of
which may be paths to better physical well-being.
Method
Participants
MIDUS is currently a two-wave [MIDUS I (MI): 1995­
1996; MIDUS II (MII): 2004­2006] longitudinal study of
factors associated with healthy aging in a national sample of
adults (aged 25 to 74 at baseline). At both waves, partici-
pants completed telephone (MI n = 7,108; MII n = 4,963)
and mail (MI n = 6,325; MII n =4,032) surveys. Given our
focus on links between generativity and health in older
adulthood, the current analyses focus on the subset of
MIDUS participants aged 60­75 at baseline (n = 1,353).
Measures
Unless otherwise stated, study variables were assessed at
the MI baseline.
Perceived generativity.--Perceived generativity was calcu-
lated as the sum of six items assessing agreement on a 4-point
scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (a lot), with indicators
of past and current generative desires and behaviors (made
unique contributions to society, feel others need you, have
skills to pass along, many come to you for advice, like to teach
others, have a good influence on others; scale alpha = 0.84)
taken from the Loyola Generativity Scale (McAdams & de St.
Aubin, 1992). A second measure assessed perceptions of
current generative contributions by asking respondents to rate
their current level of contribution to the welfare and well-being
of others, including friends, family, and the community, using
an 11-point scale from 0 (worst possible) to 10 (best possible).
Sociodemographic and health status covariates.--
Sociodemographic covariates included age, sex, educa-
tional attainment (high school, some college), and race/
ethnicity (coded as White or non-White due to the small
proportion of non-White participants; 3.6% Black or African
American, 2.4% multirace, 0.7% other). Indicators of health
status included body mass index (BMI) and the total number
of nine health conditions (hypertension, heart disease,
stroke, neurological disorder, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune
disease, lung problems, and AIDS) experienced in the last
year or ever (for heart disease and cancer).
Behavioral and psychosocial covariates.--Physical
activity level was assessed as a summary of the frequency
(6-point scale: 1 [never] to 6 [several times a week or more])
measure of moderate and vigorous (frequency weighted by
1.5) physical activity. Smoking status was coded as non-, ex-,
or current smoker. Social contact variables included presence
of marital or marital-like partner and frequency of contact
with nonhousehold family members and friends (8-point
scale: 1 [never/hardly ever] to 8 [several times a day]) and
neighbors (6-point scale: 1 [never/hardly ever] to 6 [almost
every day]). Emotional and instrumental support provision
(hours per month) were assessed across multiple recipients
(spouse/partner, parents, in-laws, children/grandchildren,
other family, close friends, others). Productive activity
variables included volunteer activity (hours per month) and
paid employment (1 [yes], 0 [no]). Affective well-being
was assessed as the average frequency (5-point scale: 1
[none of the time] to 5 [all of the time]) of five negative
emotions (e.g., nervous, worthless, sad) experienced in the
last month.
Change in disability and mortality occurrence.--Activities
of daily living impairment at both MIDUS assessments was
measured as the total number of six ADLs that participants
reported "a lot" of difficulty in performing: lifting or carry-
ing groceries, bathing or dressing, climbing several flights
of stairs, walking several blocks, bending, kneeling or
stooping, and moderate physical activity (e.g., vacuuming).
Mortality status was obtained through National Death Index
(NDI) searches through 2006 and next of kin reports during
MII follow-up. Disability change and mortality information
were combined into a four-category outcome variable: no
change or slight improvement inADL disability (from base-
line), small disability increase (1­2 new impairments),
moderate to large disability increase (3 new impairments),
or death over the follow-up.
Analyses
Complete data for measures examined in analyses, MI
and MII disability, and mortality occurrence over the follow-up
were available for 855 of the 1,353 individuals aged 60 and
older at baseline (313 were missing data on one or more
measures, 285 neither participated in the MII exam nor
were identified in NDI searches). Comparisons of those
included and excluded from analyses on the basis of missing
data indicated no significant differences for study variables
except those included were more likely to be college edu-
cated, men, married, and to have lower negative affect and
slightly higher levels of perceived generative contributions.
Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the
odds of each disability change or mortality outcome cate-
gory over the follow-up as a function of baseline generativity.
The baseline model included baseline ADL disability,
health, and sociodemographic covariates. Five additional
models added different sets of baseline covariates reflecting
hypothesized paths through which generativity may be
linked to health outcomes: (a) health behaviors, (b) social

activity, (c) social support provision, (d) productive activity,
and (e) affect. A final model included baseline model
covariates and significant covariates (p  .10) from previous
models. Analyses accounted for clustering by family mem-
bership given the presence of twin and sibling participants
in the sample. STATA (v.11) was utilized for analyses.
Results
Descriptive statistics for study variables are presented in
Table 1. Approximately a quarter of the sample died, a little
under a quarter showed small or moderate to large disability
increases, and approximately half showed no change or
slight improvements in ADL impairment.
Inspection of associations between generativity measures
and study covariates (data not shown) indicated that those
who felt more generative had more frequent social contact,
provided more support to others, volunteered more, were
more physically active, had lower levels of negative affect,
were more likely to be married and college educated, and
less likely to smoke. Only perceived current generative

contributions showed weak negative associations with base-
line ADL impairment and BMI, and neither generativity
measure was significantly associated with baseline health
condition burden. The two generativity measures were
moderately correlated (r = 0.43).
As documented inTable 2, for both generativity measures,
greater perceptions of generativity at baseline predicted sig-
nificantly lower odds of increased ADL disability or mor-
tality over the follow-up (odds of slight increase in disability
as a function of the multi-item generativity measure was not
significant), when accounting for baseline health, disability,
and sociodemographic factors. The inclusion of different
sets of health behavior, social and productive engagement,
and affective well-being covariates led to little change in
odds ratio (OR) estimates for generativity predictors. How-
ever, for the multi-item generativity measure, estimates for
mortality were reduced to marginal significance in models
including health behavior covariates and in the full multi-
variate model.
Supplementary Analyses
Analyses were repeated with missing values estimated
(via STATA's Imputation by Chained Equations algorithm)
with three imputation approaches: (a) A model imputing all
missing data except missing outcome data, (b) A model
additionally imputing missing outcome data, and (c) A model
incorporating outcome variable information in the imputa-
tion process but excluding cases with missing outcome
data from analyses. Analyses using all three approaches
(10 imputed datasets utilized in each approach) produced
a very similar pattern of results to those obtained with
complete case analyses.
Discussion
Results indicate that older adults in their 60s and 70s with
greater self-perceptions of generativity were less likely to
experience increases in ADL disability or to die as they
aged into their 70s and 80s. These findings are consistent
with previous research linking components of generativity
(feeling useful, feeling needed) and disability and mortality
outcomes in older adulthood (Grand et al., 1988, 1990;
Gruenewald et al., 2007, 2009; Okamoto & Tanaka, 2004;
Pitkala et al., 2004). An important contribution of the pre-
sent investigation is the documentation of these associations
in a national sample of older Americans, as most previous
investigations have examined select samples of older adults
(e.g., high-functioning older Americans, rural-dwelling
Japanese or French elders). Although there is no reason to
expect that links between generativity perceptions and
health should be unique to these populations, replication in
a national sample further bolsters the hypothesis that feeling
generative may be health-enhancing in older adulthood.
The measure of perceived level of current generative con-
tributions showed a stronger association with likelihood of
disability increase and mortality as compared with results
for the multi-item perceived generativity scale, although
both were associated with better outcomes. This could indi-
cate that strong associations for one or more generativity

subcomponents are masked by averaging across the mul-
tiple scale indicators. However, supplementary analyses
indicated similar OR estimates for disability and mortality
outcomes for each of the individual scale indicators, albeit
some point estimates were nonsignificant or marginally sig-
nificant (data not shown). Another possibility may be that
the measure of perceived level of current generative contri-
butions best captures a component of generativity that
is an active ingredient in promoting better health in later
life.Additional research with investigations designed to more
comprehensively measure different generativity components
and trajectories of health in later life is needed to address
these questions.
Although greater perceptions of generativity were associ-
ated with a more favorable profile on psychosocial and
behavioral measures, the magnitude of associations between
generativity perceptions and disability and mortality risk
remained relatively unchanged when accounting for these
covariates in analyses. Greater perceptions of generativity
also predicted lower risk of increased disability and mor-
tality when accounting for sociodemographic factors and
baseline disability and health condition burden. On the one
hand, these findings indicate that associations between
generativity and disability and mortality are not confounded
by these other factors. However, it also indicates that more
research is needed to understand the pathways through
which perceptions of generativity may be linked to physical
health over time.
One important limitation of the present investigation is
that even though the MIDUS sample is a national sample,
the representation of those at the extremes of the socioeco-
nomic spectrum and of racial ethnic minorities is lower than
in the general U.S. population. Such characteristics are not
uncommon for national telephone and mail surveys, but do
raise the possibility that results may not generalize to all
older Americans. In addition, although there were relatively
few differences between those included and excluded from
analyses due to missing data, the two groups did differ on
some variables (e.g., education, negative affect, perceived
generative contributions). These differences raise the con-
cern that study findings may be dependent on characteris-
tics of the analytic sample (e.g., associations may be
stronger in those who are more advantaged). However, the
similar pattern of results for analyses with missing data im-
puted with multiple approaches does suggest that results
may not be limited to the analytic sample. A final limitation
is that measures of perceived generativity were limited to a
single baseline assessment. Identifying the health correlates
of change in these perceptions over time is an important
objective of future research with the MIDUS cohort.
In summary, the current investigation indicates that older
adults in their 60s and 70s who feel more generative are less
likely to show increases in physical disability or to die as
they age into their 70s and 80s. These findings suggest that
health promotion scientists and society at large may want to
devote further attention to understanding factors that main-
tain and enhance perceptions of generativity in later life.
