Abstract
Objective: Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have been argued to have the poten-
tial to complement current pharmacological approaches to improving quality of life for people
living with dementia. The aim of this review was to identify, synthesise and appraise the evidence
for the effectiveness of multimodal non-pharmacological interventions for improving cognitive
function specifically.
Method: After a comprehensive search strategy including grey literature, 26 studies were
reviewed. The inclusion criteria concerned adults with a primary diagnosis of dementia.
Studies used two or more different modes of intervention, and measured a cognitive outcome.
Due to differences in the conceptualisations of the term `multimodal', a typology of modes and
methods was developed to facilitate classification of candidate studies.
Results: Twenty-one group studies and five case studies were found. Group studies used two or
three modes of intervention and multiple methods to implement them. Interventions utilised
were cognitive, physical, psychological and psychosocial, nutrition, fasting, gut health, sleep
hygiene, stress reduction, detoxification, hormonal health and oxygen therapy. Five individual
case studies were found in two separate papers. Each personalised patient treatment utilised
in-depth assessments and prescribed up to nine different modes. In 19 (90%) of the 21 group
comparisons, participants were reported to have cognitive improvements, stability with their

clinical change was variable.
Conclusion: Multimodal non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to complement
singular therapeutic approaches by addressing multiple modifiable risk factors currently under-
stood to contribute towards cognitive decline.

Introduction
The latest estimate of people affected by dementia worldwide is 50 million (Pickett et al.,
2018), with a further nine million people developing dementia yearly (WHO, 2017).
Current narratives suggest that the progression of dementia is inevitable, supported by
the results of pharmacological trials which have been less than encouraging (Cummings,
Morstorf, & Zhong, 2014). However, regardless of whether improvements in drug effi-
cacy are possible, people with dementia often have other long-term conditions and so
additional medication can cause unpleasant interactions with existing regimes. On the
other hand, non-pharmacological interventions can provide complementary therapy,
offering useful, versatile approaches to improve outcomes for people with dementia
(Olazaran et al., 2010).
Whilst a number of abilities are affected in people with dementia, its primary manifes-
tation is through reduced cognitive ability. Global cognition is a broad term covering
various cognitive functions including memory, executive functioning (time management,
judgement, planning), attention (ability to direct energy to perform the task at hand, orga-
nise tasks into a coherent logical pattern), language and communication. Cognitive inter-
ventions (CIs) in people with dementia have been classified by Clare and Woods (2004) into
three basic types ­ cognitive stimulation (CS), training (CT) and rehabilitation (CR).
According to Buschert et al. (2011), training for specific cognitive functions is less useful
for more impaired participants, but stimulation and activation of everyday functions tend to
be more meaningful and successful. Overall, studies show evidence of small but consistent
effects of CI in improving cognition (Alves et al., 2013). Moreover, evidence suggests that
utilising more than one method of CI can incrementally improve cognition of people with
dementia (Barban et al., 2016; Cotelli et al., 2014; Lee, Choi, Oh, Sohn, & Lee, 2016;
Panerai, 2016).
Another intervention with potential is routine physical exercise (Olazaran et al., 2010).
Exercise increases the size of the hippocampus and improves memory in older adults
(Erickson et al., 2011). For example, better cognitive scores, after 6 to 12 months of exercise,
were found by Ahlskog, Geda, Graff-Radford, and Petersen (2011) who recommended
exercise as a disease-modifying treatment. In particular, there is evidence of a beneficial
cognitive effect of high intensity exercise interventions (Livingston et al., 2017). In a meta-
analysis of 802 patients in 18 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) the combination of
aerobic and non-aerobic exercise interventions (offered at both high and low frequency)
positively influenced cognition in patients with dementia (Groot et al., 2016).
2 Dementia 0(0)
Another mode worthy of investigation is nutritional modification, with micronutrients,
vitamins and antioxidants showing some evidence of attenuating disease progression (Aliev
et al., 2013) and improving cognition through mitochondrial energy production and protein
synthesis (Troesch, Weber, & Mohajeri, 2016). Proper nutrition is also related to AD
through epigenetic pathways, suggesting a potential role in the prevention of late-onset
AD and attenuation of cognitive deficits (Athanasopoulos, Karagiannis, & Tsolaki, 2016).
As well as CIs, physical exercise and nutrition, numerous other modes can reduce the risk
for dementia or address the symptoms. Whilst several of these are trialled in the included
studies, more are emerging from new evidence that nearly 600 factors can potentiate the
development of AD (Kostoff, Zhang, Ma, Porter, & Buchtel, 2017). This understanding that
dementia is multifactorial and determined by mechanisms that interact and intervene
throughout life (Van der Linden & Juillerat Van der Linden, 2016) has given rise to the
emergence of multimodal approaches to prevention.
Dementia prevention trials affirm that risk factors can be reduced when using a multi-
modal approach, as multiple mechanisms may be necessary for clinically significant effects
on global cognition (Ngandu et al., 2015). Indeed, activities containing more than one
component seem to be more beneficial in reducing risk (Karp et al., 2006). These may
exert a synergistic effect, for instance, whereby physical training guided by CT may facilitate
the neuroplastic potential to induce beneficial cognitive effects (Bamidis et al., 2015), con-
trolling cognitive decline and improving quality of life (QoL) (Aliev et al., 2013).
Evidence for multimodal approaches also includes combined training for brain plasticity,
neurogenesis in the hippocampus and a neuroprotective effect on the cerebral cortex
(Garc
ia-Mesa et al., 2011). For example, Curlik and Shors (2013) found that a combination
of physical training followed by successful mental learning was more beneficial for neuronal
recruitment and overall mental health than either activity alone. Furthermore, exercise in
combination with dietary factors can affect molecular events related to the management of
energy metabolism and the synaptic plasticity of cognition according to Gomez-Pinilla
(2011). K
obe et al. (2016) found that omega-3 fatty acid intake combined with aerobic
exercise and CS prevented atrophy in AD-related brain regions in mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) patients.
Given the emergence of multimodal approaches, some reviews have already been con-
ducted. Rodakowski, Saghafi, Butters, and Skidmore (2015) found small improvements in
selected cognitive abilities in early stage dementia from a combination of cognitive and
physical exercise. Law, Barnett, Yau, and Gray (2014) found significant cognitive function
improvement in four out of five studies combining cognitive and exercise training in older
adults with cognitive impairment. However, Rodakowski et al.'s (2015) scoping review
looked at adults with a range of cognitive impairment. Law et al. (2014) looked only at
exercise and CS in adults with and without cognitive impairment. Therefore, it remains to
understand the extant evidence more comprehensively.
Three gaps in the literature have been identified which make this review both timely and
relevant. Firstly, whilst there is growing interest in non-pharmacological interventions for
treating dementia, little is known about the effect of complex interventions in this popula-
tion. Secondly, evidence exists for people with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) and
MCI, but evidence is lacking for measured cognitive outcomes in studies specifically for
people living with dementia. Thirdly, whilst some reviews, such as the two above have been
conducted which look at certain combinations of modalities, a thorough systematic review
of all possible modality combinations has not been conducted. Consequently, this review
Chalfont et al. 3
provides a synthesis of the evidence for multimodal non-pharmacological interventions
(MNPIs) for improving cognitive function for people living with dementia.
Method
Search strategy and screening
A systematic search of peer-reviewed literature was performed on PubMed, PsycINFO,
Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL
and LILACS. Search terms included dementia, Alzheimer's or cognitive impairment and
variations of multimodal, treatment, intervention, activity or programme tailored to each
database (Online Appendix 1). Grey literature was also searched for theses, dissertations,
policy documents and conference proceedings.
Typology development
Multiple terms in the evidence have been used to describe `multimodal' interventions. For
this review, a classification system was required to determine how many modes a study
utilised and hence, whether it was included. Drawing upon the categories of Choi and
Twamley (2013) and Clare and Woods (2004), three initial modes were derived:
1. Cognitive enhancement therapies (CS, CT and CR; non-invasive brain stimulation);
2. Physical interventions (physical exercise, physical and occupational rehabilitation); and
3. Psychological and psychosocial therapies (art, music, dance, cognitive-behavioural ther-
apy (CBT), horticultural therapy (HT), psychotherapy, recreational activities, volunteer-
ing, etc.).
Seven further modes emerged from the title and abstract screening (see Table 1).
Inclusion criteria
All included studies met the following inclusion criteria:
· Involved older people with a primary diagnosis of dementia;
· At least two modes of non-pharmacological intervention;
· Changes in cognitive function was an outcome measure;
· Any study design or setting;
· Studies with mixed participant groups (dementia, MCI, etc.) if subgroup analysis (e.g.,
individuals with dementia) was available;
· English language of any date.
Exclusion criteria
· Specifically addressed delirium, pain, incontinence or behavioural and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD);
· If only two modes addressed and one of these delivered training, knowledge or support to
care staff or family carers;
4 Dementia 0(0)
· One mode was pharmacological treatment. (If participants were taking stable doses of
dementia medication prior to the study it was not excluded.)
(A list of acronyms and abbreviations can be found in Online Appendix 4)
Study selection
Ninety-seven candidate studies were selected at the title/abstract stage by the first author
(GC). The other authors (CM and JS) checked 10% of the studies, discussed and resolved
any disagreements. Figure 1 shows the searching, screening and selection process. The team
consulted on the modes and methods of intervention. Twenty-four papers were initially
included (27 group or case studies) finalising the Typology at 10 modes (Table 1). See
Online Appendix 2 for detailed descriptions of modes and methods.
Included studies are shown in Table 2 with their modes of intervention.
Searching the grey literature revealed increasing public and practitioner interest in the
area of non-pharmacological treatments for dementia, including multimodal approaches.
However, no findings from the grey literature met the inclusion criteria.
Quality appraisal
Given that both qualitative and quantitative studies were eligible for inclusion in the review,
quality appraisal of the peer-reviewed literature utilised the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool
(MMAT), allowing for assessment of qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies
within one measure (Pluye et al., 2011; Souto et al., 2015). A recommended cut-off score of
25% or less excluded lower quality papers from further analysis. At this stage, one paper
was excluded (Jian, 1999) out of 24 reducing the total included papers to 23 (See Online
Appendix 3: Quality Appraisal).

Data synthesis and analysis
The included studies were found to have one predominant characteristic under which they
could be compiled and synthesised. Ten studies in which the intervention mode was pre-
dominantly cognitive (therapies, stimulation, rehabilitation or training) are presented in
Table 3. Ten further studies in which the intervention was predominantly physical (exercise,
occupation, rehabilitation or nutrition) are presented in Table 4. Finally, two case study
papers (with a total of 5 individual case studies) in which the intervention mode was
personalised treatment in a clinical or research setting are shown in Table 5. Study charac-
teristics included author & year; sample, study design, intervention modes and methods,
setting, study length, frequency and time involved.
Participants and settings. Studies were from Korea (4), USA (4), Italy (3), Spain (3),
Brazil (3), Germany (2), China (1), Portugal (1) and Singapore (1). Participant numbers
in the group studies ranged from 14 (Maci et al., 2012) to 206 (Ibarria et al., 2016), with a
mean of 58, and an age range of 54­93. Two case studies reported on five patients with

dementia, aged 54­78 (Bredesen et al., 2016a; Prokopov, 2010). Participants totalled 1,178,
of which 388 in six studies lived in long-term care (nursing home or a psychiatric hospital)
and 790 in 16 studies lived at home, attended a day service or were hospitalised for a period
of weeks. Two studies (Onor et al., 2007; Viola et al., 2011) also enlisted the caregivers as
participants during the intervention.
Pharmacology. Some participant groups were on stable doses of memantine, cholinester-
ase inhibitors and/or antidepressants prior to, and during, the studies although no study
declared participants to be drug-nai¨ve. Individualised treatment programmes that purported
to address the root cause of the dementia symptoms (Bredesen et al., 2016; Prokopov,
2010) prescribed pharmaceutical adjuncts such as bio-identical hormones to address specific
imbalances.
Study designs. Whilst the methodology was designed to be inclusive of qualitative and
mixed methods studies, all studies meeting the inclusion and quality criteria were quantita-
tive in design, but quite heterogeneous. Whilst all carried out pre­post-tests, only 11 (48%)
were RCTs (Quality Appraisal 84%). A further five were non-randomised (QA 100%)
and seven were quantitative descriptive (QA 100%) (see Quality Appraisal in Online
Appendix 3). Han et al. (2017) was the only double-blind or cross-over trial. Three were
conducted across multiple centres: Graessel et al. (2011) and Oswald, Gunzelmann, and
Ackermann (2007) in German nursing homes, and Serda
` i Ferrer and del Valle (2014) in
Spanish day hospitals. For characteristics of all studies, see Tables 3 to 5.
Intervention modes and methods. Li and Li (2017) had no cognitive mode, and Prokopov
(2010) and Vicente de Sousa et al. (2017) had neither cognitive nor physical mode, but all
others had both. Only four lacked a psychological, psychosocial, psychomotor, spiritual,
caregiver or support mode. One used oxygen therapy (Prokopov, 2010) and three addressed
diet and nutrition and/or fasting (Bredesen, 2016; Prokopov, 2010; Vicente de Sousa et al.,
2017). Four studies termed `multicomponent' or `dual-task' combined modes simultaneous-
ly and are shown in Table 4 spanning two columns. Methods utilised within the studies
illustrated the creative variability of the main modes. Cognitive mode (Table 3) included
methods such as therapies, stimulation, rehabilitation and training. Physical mode (Table 4)
included methods such as exercise, occupation, rehabilitation and nutrition. Table 5 eluci-
dates multiple methods found in personalised treatment interventions.
Study duration. The length of group intervention ranged from 20 minutes (Yoon et al.,
2013) to 8 hours (Ibarria et al., 2016). The shortest timeframe was three weeks (Vicente de
Sousa et al., 2017), whereas Arkin (2007) continued a facilitated intervention for up to four
years. Personalised N-of-1 treatments were followed-up through clinic visits for 24 months
(Bredesen et al., 2016).
Stage and type of dementia. Seven studies included participants with mild dementia, 11
with mild to moderate, three with mild, moderate or severe and one with moderate to severe.
Twelve studies included participants with AD whilst 10 included unspecified or mixed types
of dementia. A study by La Rue, Felten, and Turkstra (2015) included 8% (N ¼ 5) of
participants with MCI. The decision was taken to include this study as >90% of partic-
ipants fit the inclusion criteria.
Outcome measures. For cognitive assessment, multiple tools were utilised. Predominantly,
21 studies used the MMSE (English, Korean and Chinese versions), nine used the Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) and fouir used the ADAS-Cog (Cognitive subscale of the
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) or ADAS-K (Korean version). Fourteen other
scales were used once or twice (see Table 6 for details). Of the 21 group studies, 17 (81%)

reported pre­post-test scores using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the
Chinese MMSE or the 7MST (7 Minute Screening Test), and could therefore be included
in an effect size (ES) analysis (Figure 2). Oswald et al. (2007) uniquely included a staff survey
on residents' cognitive change. In the five case studies only three provided pre­post-test
MMSE or similar which hindered comparison of clinical importance (Figure 4). The case
studies in Bredesen et al. (2016) reported over 10 instruments including magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans,
metabolic testing, quantitative neuropsychological testing, genetic testing and a battery of
cognitive tests. Whilst three of these case studies reported pre­post-test MMSE, one (Patient
9) reported the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) instead, which substituted for the
MMSE in the ES analysis. Interestingly, all four group studies that showed clinically impor-
tant differences used MMSE exclusively (Figure 3).
Findings
Eighteen group studies or case studies out of a total of 26 (69%) reported either statistically
significant or meaningful within-group improvements in cognition (Baglio et al., 2015;
Bredesen et al., 2016; Burgener, Yang, Gilbert, & Marsh-Yant, 2008; Christofoletti et al.,
2008; Coelho et al., 2013; Han et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2016; Li & Li, 2017;
Onor et al., 2007; Oswald et al., 2007; Prokopov, 2010; Raggi et al., 2007; Tay, Lim, Chan,
Ali, & Chong, 2016; Yoon et al., 2013). Stability of scores or an attenuation of decline was
reported in six group studies (Arkin, 2007; Graessel et al., 2011; Ibarria et al., 2016; La Rue
et al., 2015; Maci et al., 2012; Viola et al., 2011). Two group studies, Serda

Valle (2014) and Vicente de Sousa et al. (2017) reported no cognitive improvement and
continual decline. Cognitive outcomes are summarised in Table 6.
(1) What is the evidence for what works and does not work (the predictors of efficacy)?
The ES of each intervention group was evaluated. Cohen's ES, d, was used to calculate pre­
post comparisons (Cohen, 1988). In dementia studies the tendency is for cognition in a
control group to decline in the absence of an intervention. Studies that report an ES between
groups at the end of the assessment period may therefore show inflation, in part from the
declining controls, and consequently give a misleading over-estimate of the effect of the
specific treatment or intervention. Therefore, we first chose to examine the within-group ES
(Figure 2) to discern which of the interventions worked, in a calculated score uninflated by
the tendency to deteriorate in the control group. Using accepted criteria (0.2 ­ small, 0.5 ­
medium and 0.8 ­ large) (Cohen, 1988), this analysis indicated that of the 17 studies
suitable for ES, two studies had a large ES (Christofoletti et al., 2008; Li and Li, 2017),
four had a medium ES (Onor et al., 2007; Raggi et al., 2007; Tay et al., 2016; Yoon et al.,
2013) and five had a small ES (Burgener et al., 2008; Graessel et al., 2011; Han et al., 2017;
Ibarria et al., 2016; La Rue et al., 2015). A further six studies showed a negative ES
reflecting the disease course. Interestingly, one study which reported that, based on conven-
tional inferential testing, `global cognition did not improve through treatment' had the
largest ES (d ¼ 0.909) (Christofoletti et al., 2008).
The following four group studies were excluded from this analysis for the following
reasons. Coelho et al. (2013) used the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) which was
designed to assess frontal lobe function and to distinguish frontal lobe dementia from
AD (Slachevsky et al., 2004). Kim et al. (2016) provided a graph showing positive mean
score change. Kang et al. (2010) provided median change scores and Baglio et al. (2015)
provided no measures for within-group analysis.
Of equal importance in interpreting change is the minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) (Burback, Molnar, St John, & Man-Son-Hing, 1999), defined as the smallest
change in an outcome that a clinician would identify as important. The ADAS-Cog is a
70-point scale on which lowered scores indicate improvement. A change of 4 points or more
on the ADAS-Cog scale would define a MCID for mild to moderate dementia (Huntley,
Gould, Liu, Smith, & Howard, 2015). Again, looking specifically at the intervention group
data, two studies reported improvement on the ADAS-Cog (Graessel et al., 2011; Han et al.,
2017) but not clinically important.
The MMSE is a 30-point scale on which a higher score indicates improvement and a
change of at least 3 points is considered clinically important in North America (Burback
et al., 1999; Qaseem et al., 2008). To assess studies with the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in the UK (NICE, 2018) a Minimal Important
Difference (MID) of 1.4 is also evaluated. Accordingly, four group studies (Christofoletti
et al., 2008; Li & Li, 2017; Raggi et al., 2007; Tay et al., 2016) (Figure 3) reported change in
mean MMSE above the NICE threshold of minimal important difference (Figure 3).
However, no intervention group outcomes from the group studies reached an MID of 3
points on the MMSE.
These four, plus two more group studies were identified in the Effect Size analysis
(Figure 2) as having Good or Medium efficacy. Table 7 shows these Top Six studies and
the modes and methods they used.

above the NICE guidance on MID. Both case studies also exceeded a non-UK MID of 3
points. A further case study (Bredesen et al., 2016), Patient 9, reported an MID on the
MoCA which is significantly positively correlated (Stewart, O'Riley, Edelstein, & Gould,
2012) and translatable to the MMSE for comparison (Trzepacz, Hochstetler, Wang,
Walker, & Saykin, 2015). Patient 9 showed clinically important improvement according
to NICE guidance (Figure 4).
Besides the three case studies that used MMSE or MoCA in Figure 4 below, two more
were reported in the included papers (Bredesen et al., 2016; Prokopov, 2010). When pro-
viding personalised N-of-1 treatment, the efficacy of the multimodal interventions was
determined by the clinician through a range of assessment indicators, including MRI,
FDG PET scans, CVLT-IIB and numerous metabolic and neuropsychological tests.
These reported clinically important pre­post-test results for these two patients (Table 8).
These case studies utilised the following modes and methods (Table 9).
(2) Does multimodal matter?
Nine of the 11 studies showing positive cognitive ES (Figure 2) used three modes rather than
two, indicating that more may be better. However, as well as the number of modes, the number
of methods used to carry out the modes is multiple and diverse. For instance, Ibarria et al.
(2016) initiated an Integral Psychostimulation Program (IPP) integrating cognitive, motor and
mood-related rehabilitation and stimulation for cognitive functions. They also used exercise
(active and passive gymnastics, personal & spatial orientation, motor coordination and body
language), music therapy, relaxation, occupational activities to maintain ADLs, expression,
creativity, board games and caregivers involvement. Also, the focus or general character of
the intervention overall (was it largely cognitive or physical?) helped determine the effectiveness
of the cognitive mode. For example, five out of six studies which showed a negative ES were
predominantly physical with other modes in addition. Conversely, 8 of the 11 studies which
showed a positive ES were predominantly cognitive with other modes in addition.
(3) What is the evidence for different groups of people with dementia
(early, mid or late stage)?
Analysis of the cognitive impairment levels of participant groups did not indicate that
interventions necessarily work any better for the least or the most impaired. In the six

papers with the highest ES there was a range of dementia from mild to severe. In fact, the
second best ES was achieved by Li and Li (2017) with a participant group that was 82%
moderate to severe dementia in a nursing home. Arkin (2007) found that most early stage
participants tended to improve or maintain on test scores, but occasionally a person in the
moderate stage did also. Graessel et al. (2011) showed that in nursing homes the ESs for the
intervention were greater in the subgroup of patients (n ¼ 50) with mild to moderate disease.
Raggi et al.'s study (2007) of 30% mild, 40% moderate and 30% severe patients concluded
that subjects in all stages of dementia showed some improvement from attending the treat-
ment programme. Kim et al.'s (2016) study of nursing home residents reported improvement
in moderate to severe AD taking physical exercise (Kohzuki Exercise Program ­ KEP) along
with a multi-component cognitive programme (MCP), (KEP þ MCP).
Predictably, Serda
` i Ferrer and de Valle's (2014) study reported that the magnitude of the
effects of the programme diminished progressively in relation to the stage of the disease.
Indeed, the most significant and continuous reduction occurred in the dimension of patient
cognitive capacity among day hospital patients with mild (29.69%), moderate (31.25%) or
severe (39.06%) dementia. Hence, the staging of dementia among the participants seemed to
have no direct bearing on the ES of the intervention group, but perhaps had more to do
with the level of optimisation of the intervention for participants in different stages of
dementia. Given the available study data, the potential for different types of dementia
was inconclusive.
(4) What are the strengths and limitations of different study designs
used in testing these outcomes?
The most clinically important cognitive differences were achieved in case study designs.
Meanwhile, 7 out of 11 group studies with positive ES had a randomised design, whereby
the mode was not chosen specifically for the individual but for the cohort generally.
However, this did not prove detrimental to the outcomes, as a personalised approach was
also evident in the most effective group interventions. For example, Christofoletti et al.
(2008), Li and Li (2017), Raggi et al. (2007) and Tay et al. (2016) tailored interventions
or individual sessions to the person with dementia, whilst Burgener et al. (2008), Ibarria
et al. (2016), La Rue et al. (2015) and Onor et al. (2007) added components of caregiver
involvement.
In the design of the sessions (minutes per week, # of sessions), a roughly inverse pattern
could be found between time and effectiveness. The time commitment required of

participants in the six most effective studies was 24 weeks or less. Some studies requiring a
greater time commitment were less effective. For example, Graessel et al. (2011) had the

had the greatest total time commitment of 979 hours (approximated, see Table 3). Because

intervention time of eight weeks in Han et al. (2017) they acknowledged that these may have
limited the effect of the Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET). Since they
achieved a small ES for the dementia subgroup, perhaps the overall ES was only hindered by
the study duration, and that a longer study might have been more efficacious.
Analysis of the settings found that three of the top four most effective studies were
carried out in nursing homes or a long-term care hospital, whereas 83% of the studies
with a negative ES were carried out in a day care, day hospital, university facility or research
centre with people who attended for sessions but lived at home. One further point about
study design, Serda
` i Ferrer and de Valle's (2014) study suggested a mixed method design
may be more appropriate for older participants lacking high levels of literacy.
(5) What are the strengths and limitations of outcome measures?
Choice of outcome measures varied across studies (see Table 1) which possibly facilitated
statistically significant findings. Also, some screening tests, such as the MMSE have well-
reported weaknesses (Stewart et al., 2012; Verma et al., 2015). However, there was a value to
using well-recognised instruments as it facilitated at least some quantitative analyses
(Figures 2 to 4). The studies were largely heterogeneous and the requirements for individual
studies varied depending on the intervention tested. Therefore, conclusions on the relative
merits of different measures were not possible and further work is needed specific to mul-
tifactorial studies.

(6) What is the evidence for theory on the likely process of change
for each mode of intervention?
Of the 10 modes utilised in the studies, other than those modes highlighted in the
Introduction (i.e. exercise, especially high-intensity exercise, CS and nutrition), evidence is
lacking for primary studies correlating efficacy of these various modes to improved cogni-
tion for people with dementia. However, Alzheimer's disease has been shown to involve
multiple pathophysiological factors for which physical, mental activities and exercises nor-
malise and regulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) (Aliev et al., 2013) and promote the produc-
tion of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which correlates with neuroplasticity in
the hippocampus (Colcombe et al., 2006; Erickson et al., 2011). Aerobic exercise in partic-
ular is associated with increased neurogenesis and angiogenesis, as well as the production of
BDNF and other growth factors involved in neuroprotection such as the promotion of cell
survival, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity (Cramer et al., 2011) and protecting
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from oxidative damage and rejuvenating the mitochondria
(Garatachea et al., 2015). Cognitive activity has increased neuronal plasticity and cognitive
reserve, a lack of which hastens cognitive decline in dementia (Panerai, 2016). `The changes
we saw in fMRI support the notion that even the AD brain still has plasticity resources and
can react to positive environmental stimuli,' said Baglio et al. (2015).
Stress relief, meditation and relaxation lowered cortisol, decreased inflammation and
increased BDNF. The effect of meditation caused significant changes in CBF (Khalsa,
Amen, Hanks, Money, & Newberg, 2009). Neurotoxins such as heavy metals and mould
have been associated with cognitive decline and subsequently removed through detoxifica-
tion with for instance sauna or chelation (Bredesen, 2016; Shoemaker & House, 2006).
Hormone balancing optimises thyroid function and regulates sex hormones. Sleep disturban-
ces and disorders may disrupt neuronal pathways, impair working memory, lead to cogni-
tive impairment and are a significant risk factor for dementia (Miller, 2015).
Because DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs are the principal
epigenetic mechanisms involved in AD pathophysiology, some argue that nutrition can
prevent the onset of dementia and attenuate cognitive decline, especially if combined with
brain exercise and physical training (Athanasopoulos et al., 2016). Dietary factors can com-
plement the action of exercise at the cellular level of energy metabolism and synaptic plas-
ticity (Gomez-Pinilla, 2011). Given the growing evidence base on the process of change for
the above interventions, multimodal approaches that target several dysfunctions simulta-
neously, and that emphasize nutritional, botanical and stimulatory therapies may offer the
most benefit (Wollen, 2010).
(7) What are the strengths and limitations of different evaluation tools used
to assess the effectiveness of MNPIs on improving cognitive functioning?
In Kim et al. (2016), nursing home participants with moderate-severe AD did not improve
significantly after six months in the KEP þ MCP group compared to the MCP group on the
MMSE and CDT. However, the ADAS-Cog score showed significant improvement at the
same time point, which may relate to its greater sensitivity to detect change. The MMSE is
widely criticised for this relative lack of ability. Indeed, Ibarria et al. (2016) also reported
cognition as stable on the MMSE but slightly declined on the ADAS-Cog. Two studies used
34 Dementia 0(0)
the FAB (possible score 18, higher indicates improvement). With so much heterogeneity
among the studies the strengths and limitations of different tools are unclear.
(8) What is the effectiveness of different modes of delivery on the effectiveness of
MNPIs for improving cognitive functioning for people with a diagnosis of dementia?
Different modes may take more time to register an effect than others. For example, Vicente
de Sousa et al. (2017) investigated a nutritional supplementation psychomotor rehabilitation
programme (NSPRG) lasting 21 days. But cognitive benefit might require a longer inter-
vention, as evidenced by the improved test scores found in 91% (N ¼ ?) of analysed studies
in this review, all of which exceeded 21 days. Some of the most effective group studies
included individualised aspects to their interventions.
Christofoletti et al. (2008) (d ¼ 0.909) provided tailored physiotherapeutic sessions con-
centrating on specific kinesiotherapeutic exercises that stimulated strength, balance and
cognition. This study observed an attenuation of cognitive decline, in particular verbal
fluency and executive function. Li and Li (2017) (d ¼ 0.497) provided 30-minute individual
sessions twice a week according to their likes and preference, such as singing practice of
favourite folk songs. Tay et al. (2016) (d ¼ 0.457) gave tailored individualised 30-minute
activities. A further personalised approach was found in Raggi et al. (2007) (d ¼ 0.245)
which illustrated a comprehensive rehabilitation programme in a specialised hospital unit.
Although the study lasted 17 months overall, the mean stay in the hospital was only 26 days,
beginning with a thorough investigation including neurological examination and laboratory
analyses to inform each person's integrated, supportive and individualised treatment.
In summary, this review found multimodal intervention research predominantly in Spain,
Portugal, USA, Italy and Asia. Group studies commonly utilised 2­3 modes and occurred in
long-term care, day care, clinic, hospital, university facilities or in the community. A very
small number of case studies were found, utilising up to nine modes. Study duration varied
from three weeks to four years and sessions lasted from 20 minutes to 8 hours. Time com-
mitment required of participants in the six most effective studies was 24 weeks or less.
People with all stages of dementia participated and studies occasionally involved caregivers.
Discussion and implications
The results of this review have important implications for dementia treatments, as 92% (24/
26) of included studies demonstrated statistical improvement, stability or attenuation of
decline. Studies that personalised the multimodal approach by identifying individual
needs of participants or patients and tailoring interventions accordingly, resulted in the
greatest ESs. These findings should encourage extensive research of complex multimodal
interventions for dementia, including cognitive, physical or psychological therapies along-
side novel ones such as brain stimulation (Raggi, Tasca, & Ferri, 2017), oxygen therapy,
detoxification, stress reduction, sleep hygiene, hormonal health, fasting and nutrition. Some
considerations have emerged:
Length of study. A multimodal or `complex' intervention contains interacting components
requiring specific design guidance (Craig et al., 2013). One difficulty in designing multimodal
interventions is accounting for the varying timeframes within which different effects may
impact individuals. Because the shortest study (Vicente) had one of the smallest ESs and
Chalfont et al. 35
four of the longest studies showed maintenance of cognition, we investigated whether study
length was an indicator of ES. We found that the length of intervention was not an indicator
of effectiveness as evidenced by the results of Raggi, Han, Tay, Li and Li and Kang, all of
which lasted four months of less. As Vicente was predominantly a nutritional intervention,
which also assessed the effect on cognition, it is not surprising that a short study length
would have proved unproductive cognitively. Similarly, in the case of Onor et al. (2007),
there was a `lack of improvement of cognitive function . . . probably due to the short dura-
tion of the rehabilitation program' (p. 268).
Effect size versus benefit. Reviewing multimodal studies by looking at a measurable gain in
only one mode such as cognition, can lead to erroneous assumptions about the success of the
research and indeed the benefits of the intervention for the participants with dementia. An
example of this is Arkin's study (2007), which scored lowest on ES of the intervention groups.
In spite of this, maintenance of function, or improvement on several discourse measures, was
achieved by the programme's 11 first-year participants. This study was also successful in
reducing the annual rate of decline between 3rd and 4th year to just 1 point, which was
significantly less than the CERAD comparator group. Therefore, a small amount of decline
can be a benefit when compared to rapid decline in the untreated population.
Holistic approach. Since dementia is multifactorial in terms of the numerous risk factors
involved, then a holistic approach to treatment would perhaps stand the best chance of
addressing a range of symptoms. This is the premise for multimodal interventions, at least as
they are currently designed, which cannot be unpacked to determine which element helped
to delay or reverse cognitive decline. Positive emotions, enjoyment, creativity, belief, even
spirituality can contribute to cognition as much as exercise and diet for example. Onor et al.
(2007) reported that socialization itself can lead to improvements, and `programs that take a
more holistic approach to the individual are more effective than those focusing on cognitive
rehabilitation alone' (p. 270). Maci et al. (2012) echoed this with their integrated approach
of CS, physical activity and socialisation to slow down affective decline and reduce
carer burden.
Assessment tools. Judging from the multiple tools that have been reported one might
jump to the conclusion that many tests are administered in hopes of finding positive out-
comes to report. However, multimodal studies require numerous tests ­ a complete battery
for each mode. This enables more insight into the various ways the intervention might be
helping to improve cognition. But testing can also contribute to participant burden and
might even encourage drop-outs. There is thus a pressing need in multimodal research to
analyse the strengths and limitations of different evaluation tools.
Recently, Webster et al. (2017) found that cognitive measures such as the MMSE can be
distressing and demoralising for people with dementia and their carers who preferred that
cognition should be taken in context of previous ability. It was felt that `a larger package of
specific measures would give a holistic view of an individual and include more detail' (p. 13)
and that timed measures which estimate cognitive processing speed should be considered,
along with the recommended validated measures of MMSE and ADAS-Cog. In keeping
with this, studies reported a range of testing including CSF biomarkers, blood work, met-
abolic analysis as well as in-depth narrative assessment. One paper (Oswald et al., 2007)
included data from another informant, a questionnaire for nursing staff on the changes in
cognitive and functional ability of residents.
For future studies the use of a range of testing relevant to the population sample
is recommended, as well as a standardised, free and widely available instrument for
36 Dementia 0(0)
pre­post-test assessment. For instance, the CDR global score has been recommended as a
staging or impression of change outcome measure in future studies (Webster et al., 2017).
The Short Cognitive Test (SKT) has also been known to be `more sensitive to subtle
changes' than the MMSE as it is a `more comprehensive cognitive assessment battery and
takes account processing speed and response accuracy' (Viola et al., 2011).
Study design ­ Pharmacology and the Naturalistic. Although this review searched for,
selected and focused on non-pharmacological approaches, the advent of disease-modifying
drug treatments is near for preclinical and prodromal stages as disease models improve their
ability to predict the likely course of dementia (Ritchie et al., 2017). Drug-nai¨ve patients
with a diagnosis of dementia are practically non-existent as this review discovered.
Therefore, the opportunity arises for collaborative interventions that combine and integrate
pharmacology with non-pharmacological treatments as shown in Ibarria et al. (2016). So-
called `naturalistic' studies, which follow a group of patients in an outpatient clinic over
many months are relevant and informative to clinical practice. Bragin et al. (2012) showed
arrest in cognitive decline for 60 months for patients with depression, dementia, physical
disability and medical illnesses. Patients were treated with a multimodal intervention specific
to their needs, including anti-depressants, cholinesterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor antagonists, vitamins and supplements as well as physical and cognitive
exercises. This example strengthens the evidence base, informs clinical practice and is rele-
vant to people living with dementia who (1) would routinely be prescribed a dementia drug,
and (2) often have comorbidities. Such a patient consequently may benefit from a combined,
integrative treatment model, as Bragin et al. (2012) aptly demonstrated.
Terminology. Because innumerable descriptive terms for utilising more than one mode
pervaded the intervention literature, an added benefit of this review was to develop the
typology described herein. The Typology of Modes and Methods for Dementia
Interventions (Online Appendix 2) organises them into a comprehensive and logical struc-
ture. This typology enables a systematic evaluation of where a study sits relevant to the
extant literature. It also facilitates multidisciplinary comparison of studies as different fields
have their own ways of describing modes of interventions. This typology can help to classify
research involving multimodal, multicomponent, dual-task, integrative, combined or com-
plex interventions.
Involving people with dementia. There are opportunities in research design and implemen-
tation to include participants in a meaningful way. Perhaps one of the reasons why N-of-1
interventions worked so well is the involvement of the patient, particularly by helping to
formulate and then agree the treatment approach with the practitioner or researcher. This
goes beyond mere consent to participate and freedom to withdraw. This is about collabo-
rative engagement ­ co-ownership throughout the process. Another paper by Tay et al.
(2016) went into more depth about their goal-oriented approach (Chew, Chong, Fong, &
Tay, 2015). Cognition goals as well as goals to improve engagement and socialization;
reduce caregiver stress; and improve physical function, behaviour and mood were set and
61.8% of participants met them.
Diversity of needs. Groups are complicated by the diversity of needs within them. Serda
` i
Ferrer and del Valle (2014) found, on the one hand, that advanced age, diverse symptoms,
the stage of the disease and the impracticalities of working with a group led to significant
and continuous reduction in patient cognitive status. On the other hand, they noted that the
improvement in QoL was `decisive and groundbreaking', suggesting that `psychological
factors may have helped mediate the relationship between exercise and QoL' (p. 197).
Chalfont et al. 37
Personalised approach. It is a commonly held belief across the lay population and main-
stream media that no disease-modifying treatments for dementia exist (Webster et al., 2017).
We have now shown that optimised and targeted interventions can help to address the
underlying causes of cognitive decline. The role of neurotoxins, nutritional deficiencies,
inflammation and the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative disease (Bland, 2016) can
lead to a personalised care plan and enhanced precision of treatment decisions (Galvin,
2017). Moreover, a person's dementia has a unique etiology which must be understood
individually to develop personalized treatment (Pomorska & Ockene, 2017). Likewise,
effort must also be taken to add some component of support for individuals in research
studies. Should personalised treatments for individuals become more widespread, the learn-
ing and application can benefit research as well as patients and residents in long term care
(Bodai et al., 2018).
Limitations
The wide diversity of nomenclature in multimodal studies means our search strategy may
not be as comprehensive or successful as intended. Interventions not described in-depth may
have led to erroneous categorisation. Decisions about which assessment measures to include
in order to maintain consistency but also to include as many studies as possible may have
weakened our conclusions. Lack of response from some authors meant we had to omit some
studies from the computational analyses.
Conclusion
Overall, there is some evidence that MNPIs can improve cognitive function in adults with a
primary diagnosis of dementia by addressing multiple modifiable risk factors currently
understood to contribute towards cognitive decline. In cases where cognitive outcomes
were improved, the following seven research components tended to be in place:
1. At least three modes were utilised and the methods for implementing the modes were
multiple and diverse;
2. The general character or focus of the intervention was on cognitive therapies, stimulation,
training or rehabilitation, augmented with other modes such as physical, psychosocial,
nutritional, etc.;
3. A personalised one-to-one interaction specific to each individual was included which
involved engagement, investigation and assessment helping to focus or fine-tune their
intervention;
4. Social, logistical or practical support involved caregivers or students, or a general wid-
ening of social networks;
5. The degree of a person's cognitive impairment was not seen as an impediment to inter-
vention but rather was optimised for those with moderate to severe impairment to max-
imise potential benefits;
6. Study design and outcome measures allowed for the generation of measurable improve-
ment and the timely and meaningful data capture of the results;
7. Interventions leveraged recent advances in our understanding of the underlying causes of
dementia and ways to disrupt these neurodegenerative mechanisms through nutrition,
fasting, oxygen therapies, stress reduction, sleep hygiene and so on.
38 Dementia 0(0)
The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of MNPIs for improving cog-
nition in people with a dementia diagnosis. As research increases in this area, healthcare
practitioners will be more able to treat people with cognitive impairment in ways that help to
reduce the symptoms and slow the decline by addressing the underlying causes of dementia.
Health and social care providers need to be better informed about lifestyle medicine as an
adjunct to existing pharmacotherapies in order to improve choices for their patients and
service users. It is socially and economically imperative that practice does not fall behind
emerging evidence. Current relevant findings on effective treatments may empower
and encourage people with dementia and their carers towards personal health through
self-care, whilst directing and stimulating research that continually improves clinical under-
standing and therefore patient outcomes.
