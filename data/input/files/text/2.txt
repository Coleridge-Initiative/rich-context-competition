 Generational Replacement and Value Change in
 Six West European Societies *

 Paul R. Abramson, Michigan State University
 Ronald Inglehart, University ofMichigan

 Generational replacement has had a major impact on the distribution of materialist/post-
 materialist values among Western publics. Between 1970 and 1984 the ratio of post-material-
 ists to materialists increased substantially in West Germany, Britain, and The Netherlands,
 and increased somewhat in France. In Belgium and Italy materialist values increased as a result
 of short-term forces conducive to materialism. In Germany, Britain, and The Netherlands
 population replacement contributed to the rise of post-materialism. In France, it reversed
 short-term forces contributing to materialism, while in Belgium and Italy population replace-
 ment partially offset short-term forces that contributed to materialist values. Analysis of the
 impact of generational replacement sheds light on the development of value orientations in
 Western societies and on a process through which attitude change occurs among mass publics.

 Are the social priorities of Western publics changing? A 1970 survey of
 political values in six West European societies demonstrated that young
 Europeans had strikingly different values than their elders (see Inglehart,
 1971). When asked to choose among competing goals, older Europeans
 tended to select such "materialist" values as maintaining order and fighting
 inflation, while younger Europeans were more likely to give top priority to
 such "post-materialist" goals as belonging and self-expression. Subsequent
 research found similar age-related differences in America, as well as in
 numerous other countries, and demonstrated that these differences have
 persisted over time (see Inglehart, 1977, pp. 31-38; 198 1).

 The type of values one emphasizes is strongly related to one's political
 behavior and policy preferences. For example, respondents who choose post-

 materialist values are relatively more likely to be politically active in conven-
 tional politics as well as to approve of and to engage in unconventional
 political protest (see Inglehart, 1979a). Post-materialists are also more likely
 to be concerned about the environment, to de-emphasize economic growth,
 and to support the women's movement, the environmentalist movement (see
 Dalton, 1984a), and the peace movement (see Inglehart, 1984a). And even
 though post-materialists are likely to have higher socioeconomic status than
 materialists, they are disproportionately likely to support leftist parties-
 weakening the usual linkage between socioeconomic status and party sup-
 port. In West Germany, both the left wing of the Social Democratic Party and
 the new Green Party are largely based on a post-materialist constituency (see
 Biirklin, 1984, and Miiller-Rommel, 1984), as are the New Left parties in The
 Netherlands. In the United States as well, the New Left clearly has post-
 materialist values (see Miller and Levitin, 1976, pp. 177-78). These changes
 have helped bifurcate the Left in both the United States and Western Europe
 (see Lipset, 1981, pp. 510-21). If age-related differences in values reflect a
 trend, they may be reshaping the politics of Western societies.)

 This article demonstrates the impact of population replacement pro-
 cesses upon aggregate value change. Given that older, more materialist
 Europeans are dying off and that they are replaced continuously by younger,
 less materialist Europeans, generational replacement tends to produce a
 gradual decline in the proportion of materialists and a gradual growth in the
 proportion of post-materialists. Because replacement is a gradual process, it
 takes about a decade for its impact to be clearly discernible in surveys of the
 general population. Moreover, values can change among adults, and short-
 term forces can prevent post-materialism from rising, despite generational
 replacement. Indeed, the trend toward post-materialism during the 1970s
 was inhibited (see Inglehart, 1981), mainly because economic adversity
 stimulated materialist concerns.

 Now, however, we have comparable data for six West European soci-
 eties over a 14-year period.2 As we shall demonstrate, generational replace-

 have Danish and Irish data from 1973 onward, and plan a comparable analysis of value change
 in these societies in future analyses. In addition, the University of Michigan SRC-CPS included
 items measuring these national priorities in the 1972, 1976, and 1980 National Election
 Studies, and these items have also been included in the 1984 National Election Study.

 ment has had a major impact on value trends in all six societies. In Ger-
 many, Britain, and The Netherlands replacement pushed post-materialism
 upward. In France, replacement reversed short-term forces contributing to
 materialism, while in Belgium and Italy replacement partially offset short-
 term forces contributing to materialism.

 By examining generational replacement, we will shed light on a process
 through which attitude change occurs among mass publics. This analysis of
 replacement effects should not be confused with cohort analyses designed to
 explain the reasons for age-group differences in political values or attitudes.
 Cohort analysis can be used to distinguish among aging effects, birth-cohort
 effects, and period effects, something that this analysis does not attempt.
 What this analysis does do is estimate the impact of population replacement
 upon the overall distribution of values among given populations during a
 specific time period. This is an important task, since replacement was a
 major force promoting value change.

 Value Change between 1970 and 1984

 Our data source is a series of 1 14 national surveys sponsored by the
 Commission of the European Communities between 1970 and 1984 in West
 Germany, Britain, The Netherlands, France, Belgium, and Italy.3

 The basic items used to measure value priorities have been widely
 reported in previous publications and are also available in ICPSR code-
 books. Respondents are asked to select what they believe their country's two
 top goals should be among the following four choices:

 1. maintaining order in the nation;
 2. giving the people more say in important government decisions;
 3. fighting rising prices;
 4. protecting freedom of speech.

 Given two choices among four goals, six combinations are possible. Respon-
 dents who select "maintaining order" and "fighting rising prices" are classi-
 fied as materialists, while those who choose "giving the people more say"
 and "freedom of speech" are classified as post-materialists. The four re-
 maining combinations-all of which are made up of one materialist and one
 post-materialist response-are classified as "mixed."4

 3We combine the results for 1970 and 1971 in order to utilize the cohort results presented
 in Inglehart (1977, Table 2- 1, p. 32). For all subsequent reports we present results according to
 single years. For 1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1984 we combined results of two
 surveys.

 4There have been extensive discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of this measure

 (see many of the sources cited in note 1). We recognize that a larger battery of indicators
 provides more accurate measurement than the 4-choice battery used here (see Inglehart, 1977,
 1979b, 1985a). Unfortunately, the 12-choice battery that yields better measurement has been

 Table 1 presents the distribution of value types for each of the six
 countries we studied. It also presents a percentage difference index (PDI)
 computed by subtracting the percentage of materialists from the percentage
 of post-materialists, thus yielding a measure that is equivalent to a mean
 score.5

 Table 1 shows that in Germany, Britain, and The Netherlands the

 percentage of post-materialists has risen somewhat, while the percentage of
 materialists has dropped markedly. The net effect of these changes is
 reflected in our value index, which shows that the overall ratio of post-
 materialists to materialists has increased. In France there was virtually no
 change in the percentage of post-materialists, but there was a small decline
 in the percentage of materialists and, as a result, the iridex score registered a
 small increase. In Belgium and Italy, on the other hand, there was a small
 decrease in the percentage of post-materialists, but a larger increase in the
 proportion of materialists. The net decrease in the ratio of post-materialists
 to materialists is clearly illustrated by our index, although after 1980
 post-materialism in Italy began to rise. In all six countries there are year-to-
 year fluctuations in value priorities.

 The pattern of change over the past 14 years cannot result from replace-

 ment alone, since replacement exerts a continuous pressure pushing post-
 materialism upward. Some of the year-to-year fluctuations, of course, result
 from sampling error. Even for probability samples of this size, a 4 percent-
 age point difference between two samples would be necessary to be reason-
 ably confident that the difference did not result from sampling error (see
 Kish, 1965, p. 580), and given that quota procedures were used in these
 samples, a difference of at least 6 percentage points is probably needed.
 Moreover, our value index is based upon a difference between two percent-
 ages and ranges from -100 to + 100. But it is clear that these year-to-year
 changes are not simply the result of sampling error, for aggregate-level
 changes in responses to these items are strongly related to changes in the
 consumer price index. Though respondents are asked to choose long-term
 goals, they are more likely to select "fighting rising prices" when inflation
 rates are rising. As has been shown elsewhere (see Abramson and Inglehart,
 1984, and Inglehart, 1985b), in all six countries there is a substantial
 correlation between annual changes in the consumer price index and chang-
 ing scores on our value index. Of course, factors other than inflation may
 also affect short-term values. High unemployment may promote economic

 used in all six countries only in two years, 1973 and 1978. The 4-choice indicator is the only
 measure that can be used to examine the effects of generational replacement.

 5 More specifically, the percentage difference index is equivalent to a mean that assigns
 each post-materialist a score of 100, each respondent with mixed values a score of 0, and each
 materialist a score of- 100.

 insecurity, political terrorism may increase concern with maintaining
 order, and some political events may stimulate post-materialist values. But
 our analyses indicate that changes in inflation have far greater effect than
 other short-term factors.

 One would expect respondents to be affected by changing economic
 conditions. The basic thesis about the development of materialist/post-
 materialist values (see Inglehart, 1971, 1977) is that value priorities are
 shaped by social and economic conditions, and that post-materialist val-
 ues develop when conditions of long-term economic security enable peo-
 ple to emphasize higher-order values. But we also expect people to respond
 to current economic conditions, since values themselves may respond to
 short-term changes, and since our measure of these values, which contains
 a "fighting rising prices" option, is sensitive to changing inflation rates.
 But changing short-term conditions should not obscure the fact that
 longer-term changes have also occurred. Indeed, even though there are
 year-to-year fluctuations, the overall distribution of values is continuously
 affected by generational replacement, and our goal in this article is to
 estimate that impact.

 Generational Replacement between 1970 and 1984

 To establish how much replacement took place during these years, we
 turned to national census data reporting the actual number of persons by
 single year of age.6 From these census results we computed the number of
 adults in each of the cohort categories we use in our analysis of the European
 Community Surveys. We have elsewhere presented (see Abramson and
 Inglehart, 1985, Table A 1) the distribution ofthe adult population in each of
 these countries at the end of 1970 and the end of 1984.

 The overall pattern of generational replacement is basically similar in

 all six societies. The proportion of adults born before 1906 dropped dramat-
 ically over the 14 years, falling from a sixth of the adult population in
 Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium to less than 1 adult in
 20. In The Netherlands and Italy, the cohort born before 1906 made up a
 seventh ofthe adult population in 1970, but less than 1 adult in 25 by the end
 of 1984. Even the broadly defined cohort born before the end of World War
 II diminished markedly. For example, in 1970 83 percent of the German
 adults were born before 1946, but by the end of 1984 only 57 percent were.

 6For our 1970 French results we relied upon Institut National de la Statistique et des
 Etudes E-conomiques (1973, Table III), and for the five other countries we used Statistical
 Office of the European Communities (1977, Table 1.lC). For our 1984 results for all six
 countries we used Statistical Office of the European Communities (1984, Table 4 for each
 country). For details about the procedures for our calculations, see Abramson and Inglehart
 (1985, Table Al).

 Similar changes occurred in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy. In
 The Netherlands, the cohort born before 1946 made up 76 percent of the
 adult population in 1970, but only half (49.7 percent) by the end of 1984,
 and the pattern in France is basically similar.

 Cohorts born after 1955 were not part of the adult population in 1970.
 By 1984 these cohorts made up 27 percent of the adult population in
 Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Italy and 30 percent
 in The Netherlands. Over a fourth of the adult population had been replaced
 in all six societies.

 Over the course of these years there is clearly enough generational
 replacement to affect the aggregate distribution of values. It is crucial for
 our analysis that this replacement be reflected in the surveys we employ,
 and, not surprisingly, it is. In Abramson and Inglehart (1984, Tables A2
 through A7) we presented the distribution of respondents by years of birth
 from 1970-71 through 1983; the results for 1984 are presented in Abramson
 and Inglehart (1985, Table A3). As we showed, the 1970-71 surveys some-
 what undersampled the youngest cohort, but the overall rate of replacement
 in our surveys closely paralleled the change revealed by census statistics.

 Value Change through the Life Cycle

 The value scores for the seven basic ten-year cohorts we studied between
 1970-71 and 1983 have been published elsewhere,7 and Table 2 updates
 these results by presenting the value preferences for each country for each of
 the five ten-year cohorts we studied in 1984.8 In all six countries in all 11
 survey years the younger cohorts tend to be more post-materialist than their
 elders, while materialist values are more prevalent among older cohorts.

 Age-group differences in political attitudes can result from differences
 between the position of younger and older adults in the life cycle, from
 differences between the formative socialization of young adults and that of

 7Value scores for 1970-71 can be computed from Inglehart (1977, Table 2-1, p. 32).
 Results for 1973 through 1983 have been presented in graphic form in Inglehart (1985b).
 (These graphs also include the results of the spring 1984 surveys, but not the combined spring
 and fall surveys we use in this article.) We realize that these graphs cannot be used to derive the
 precise cohort values we used to estimate replacement effects. The full cohort matrices through
 1983, however, are available in a paper we presented at the 1984 annual meeting of the
 American Political Science Association (Abramson and Inglehart, 1984). Copies of that paper
 are available from us, as well as from University Microfilms.

 8Differential death rates can lead to problems in tracking cohorts when they reach old age

 since post-materialists (who have higher levels of education and income) tend to live longer than
 materialists. As their social composition changes oldercohorts can become more post-materialist.
 Our analysis of educational levels among cohorts as they age suggests that by 1983 differential
 death rates were affecting the composition of the 1906-15 cohort, and in our analysis of replace-
 ment effects we do not use the results for this cohort after 1982.

 their elders, or from some combination of these two effects. There has been
 considerable controversy over the reason for the relatively high levels of
 post-materialism among young adults (see, for example, Dalton, 1977,
 1981; Jagodzinski, 1983; Van Deth, 1983b; and B6ltken and Jagodzinski,
 1985). In our view the bulk of the evidence clearly suggests that age-group
 differences result from differences between the formative socialization
 experiences of young adults and those of their elders (see Inglehart, 1977,
 1981, 1983, 1985a, 1985b).

 In this article we do not attempt to resolve the controversy over the

 reason for age-group differences in political attitudes. Regardless of the
 reason for these differences in values, it is a biological reality that young
 adults tend to outlive their elders. Except in societies with massive emigra-
 tion and/or immigration, population change is basically the result of genera-
 tional replacement. As these European cohorts age, they may change their
 values, and the way values change among birth cohorts as they move through
 the life cycle directly will determine the effects of replacement upon the net
 distribution of values. If cohorts do not become more materialist as they
 age, replacement will lead to rising levels of post-materialism, regardless of
 the reason they do not move toward materialism. On the other hand, if
 cohorts become more materialist with age, this change will tend to offset the
 effects of replacement. Despite replacement, the population may fail to
 become more post-materialist over time, and may even move toward mate-
 rialism. Even if age-group differences in values were purely the result of
 life-cycle effects, replacement would still affect the overall distribution of
 values for these societies. Obviously, it is important to understand why

 cohorts have different values, especially if one is attempting to make infer-
 ences about future change. In this article, we do not try to disentangle the
 causes of age-group differences, since our goal is to estimate the net impact
 of replacement upon aggregate patterns of change during the recent past.

 Given this goal we will briefly summarize the major changes in cohort

 values over the past 14 years that bear upon our conclusions:

 1. While there is considerable year-to-year variation in value scores

 (much of which results from sampling error), in all six countries cohorts do
 tend to become more materialist over time between 1970-71 and 1980. As
 of 1981, in all countries except Britain, most of the five cohorts (born
 between 1906 and 1955) that can be meaningfully tracked through this
 decade, were more materialist than they had been back in 1970-71. In
 Britain, cohorts had close to the same values in 1981 as they had when our
 time series began.

 2. In the three most recent years cohorts have become more post-

 materialist over time in all countries except Belgium.

 3. In Germany, Britain, and The Netherlands all four cohorts that can
 be meaningfully tracked over the full 14 years between 1970-71 and 1984
 (those born between 1916 and 1955) were more post-materialist in 1984
 than they had been in 1970-71.

 4. In France, three of these four cohorts were somewhat more material-

 ist in 1984 than they had been in 1970-7 1.

 5. In Belgium and Italy all four cohorts were more materialist in 1984

 than they had been in 1970-71.

 While we attribute these cross-national differences to period effects
 (see Inglehart, 1985b), this interpretation is not essential to our conclu-
 sions in this article. Regardless of the reasons for these age-value relation-
 ships, these changes lead to clear expectations about the effects of replace-
 ment. Since cohorts did not become more materialist in Germany, Britain,
 and The Netherlands, we expect replacement to lead to growing levels of
 post-materialism. Since there was only a slight decline in post-materialism
 in France, we would expect replacement to contribute to a near equi-
 librium in overall levels of post-materialism. On the other hand, since
 materialism clearly rises with age in Belgium and Italy, we would not
 expect replacement to push post-materialism upward, although, as we
 shall see, replacement affects the overall distribution of values in both
 these societies.

 The Effects of Generational Replacement upon Value Change

 To estimate the impact of generational replacement, we can create
 algebraically a population in which no replacement occurs (see Abramson,
 1983, pp. 56-61). The first step in creating this hypothetical population is to

 remove new cohorts from the calculations. Artificially eliminating younger
 cohorts that reached adulthood after 1970-71 is a major step, but it does not
 take into account the differential death rates among the older cohorts. To
 estimate the impact of death rates, we must algebraically immortalize the
 older cohorts. To do this, we use the distribution of respondents in each
 cohort in 1970-71 as our base, multiply value scores for each cohort in
 subsequent surveys by the number of respondents in that cohort in 1970-71,
 sum these products, and divide the sum of these products by the total
 number of cases in 1970-71.9 This estimate with the effects of replacement
 removed can then be compared with the actual result. Differences between
 the actual result and the estimated result with the effects of replacement
 removed can be attributed to replacement.

 While we attribute the differences between the actual result and the
 estimated result to replacement, it is important to consider the factors that
 might influence our estimates.

 First, much of the difference between the actual trend and the estimated
 trend results from excluding respondents born after 1955 from the estimated
 values. Younger cohorts tend to respond somewhat more to short-term forces
 than older cohorts do. Thus, when short-term forces contribute to material-
 ism, the young cohorts may differ less from their elders, and the gap between
 the actual and the estimated result will be reduced. On the other hand, if
 short-term forces contribute to post-materialism, young cohorts will tend to
 differ more from their elders. Under such conditions, the differences be-
 tween the actual result and the estimated result will tend to increase. Of
 course, these differences tween can still be attributed to generational replace-
 ment. It is important to recognize, however, that the extent of replacement
 effects will be influenced by short-term forces.

 Second, while we can algebraically immortalize the older cohorts that
 leave the electorate through death, we have no way to know how these
 cohorts would have responded to short-term forces if they had been alive.
 While our assumptions are fairly conservative (see note 10), alternative
 assumptions will yield somewhat different estimates.

 Third, since we have immortalized the cohorts born before 1956, the

 age of our imaginary population is increasing. But, given the large size of the
 1956-65 cohort, the mean age of the actual adult population is decreasing
 somewhat. Thus, one could argue that to some extent the difference between
 the actual result and the estimated result with no replacement includes a
 life-cycle effect. Alternatively, one could interpret this difference as result-
 ing from the differential size of political generations.

 'For a detailed example of a concrete application of this procedure, see Abramson (1983,

 p. 61, note 14).

 These ambiguities largely involve questions of definition. The gap
 between the observed and estimated trend does result from replacement,
 but it does not result only from generational differences in the formative
 socialization experiences of the cohorts entering the adult population and
 those leaving it. Clearly, this gap captures some short-term forces as well.

 Generational replacement can lead to six different outcomes (see Abram-

 son, 1983, pp. 62-64). One outcome is for replacement to have no effect.
 Given the observed relationships between age and values, however, replace-
 ment must have an effect since our precedures remove the youngest cohort,
 which always has a relatively high score on our index, and increases the size of
 older cohorts with relatively low scores. Nonetheless, replacement can have all
 five ofthe remaining effects. Whenever we find an actual increase in material-
 ism (that is to say, there is a decline on the value index), the estimated result
 with replacement effects removed will show a greater decline. Replacement
 must be impeding the trend toward materialism, although the extent of that
 effect is still a matter for empirical investigation. If we find no change in the
 value index over time, the estimated result with replacement effects removed
 must be for materialism to increase. Replacement must be preventing a trend
 toward materialism. On the other hand, if post-materialism rises over time,
 three different results can obtain once we remove the effects of replacement.
 After the effects of replacement are removed, there may be a decline in the
 value scores. In such a case, replacement must be reversing a trend toward
 materialism. When replacement effects are removed, post-materialism may
 still rise, but not as much as the actual increase. In that case, replacement has
 contributed to a rise in post-materialism. When replacement effects are re-
 moved, there may be no change in the value index. In that case, replacement
 has created the trend toward post-materialism.

 Our estimates of the effects of replacement are presented in Figures 1
 through 6. In each figure the solid line shows the actual value scores for the
 country, while the broken line presents our estimate of what the scores
 would have been if there had been no replacement. '0 For each country we

 '?Our basic problem is assigining a value for the oldest cohort after the number of cases

 becomes too small to make reliable estimates or when the cohort becomes so old that
 differential death rates confound our ability to make longitudinally comparable inferences.
 After 1973, we no longer present results for the cohort born before 1906. In Germany, Britain,
 The Netherlands, and France we set the value for this cohort according to the mean of its index
 scores in the 1970-71 and 1973 surveys. In Belgium and Italy strong period effects (see
 Inglehart, 1985b) render this procedure unacceptable, since the oldest cohort would be
 insulated artificially from forces that subsequently contributed to materialism among all of the
 other cohorts. We therefore assigned the cohort born before 1906 the same value as members of
 the 1906-15 cohort (or the 1916-25 cohort in 1983 and 1984). After 1982, we no longer utilize
 results for the 1906-15 cohort (see note 8 above). For all six countries we assigned a value to this
 cohort based upon the mean of its index scores in 1981 and 1982.

 will base our conclusions mainly on the three most recent years, that is to say
 those years for which we have over a full decade's worth of replacement.
 Beginning with Germany (see Figure 1) we see that through 1981 there

 was little change in values, while there would have been a rise in materialism
 if there had been no replacement. By 1982, however, the value index was 12
 points above the 1970-71 starting point, by 1983 it had risen 26 points, and
 by 1984 it was 31 points above the 1970-71 baseline. If there had been no
 replacement, the value index would have been virtually the same in 1982 as
 it was in our first surveys (a decline of 2 points); by 1983 it would have risen
 only 7 points, and by 1984 it would have been 14 points above the 1970-71
 level. Our overall conclusion is that replacement contributed to the rise in
 post-materialism. Post-materialism would have increased somewhat with-
 out replacement, but the gains would have been far smaller than the actual
 increase.

 for 1984, see Table 2 of this article.

 In Britain (see Figure 2) post-materialism dropped in 1976 and 1977,
 both years of high inflation, but it would have declined even more if there
 had been no replacement. By 1982, the value index was 16 points above the
 1970-71 baseline, in 1983 it was 14 points higher, and by 1984 it was 21
 points above the score registered in our first surveys. Without generational
 replacement post-materialism would have been only 8 points higher in 1982
 than in 1970-71, only 5 points higher in 1983, and only 10 points higher in
 1984. The data for all three years lead to the same conclusion: replacement
 contributed to the rise in post-materialism.

 In The Netherlands (see Figure 3) post-materialism moved upward
 after 1970-71, but dropped sharply in 1980, a year with high inflation. It
 would have dropped more, however, if there had been no replacement
 during these years. After 1980, post-materialism moved upward, and in the

 In 1982, the value index was 10 points above the starting point for our time
 series, in 1983 it was 19 points higher, and in 1984 it was 15 points higher
 than the 1970-71 baseline. Yet without replacement the value index would
 have been virtually the same in 1982 as in 1970-71 (a gain of 2 points), and
 in both 1983 and 1984 it would have been only 6 points above our baseline
 surveys. Replacement was a major force contributing to post-materialist
 values.

 In France (see Figure 4) replacement reversed a slight trend toward
 materialism. While changes are small, the results for the three most recent
 years are remarkably similar. In 1982, 1983, and 1984 our index score was
 somewhat above the 1970-71 starting point, with gains of 6, 5, and 4 points,
 respectively. If there had been no replacement, the value index in all three

 years would have been 5 points below the 1970-71 level. Of course, the
 observed gains in post-materialism are small, and the trend line in France is
 flatter than that in any of the other five countries. Indeed, there appears to
 have been a near-equilibrium process at work in which replacement coun-
 terbalanced the period or life-cycle effects that contributed to materialism
 as cohorts moved through the life cycle.

 In Belgium (see Figure 5) there has been a sizable growth in material-
 ism, but throughout the entire period materialism would have been greater
 if there had been no replacement. Even though post-materialism rebounded
 in 1984, from 1980 onward materialism has been higher than it was in the
 early 1970s. In 1982 the value index was 12 points lower than that recorded
 in 1970-71, in 1983 it was 18 points lower, and in 1984 it was 10 points

 would have been 23 points lower, and in 1984 it would have been 19 points
 lower. Thus, replacement impeded a trend toward materialism.

 In Italy (see Figure 6) materialism grew sharply through 1980, a year with

 a very sharp increase in inflation. As we can see, materialism would have
 increased even more if there had been no replacement. Since 1980 post-
 materialism has risen, and the rebound in 1984 pushed the value index close to
 the 1970-71 starting point. Even so, from 1977 on materialism has been higher
 than it was in the early 1970s. Turning to the three most recent years, we find
 that in 1982 the value index was 9 points below the 1970-71 baseline, in 1983 it

 Results for a Combined Sample of Six West European Publics

 While our results clearly demonstrate that replacement affects value

 change, we have presented a mixed picture since replacement has led to three
 different patterns-contributing to a trend, preventing a trend, and impeding
 a trend. In none of these societies was generational replacement the sole force
 creatinga trend toward post-materialism. But replacement does create a trend
 toward post-materialism for Western European society as a whole. The sepa-
 rate samples for these six societies can be combined by weighting procedures
 to represent the combined population of all six countries. Indeed, such a
 combined sample has been analyzed in several articles (see Inglehart, 1983,

 now based upon over 1,000 cases, and even the smallest cohorts contain
 over 600 cases.

 When we examine the index scores for the combined sample, we do find
 year-to-year fluctuations and can be confident that all but the smallest of
 them reflect real change. Indeed, there is a strong relationship between
 changes in the overall value index and changes in the average annual
 inflation rates for these societies. (See Inglehart, 1985a, 1985b.) Despite
 year-to-year fluctuations, post-materialism does not rise through 1981, and
 is even slightly lower in 1981 than it was when these surveys began. In the
 last three years, however, post-materialism rises, and is clearly higher by
 1984 than it was in 1970-71. In our earliest surveys, there were four
 materialists for every post-materialist. In 1984, materialists still outnum-
 bered post-materialists, but the margin had been cut to two to one. (See
 Abramson and Inglehart, 1985, Table 1, for the full distribution of values for
 each year.)

 As with each of the six countries, the younger cohorts tend to be more
 post-materialist than their elders, while the older cohorts are the most
 materialist. We will briefly summarize the major changes in cohort values
 over time that bear on our conclusions:

 1. Between 1970-71 and 1980 materialism tends to rise among all five
 cohorts that can be tracked over this period. As of 1981, all five cohorts were
 more materialist than they were in 1970-71.
 2. After 1981, post-materialism among the cohorts begins to rise. By 1984,
 all four cohorts that can be meaningfully tracked over the full 14-year
 period had close to the same value scores as they had registered in 1970-71.

 While we attribute year-to-year variation in cohort values to period
 effects (see Inglehart, 1985a, 1985b), this interpretation is not essential to
 our conclusions in this article. Since cohorts did not become more material-
 ist, we expect replacement to lead to rising levels of post-materialism.

 Indeed, when we apply our algebraic standardization procedures for
 the combined European sample, we find that replacement is the major
 force leading to the growth of post-materialist values. 12 Figure 7 presents
 our estimates. As with our earlier figures (1 through 6), the solid line shows
 the actual scores on our value index, while the broken line shows what
 those scores would have been if there had been no generational replace-

 for our replacement estimates) is as follows: the 1946-55 cohort made up 16.5 percent of the
 combined sample; the 1936-45 cohort made up 18.8 percent; the 1926-35 cohort made up 17.7
 percent; the 1916-25 cohort made up 17.6 percent; the 1906-15 cohort made up 14.9 percent;
 and the cohort born before 1906 made up 14.4 percent.

 aAssuming that no cohorts born after 1955 entered the adult population and that older

 cohorts did not diminish through death. For the index scores in 1970-71 and in 1984, see Table
 3 of this article. For the index scores from 1973 through 1983, see Inglehart (1985a, Figure 5, p.
 105). For the distribution of respondents by years ofbirth in 1970-7 1, see note 12 ofthis article.

 ment.13 We find that in the early 1980s scores on our value index had
 actually declined somewhat, but that they would have declined even more
 if there had been no replacement. If our analyses ended with the 1981
 results, we would conclude that replacement had impeded a trend toward
 materialism. In the three most recent years, however, the pattern changes.
 By 1982, the value index was 7 points above the 1970-71 starting point, in
 1983 it was 8 points higher, and by 1984 it was 13 points above the 1970-71

 13 In making these estimates, we again face the problem of assigning a value for the oldest

 cohorts after the number of cases become too small to make reliable estimates or when the
 sample becomes so old that differential death rates confound our ability to make longitudinally
 comparable inferences. After 1973 we no longer utilize results for the cohort born before 1906,
 and we set the value for that cohort according to the mean of its index scores for the 1970-71
 and 1973 surveys. After 1982, we no longer utilize results for the 1906-15 cohort, and we
 assigned a value to this cohort based upon the mean of its index scores in 1981 and 1982.

 baseline. Without replacement, the 1982 score would have been 4 points
 lower than that in the 1970-71 survey, in 1983 it would have been 3 points
 lower, while in 1984 it would have been 2 points higher. On balance, we
 conclude that for these societies as a whole replacement created the trend
 toward post-materialism. Post-materialism clearly rose, but without inter-
 generational population replacement there would have been virtually no
 change in overall levels of post-materialism.

 Conclusions

 Generational replacement is an important process that affected the
 overall distribution of values between 1970-71 and 1984, but it is only one
 component in any prediction of how these values will develop in the future.
 Change will depend upon future levels of economic security as well as
 generational replacement. Were replacement the only factor influencing
 value trends, post-materialism would have risen in all six societies.

 Although we cannot predict future economic conditions, our results
 suggest that replacement will continue to exert pressure pushing overall
 levels of post-materialism upward. The younger cohorts register relatively
 high levels of post-materialism in all six societies, 14 and unless there are high
 levels of economic insecurity in the future, new cohorts are likely to have
 relatively high levels of post-materialism. Moreover, the older cohorts in all
 six societies tend to have relatively high levels of materialism.

 Replacement will slow down for the remainder of the century because

 of relatively low birth rates since the mid- I 960s. Even so, replacement will
 lead to substantial changes in the distribution of the population in all six
 societies. According to our calculations,"5 by the year 2000 persons born
 before the end of World War Il will make up only about a third of the adult
 population in these six societies. Persons born after 1969, who were too
 young to be included in our most recent survey, will make up 20 percent of
 the adult population in Germany, 23 percent in Belgium, 24 percent in
 United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Italy, and 25 percent in France.

 We do not know what values these youths will have, but replacement is

 likely to be a major influence on value change in all six societies. Indeed, we
 have projected the future impact of generational replacement for the com-
 bined European population under a variety of assumptions (see Abramson

 1"Given the small number of respondents we did not present results for the cohort born

 between 1966 and 1969, but in all six countries these youths had relatively high levels of
 post-materialism in 1982, 1983, and 1984.

 '50ur calculations are based upon population projections reported by the Statistical

 Office of the European Communities (1984, Table 11 for each country). For our estimates of
 the future age distribution for each country, see Abramson and Inglehart (1985, Table A5). For
 our estimates for the combined population of all six, see Table A6.

 and Inglehart, 1985, Figure 3). Even if all cohorts retain their 1984 values,
 and even if the cohorts entering the adult population are no more post-
 materialist than the 1956-65 cohort, post-materialism will rise. There are
 clearly conditions under which post-materialism would decline. But even
 under such conditions, replacement would very likely slow down any move-
 ment toward materialism.

 Future projections are necessarily problematic. But the results from the
 past 14 years seem fairly clear. In Germany, Britain, and The Netherlands,
 where post-materialism rose, replacement played a major role contributing
 to this trend. In France replacement reversed short-term forces contributing
 to materialism, while in Belgium and Italy replacement partially offset
 short-term forces that contributed to materialism. For these six societies as
 a whole, replacement created the trend toward post-materialism. On bal-
 ance, replacement is a major long-term force promoting post-materialism.
