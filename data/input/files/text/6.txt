 SHIFTING FAMILY DEFINITIONS: THE EFFECT OF COHABITATION AND OTHER

 NONFAMILY HOUSEHOLD RELATIONSHIPS ON MEASURES OF POVERTY

 KURT J. BAUMAN

 The current officialpoverty measure compares income to needs

 within a family. Some have suggested including cohabiting couples
 as part of this family. Others have suggested that the household be
 used as the unit of analysis for poverty measurement. I explore is-
 sues involved in expanding the unit of analysis, including the stabil-
 ity of cohabiting and other nonfamily household relationships and
 the degree of resource sharing that takes place among different
 types of people within households. Instability in households with
 nonfamily members is not a serious problem for inferring poverty
 from cross-sectional studies. On the other hand, income from people
 in nonfamily household roles contributes slightly less to helping
 other household members avoid financial hardship, implying that
 nonfamily housemates have a greater tendency to keep income to
 themselves.

 C oncern over poverty has become increasingly tied to
 concerns over changes in family structure (Levy 1987;
 McLanahan and Sandefur 1994; Wilson 1987). This concern
 about poverty, along with the rise in levels of nonmarital co-
 habitation (Bennett, Blanc, and Bloom 1988; McLanahan
 and Casper 1995; Wiersma 1983), has contributed to interest
 in changing the unit of analysis for measuring poverty. Pov-
 erty is currently defined as a characteristic of family mem-
 bers living together in a household. An expanded unit of
 analysis would include cohabiting couples and their families,
 and possibly all people who reside in a household. There
 have been few attempts, however, to determine the impact of
 such a change on poverty measurement.

 I examine the impact of measuring poverty with a unit
 of analysis that includes household members not related to
 the household head (nonfamily members) on measured pov-
 erty levels; assess the extent to which measurement reliabil-
 ity is affected by the transient nature of nonfamily house-
 hold relationships; and examine the degree to which resource
 sharing takes place among household groups. Finally, I as-

 sess the degree to which cohabitants and other nonfamily
 housemates differ from family members and from each other
 along these dimensions.

 BACKGROUND
 Researchers currently measure poverty by comparing the
 sum of the incomes of all family members (people in a
 household who are related by blood or marriage, or a single
 individual if there are no relatives) with an income thresh-
 old that depends on the number of people in this family.
 Some have proposed that the unit of analysis for measuring
 poverty be expanded to include other household members.
 One approach would be to count cohabiting couples as
 members of the same family (see Citro and Michael
 1995:302-308). Another would be to count everyone in a
 household, regardless of family relationship (Mayer and
 Jencks 1989).

 In deciding whether to choose a new unit of analysis for
 measuring poverty, one must consider whether it increases
 the usefulness of poverty as a social indicator and as a policy
 tool. Many state and federal programs are directly tied to the
 poverty standard, either for determining eligibility or for dis-
 tributing benefits across jurisdictions (Fisher 1992, 1996).
 The measure of poverty also influences many antipoverty
 programs not directly tied to the poverty standard.

 As a social indicator, poverty should be understandable,
 reliable, valid, and sensitive to true changes in material well-
 being (see Innes 1990). The choice of unit of analysis must
 take into account that income is received by some (e.g., par-
 ents) in order to support consumption by others (e.g., chil-
 dren). To reflect individual material well-being, the unit of
 analysis should be a group within which individuals enjoy
 equal access to resources. These points are briefly consid-
 ered below.

 Impact on Measured Poverty Levels
 A first step in examining change in the unit of analysis is to
 examine its impact on measured levels of poverty. Manning
 and Lichter (1996) found that approximately 13% of chil-
 dren in single-parent families lived with a person identified
 in the 1990 census as an unmarried partner. Of these, 43%
 lived in poverty by the standard poverty definition, whereas
 31 % would have been considered poor if the unmarried part-
 ner were counted as family.

 The existing evidence, therefore, is that a change in the
 unit of analysis may result in a substantial reclassification of
 people in certain population subgroups. The examination of

 the impact on children must be supplemented by an exami-
 nation of the impact on other groups and by an examination
 of the impact of nonfamily household members on poverty
 measurement.

 Effect on Reliability of Poverty Measurement
 A major question regarding nonfamily living arrangements
 is their transient nature. Assessments of living situations at
 one point may not reflect actual living arrangements over the
 longer period (usually one year) used as the basis for deter-
 mining poverty status. Most data sets used for examining
 poverty present information on household composition only
 at a single point. No studies have directly examined how well
 such snapshot measures reflect cohabitation spells within the
 reference year.

 Measuring the Sharing of Material Resources
 Probably the most important factor to consider in moving to
 an expanded unit of analysis is how well it characterizes the
 economic status of individuals within the unit. The current
 poverty measure implicitly assumes that economic status is
 primarily shared within the family. As living arrangements
 have become more diverse, however, it has become more dif-
 ficult to assert that families have special characteristics that
 set them apart from other groups that live together.

 There is mixed evidence on how closely nonfamily re-
 lationships resemble family relationships. Cohabiting rela-
 tionships are shorter term than marriage (Bumpass and
 Sweet 1989). When cohabiting couples are compared with
 married couples in other ways, significant differences are
 often found, with cohabitants usually falling somewhere in
 between married couples and single people. This is true of
 childbearing (Bumpass, Raley, and Sweet 1995; Loomis and
 Landale 1994), fertility expectations (Rindfuss and Vanden
 Heuvel 1990), housework allocation (Shelton and John
 1993; South and Spitze 1994), and school enrollment and
 labor force participation (Rindfuss and Vanden Heuvel
 1 990).

 There have been few attempts, however, to examine the
 issue of resource sharing-perhaps because of the difficulty
 in operationalizing resource sharing. Broadly speaking, re-
 source sharing within households is the degree to which re-
 sources nominally controlled by one household member are
 available to others. However, several aspects of resource
 sharing could be measured.

 One way of addressing the question of resource sharing
 is to look at resource pooling. If people keep joint bank ac-
 counts or spend money without keeping track of whose
 money is involved, there is a greater chance that each mem-
 ber of the family will have access to those collective re-
 sources to meet his or her needs. Yet, some members may
 have greater control over these resources than others.

 If power over resources is important, perhaps it would
 be better to examine the exercise of this power directly. Dis-
 proportionate power over spending, however, does not nec-
 essarily result in spending disproportionately to meet one
 person's needs at the expense of others.

 Another criterion for judging how income is shared is
 how resources are used to affect other members' well-being.
 This criterion gets closer to the heart of the matter, but it
 suffers from the problem of defining appropriate measures
 of well-being. For both practical and conceptual reasons,
 consumption within families cannot easily be divided among
 members (Betson 1990; Lazear and Michael 1988). And even
 if it were possible, it might require imposing value judge-
 ments on people's expenditure patterns.

 In spite of these difficulties, this is an attractive approach
 when aspects of people's consumption can be measured. I
 adopt this general approach, using several measures of mate-
 rial hardship to take account of the sharing of resources.

 The Nature of Household Relationships
 Ideally, the level at which poverty is measured should be eas-
 ily measured and well understood. Until recently, few sur-
 veys asked direct questions about the nature of relationships
 between potential cohabitants. Researchers often have had
 to infer cohabitation from data indicating that unmarried
 adults of the opposite sex are living in the same household.
 This leads to a certain degree of mismeasurement (Manning
 1995).1

 Using the family or the household as the unit of mea-
 surement results in fewer problems. Families and households
 are the targets of most public programs aimed at reducing
 poverty. Information on these units of analysis is also avail-
 able from surveys that do not ask about cohabiting relation-
 ships-including most surveys administered in the past.

 Thus, if the unit of analysis were expanded, measuring
 poverty at the household level may be more desirable. This
 level of measurement makes sense, however, only if non-
 cohabiting housemates resemble cohabitants along the di-
 mensions discussed previously.

 Questions Addressed in the Current Research
 This research addresses several basic questions on the desir-
 ability of expanding the unit of analysis for determining pov-
 erty: (1) the size of the impact of changing the unit of analy-
 sis on measured poverty rates; (2) whether cohabitants and
 other nonfamily housemates reside in a household long
 enough to make it worthwhile to count their incomes; (3)
 whether cohabitants and other nonfamily housemates share
 resources in the same way that families do; and (4) whether
 cohabitants more closely resemble family members or
 noncohabiting housemates.

 I start by examining the prevalence of cohabitation and
 other nonfamily household relationships in population sub-
 groups. I look at the poverty rates among population sub-

 1. Using the 1990 census, Manning (1995) found that 75% of
 opposite-sex adults sharing living quarters were also self-identified cohabi-
 tants. In turn, 80% of self-identified cohabitants were classified correctly
 based on the opposite-sex housemate criterion. This method of inferring
 cohabiting status misses some cohabiting couples because certain restric-
 tions are usually applied. Those who differ in age by more than a certain
 number of years (usually 10 or 15) and people living in group quarters or
 with several housemates of the opposite sex are usually excluded.

 groups before and after accounting for cohabitation and
 other nonfamily household relationships and examine how
 prevalence and poverty rates are affected by taking account
 of the duration of cohabitation and other nonfamily house-
 hold relationships. Finally, I address resource sharing by ex-
 amining material hardship. Compared with the income re-
 ceived by family members, how much does the income of
 cohabitants and other nonfamily members reduce material
 hardship?

 DATA
 The data for most of this study are from the 1990 through
 1992 panels of the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income
 and Program Participation (SIPP). Tabulations and descrip-
 tive analysis focus on calendar year 1990 data from the 1990
 panel (Waves 1 through 4); the regression analyses use
 Waves 3 through 6 of the 1991 panel and Waves 1 through 3
 of the 1992 panel.

 The 1990 SIPP longitudinal panel file contains 49,600
 cases designated as calendar year 1990 respondents. These
 were weighted to match January 1990 population estimates
 from the CPS, or 246 million people. After I dropped cases
 with missing data, the file contained 48,763 cases, represent-
 ing a total population of 242 million. Some analyses used
 data for March 1991 matched to the calendar year 1990 lon-
 gitudinal file. Because of the need to match the two time pe-
 riods, the file contained fewer observations: 47,420 cases,
 representing 235 million people. The 1990 panel did not in-
 clude the questions on material hardship that were of interest
 for the regression analyses; I therefore used data from the
 1991 and 1992 panels for that portion of the work. Wave 6
 of the 1991 panel included a topical module on well-being
 administered to the reference person in each household (or
 his/her proxy), providing needed data on material hardship.
 An identical questionnaire was administered during Wave 3
 of the 1992 panel. These panels overlapped so that both sets
 of questionnaires were in the field at the same time: winter
 of 1992-1993. There were 12,508 households in the 1991
 panel and 17,818 in the 1992 panel, for a total of 30,326
 cases for analysis.

 Using data from the March Demographic Supplement of
 the Current Population Survey (CPS), 1985 to 1998, I pro-
 duced estimates of the effect of changes in cohabitation and
 household living arrangements on the levels of poverty that
 would be observed under expanded units of analysis.2 The
 file provides observations on 50,000 to 60,000 households
 and 130,000 to 180,000 individuals per year.

 I estimated standard errors presented in the tabulations
 by resampling methods. Because this was not practical for
 regression analyses, I used a design effect of 1.5 to adjust
 reported standard errors.3

 2. These analyses were carried out with public-use data files produced

 by the Unicon Research Corporation (1998).

 3. I calculated standard errors using pseudo-stratum codes available
 with the SIPP file. I also estimated standard errors of regressions using these
 codes, yielding an average design effect of 1.3 to 1.5 for the types of analy-
 ses undertaken here.

 RESULTS

 Rates of Living in Nonfamily Households

 Table 1 shows the number and percentage of people living
 in households with nonfamily members from the 1990 SIPP.
 In this table, all members of a family in which a member is
 cohabiting are classified as cohabitants. For example, chil-
 dren may be cohabitants if they live with a parent who co-
 habits. Similarly, all people in households with noncohabit-
 ing housemates are counted as noncohabiting housemates.
 Because the SIPP did not ask about the nature of opposite-
 sex relationships until 1996, people were considered co-
 habitants if they were over 15, unmarried, and living with
 one other such person of the opposite sex to whom they
 were not related.

 The first column of the table shows the population of
 various demographic groups in the United States, estimated
 from the 1990 SIPP panel. The second through fifth columns
 show cohabitation rates according to the SIPP's monthly ac-
 counting of living situations.

 There is surprisingly little variation in the rate of living
 in cohabiting family situations across the population sub-
 groups. Between 1% and 2% lived in short-term cohabiting
 situations, whereas 3% to 5% were in cohabiting households
 six or more months of the year. The major exceptions are
 young adults, who had higher cohabitation rates; older
 people, who had lower rates; and members of single-parent
 families, among whom about 13% lived in a cohabiting situ-
 ation at some time during 1990. Overall, three quarters of
 those who cohabited at any time during the year (3.84% out
 of 5.13%) were in cohabiting situations that lasted six
 months or more.

 The last four columns of Table 1 show the prevalence of
 people in households with noncohabiting housemates. Co-
 habitants are nonfamily household members by definition,
 but they have been excluded from the group under consider-
 ation here. The pattern among groups of people living with
 noncohabiting housemates is very similar to the pattern
 among those living with cohabitants.

 Poverty Rates With Alternative Units of Analysis
 Table 2 shows poverty rates and examines how alternative
 units of analysis would affect measured levels of poverty. I
 calculated poverty by comparing the sum of monthly family
 income amounts with the sum of monthly poverty thresholds.
 Expanding the unit of analysis reclassifies some nonpoor
 families as poor, because members added to the unit of analy-
 sis add to the level of need but do not contribute income. It
 is far more common, however, for families no longer to be
 classified as poor, as most nonfamily housemates have some
 amount of income.

 Overall, the changes in poverty resulting from expanded
 units of analysis is small but noticeable. Cohabitants seem to
 account for about 60% of reduction in poverty for those in
 households with nonfamily members, while cohabitants and
 their families represent a little under 60% of people in these
 households.

 Accounting for nonfamily relationships has a larger im-
 pact on several subgroups than on others. Among the mem-
 bers of single-parent families, accounting for all nonfamily
 members shifts the poverty rate downward by 4.5 percentage
 points. Adding only cohabitants reduces poverty by about half
 this amount-2.8 percentage points. In addition to single-par-
 ent families, young adults are also greatly affected by ac-
 counting for nonfamily members in calculating poverty.

 Table 3 shows how shifting the unit of analysis to in-
 clude cohabitants or entire households would have affected
 historical poverty rates. These figures, calculated from the
 Current Population Survey, show a steadily increasing im-
 pact of changes in poverty definition (from a 1.5-point to just
 over 2-point reduction moving to a household definition),
 reflecting an overall increase in the prevalence of nonfamily
 living arrangements (Saluter 1994). Shifting the unit of

 analysis, however, has a negligible impact on the pattern of
 year-to-year changes in poverty.4

 Income and Poverty of Families Living With
 Nonfamily Housemates
 Including cohabitants and other nonfamily housemates in the
 resource unit affects the measurement of poverty fairly sub-
 stantially, given the small number of households involved.

 4. The CPS data show a slightly larger impact of changing the unit of
 analysis than is evident from the SIPP. In 1990, the shift to a household unit
 of analysis would have lowered poverty 1.0 percentage point based on the
 1990 SIPP (Table 2) and 1.8 percentage points based on the March 1991
 CPS (Table 3). The CPS estimates also show cohabitants accounting for a
 somewhat smaller share of the poverty reduction from changing units of
 analysis than is seen in the SIPP data. Data from the 1990 census examined
 by Manning and Lichter (1996) show a smaller number of children who
 would be reclassified out of poverty if the definition of family for calculat-

 This implies that the definitional change makes a big differ-
 ence for households that contain cohabitants or other non-
 family members. Table 4 shows these effects.

 Of those who are poor and live in cohabiting households,
 55.6% would no longer be counted as poor if cohabitants and
 their families were included in the resource base for calcu-
 lating poverty, whereas 44.4% would remain poor (row 1 of
 Table 4). Of those poor people living with noncohabiting
 housemates, approximately 60% would no longer be counted
 as poor. The income of nonfamily household members
 clearly makes a substantial difference for poor people living
 in these situations.

 Rows 2 to 6 of Table 4 show how income from poor
 people and the nonfamily members living with them contrib-
 ute to closing the poverty gap. Row 2 shows that the income

 ing poverty were expanded to include cohabitants. Thus, it is unclear
 whether the SIPP data underestimate or overestimate the impact of cohabi-
 tation and other nonfamily living arrangements.

 of the poor people living with nonfamily housemates is quite
 low-not much over $5,000 per year for any of the three
 groups shown. To eliminate their poverty status, they would
 have to add more than $4,000 to their family income (row 3).
 If the unit of analysis were expanded to include non-
 family household members, the larger number of people in
 the group would make for an increase in the poverty thresh-
 old. The increase in the poverty threshold resulting from add-
 ing more people to the unit is reflected in row 4.5

 Row 5 shows the income of the nonfamily household
 members who live with poor housemates. Row 6 shows the
 average total income for each type of expanded household. On

 5. This number is larger for people living with noncohabiting house-
 mates because, on average, there are a greater number of these housemates
 in a household than there are in the average cohabiting household. The lower
 number of cohabitants, however, may be partly an artifact of the identifica-
 tion of cohabiting couples in this research, because households with mul-
 tinle housemates often were not counted as cohabiting.

 aEstimates for these years differ slightly from published poverty estimates due to changes in weighting schemes used by the Census

 Bureau.

 average, the combined income is well in excess of that needed
 to bring the everyone in the unit above the poverty line.

 Row 7 of Table 4 shows the number of months each type
 of nonfamily household member remained in the household.
 In all three cases, the average duration is close to 10 months.
 The potential additional income available from nonfamily
 housemates over the entire year is generally only $2,000 to
 $3,000 above the amount they actually added to the house-
 hold (compare rows 5 and 8).

 Table 5 shows selected information from Table 4 as it
 applies to population subgroups. The percentage that would
 be reclassified as nonpoor varies quite a bit across subgroups.
 The differences in poverty status in the expanded units of
 analysis are not due to differences in the amount of income
 among poor people living with nonfamily housemates (sec-
 ond column) or in the time spent in nonfamily relationships
 during 1990 (next to last column). The key factor seems to be
 the amount of income available from nonfamily housemates.

 Point-in-Time Versus Longitudinal Measures

 The strength of the SIPP data is the recording of month-to-
 month changes in household composition and income. Point-
 in-time estimates of poverty rely on retrospective reports of
 the year's income and use household composition as it exists
 at the time of the survey (mid-March in the CPS and April 1
 in the census). This works fairly well for families as they are
 traditionally defined, but noncohabiting housemates and co-
 habitants are much less likely to remain in the household
 over long periods.

 Table 6 shows that 80.0% of those in a cohabiting fam-
 ily in March 1991 had been in such a relationship for six
 months or more during 1990. Conversely, of those who were
 in a cohabiting family for 6 to 12 months of 1990, 76.4%
 were in cohabiting relationships in March 1991 (data not
 shown). The numbers are practically identical for households
 with noncohabiting housemates.6

 The bottom two rows of Table 6 show how the decrease
 in measured poverty moving from family to larger units of
 analysis is affected by using household composition in
 March 1991 as opposed to using month-to-month changes in

 household composition. Only a small portion of those whose
 poverty status would be changed by counting the income of
 nonfamily housemates present in the household the follow-
 ing March were misclassified. Around 90% would also have
 been reclassified by month-to-month accounting of the pres-
 ence of nonfamily housemates. However, a larger portion of
 those who received enough month-to-month income from a
 nonfamily housemate to move above poverty were missed
 when the household was classified the following March.
 Most of the misclassification occurred because the nonfamily
 housemate was no longer in the household in March.

 What does this suggest about using annual point-in-time
 estimates for estimating poverty and nonfamily household re-
 lationships? Point-in-time questions about household compo-
 sition and income clearly provide reasonable assessments, but
 miss about one quarter of those households with enough in-
 come from housemates to move above the poverty line.

 The Effect of Household Composition on Material
 Hardship
 The foregoing results shed some light on the practicality of
 counting cohabitants as part of a family and on using house-
 holds as a basis for measuring poverty. But what of the shar-
 ing of resources? The 1991 and 1992 panels of SIPP asked a
 series of questions on material hardship that were similar to

 those used by Mayer and Jencks (1989) in their analysis of
 poverty and material hardship in Chicago. Several of these
 hardship measures were used in the present analysis. House-
 hold heads were asked, "During the past 12 months, has there
 been a time when your household did not meet its essential
 expenses? By essential expenses, I mean things like the mort-
 gage or rent payment, utility bills, or important medical
 care." They were then asked about instances when the house-
 hold did not pay the full amount of rent or mortgage, did not
 pay the full amount of utility bills, had telephone service cut
 off due to nonpayment, had someone who needed to go to
 the doctor or hospital but didn't go, and had someone who
 needed to see a dentist but didn't go. Household heads were
 also asked if their households sometimes or often did not get
 enough to eat.

 Following Mayer and Jencks (1989) and Short and Shea
 (1995), I summed answers to the seven questions to create
 an index of hardship; 0 indicates no hardship, and 7 indi-
 cates that all seven types were experienced. I analyzed this
 index using Tobit regression, shown in Table 7. (Results from
 a series of regressions on the seven separate hardship mea-
 sures are available upon request.)

 If cohabitants and other nonfamily housemates contrib-
 uted resources to partners and their families in the same way
 as married people, one would expect that an increase in co-
 habitants' income would decrease the probability of experi-
 encing these types of material hardship to the same extent
 that one would find among spouses. On the other hand, if
 cohabitants were unable to contribute money to others in the
 household (for example, because of increased health insur-
 ance costs or difficulties in borrowing money), or if they pur-
 chased items that served personal priorities rather than
 household needs, their income would contribute less to re-
 ducing material hardship.

 The first pair of variables are total household income
 and income squared. The household income variable has a
 strong negative impact on hardship. Every $10,000 of in-

 come reduces the number of expected hardship incidents
 nearly by 1. Household income squared is also significant,
 indicating that income has a diminishing impact on level of
 hardship, as might be expected. Because I have taken sepa-
 rate account of the income of other household members, the
 effect of total household income in this equation is equal to
 the effect of the household head's income, which is treated
 as an omitted category.

 Once total household income is controlled, the effect of
 spouse's income is significantly positive, indicating that in-
 come from a spouse contributes less toward reducing hard-
 ship levels than income from the household head. By con-
 trast, income of other family members has a negative coeffi-
 cient, suggesting that income from other family members
 contributes even more to lessening household hardship than
 that of the household head. This result at first seems puz-
 zling. The effect, however, is due to the strong correlation
 between income from other family members and the age of
 the household head. Once age is controlled (in later regres-
 sions), other family members' income seems to have about
 the same effect as spouses' income.

 Income from cohabitants and noncohabiting housemates
 contributes significantly less to reducing household hardship
 than income from the household head. More important, in-
 come from cohabitants and from other housemates seems to
 have an even smaller effect on hardship than spouses' in-
 come. The difference between the effects of spouses' income
 and cohabitants' income is not quite significant, whereas the
 difference between the income of spouses and the income of
 nonfamily is significant at conventional levels.

 An obvious problem with drawing broader conclusions
 from these results is that they do not control for other factors
 that might influence the relationship between hardship and
 income of nonfamily household members. For example, a
 family experiencing hardship may be forced to move in with
 nonfamily housemates in order to make ends meet (cf. Edin
 and Lein 1997).

 No perfect control for this type of situation is possible
 without identifying a set of influences that determine cohabi-
 tation separately from the experience of hardship, and the
 variables available in the SIPP are unable perform this func-
 tion. I can partially address the problem, however, by con-
 trolling for as many factors as possible using the rich array
 of measures available in the SIPP. Hardship, as measured
 here, is expected to be related to family composition, demo-
 graphic factors, factors that influence general, material well-

 being, and factors associated with disruptions in living situa-
 tions. A full set of such controls is added to regression 2 in
 Table 7. Many of these variables-especially age, race,
 household size, medical insurance, and homeownership-
 have a large impact on hardship. However, there is essen-
 tially no change in the coefficients on the income variables
 (with the exception of income from other family members).
 Regression 3 presents one additional approach to testing
 whether the relationship between income from nonfamily
 members and hardship is biased because of the reciprocal ef-
 fect of hardship on living arrangements. The regression in-
 cludes separate coefficients of income on hardship for co-
 habitants and noncohabiting housemates who began the year
 in the household and for those who moved in during the year.
 The latter group is too small to produce reliable coefficient
 estimates. The coefficients for those who were there from
 the beginning, however, show no signs of diminution from
 the comparable values in regression 2.

 The evidence from Table 7 shows a contrast between
 spouses and other family members on the one hand, and
 nonfamily housemates (both cohabiting and noncohabiting)
 on the other. In the three regressions shown, the contrast with
 spouses' income is sometimes significant for cohabitants (2
 of 3 regressions) and sometimes significant for other house-
 mates (1 of 3). These nominal levels of significance should
 be treated with caution, as there are several comparisons ex-
 amined here (among spouses' income, other family mem-
 bers' income, cohabitants' income, and other housemates'
 income). Nonetheless, there is a clear pattern here: Those
 with spousal and family relationships to the household head
 are most likely, and those with less formal relationships are
 least likely, to contribute to the basic needs of the household
 as perceived by the household head.7

 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
 This research was designed to address some of the practical
 issues and the desirability of changing the current family
 definition for calculating poverty. For certain subgroups, par-
 ticularly young adults and single-parent families, counting
 cohabitants and noncohabiting housemates would have a
 fairly substantial impact on calculated rates of poverty. For
 most of the remaining population, it would not.

 A practical problem in defining families to include co-
 habitants and other housemates is that snapshot measures of

 7. Several additional objections could be raised regarding the regres-
 sion results presented here. First, tests were performed of interactions of the
 full set of income variables with age, race, presence of children in the house,
 and SIPP panel. In each case, the basic income contrast (spouses and other
 family versus cohabitants and other housemates) remained intact. Second,
 when income is reported by others rather than self-reported, the level of
 error is generally greater, and the coefficient of hardship on income is re-
 duced. This might especially affect the contrast between spouses and
 nonfamily housemates: Spouses were likely to serve as proxy respondents
 for the household and thus to be self-reporters for their incomne. After cases
 in which anyone other than the household head answered questions on hard-
 ship were eliminated, the contrasts between spouscs and nonfamily
 housemates were unaffected. This provides some assurance, but does not
 serve as a complete test for the effects of reporting error.

 nonfamily-housemate status do not perfectly capture poverty
 status as measured by accounting for changes in household
 composition during the previous year. The research here
 shows that this problem does not greatly invalidate point-in-
 time measures of poverty status.

 Who contributes income makes a difference for house-
 holds vulnerable to hardship. A household is more likely to
 experience hardship if a share of its income comes from
 someone other than the household head, especially if the in-
 come comes from cohabitants and other nonfamily house-
 mates. If future research confirms the similarity in economic
 contribution of cohabitants and noncohabiting housemates,
 this research provides reasonably strong evidence that their
 contribution is less than that of spouses.

 There is no evidence here to support treating cohabitants
 differently from other nonfamily household members in set-
 ting a poverty standard. The two groups seem almost identi-
 cal in their stability of residence and in the contribution their
 income makes to meeting household needs. Some of those
 counted as cohabitants in this study were unmarried people
 of opposite sex living together but not sharing a sexual rela-
 tionship, whereas some of those counted as housemates were
 in fact cohabiting partners. Despite this overlap, the major-
 ity of each group were probably correctly identified, and the
 measured characteristics of both groups were not just insig-
 nificantly different but nearly identical in every instance.

 There are reasons to be reticent about expanding the unit
 of analysis at all. Having nonfamily housemates is, at least
 in part, a consumption decision. Under an expanded unit of
 analysis, a person who was forced to "double up" could
 move out of poverty when his or her income fell. In addi-
 tion, most antipoverty programs-including the tax system,
 which has grown as an antipoverty tool in recent years-de-
 fine eligibility at the family level.

 Family and household relationships are changing, and a
 failure to make changes now could create a growing mis-
 match between poverty measurement and household arrange-
 ments in the future. For this reason, it will be valuable to
 verify the results presented here with other data and other
 approaches and to monitor future changes in household rela-
 tionships.
