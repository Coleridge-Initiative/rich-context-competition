Abstract
Background: With a goal to reduce youth smoking rates, the U.S. federal government mandated
that states enforce laws prohibiting underage tobacco sales. Our objective was to determine if state
compliance with tobacco sales laws is associated with a decreased risk of current daily smoking
among adolescents.
Methods: Data on tobacco use were obtained from a nationally representative sample of 16,244
adolescents from the 2003 Monitoring the Future survey. The association between merchant
compliance with the law from 1997­2003 and current daily smoking was examined using logistic
regression while controlling for cigarette prices, state restaurant smoking policies, anti-tobacco
media, and demographic variables.
Results: Higher average state merchant compliance from 1997­2003 predicted lower levels of
current daily smoking among adolescents when controlled for all other factors. The odds ratio for
daily smoking was reduced by 2% for each 1% increase in merchant compliance. After controlling
for price changes, media campaigns and smoking restrictions, a 20.8% reduction in the odds of
smoking among 10th graders in 2003 was attributed to the observed improvement in merchant
compliance between 1997 and 2003. A 47% reduction in the odds of daily smoking could be
attributed to price increases over this period.
Conclusion: Federally mandated enforcement efforts by states to prevent the sale of tobacco to
minors appear to have made an important contribution to the observed decline in smoking among
youth in the U.S. Given similar results from long-term enforcement efforts in Australia, other
countries should be encouraged to adopt the World Health Organization Framework on Tobacco
Control strategies to reduce the sale of tobacco to minors.
Background
Starting in 1987, public health advocates in the U.S. began
to pursue a supply-side strategy to reduce smoking among
adolescents by making it more difficult for youth to pur-
chase tobacco [1]. Initial efforts to enforce laws that pro-
hibit the sale of tobacco to minors occurred at the
community level and consisted of routine inspections of
retailers through test purchases conducted by underage
decoys [2]. In uncontrolled studies, declines in adolescent
smoking of 8%,[3] 26%,[4] 31%,[5] 44%[6] and 50%

[2,7] have been reported with interventions to prevent
tobacco sales to youth. In controlled studies, communi-
ties with strong enforcement have seen relative reductions
in youth smoking of 28%, [8,9] 44%, [10] and in three
studies, 50% [11-13] and 70% [14]. Seven multivariate
studies have shown a favorable impact of youth access
laws on adolescent smoking when controlled for price or
other tobacco control policies [15-21].
Following reports of substantial reductions in youth
smoking achieved by local enforcement [2,5,6], the U.S.
federal government enacted the Synar Amendment that
requires states to enact and enforce laws prohibiting the
sale of tobacco to minors [22]. Although the World
Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control recommends efforts to reduce the supply of
tobacco to youth [23], to our knowledge, extensive
enforcement efforts have so far been adopted only in the
U.S., Canada and Australia, and all three countries have
observed substantial and unprecedented reductions in
smoking among youth [13,24,25]. Additional strategies to
reduce the availability of tobacco to minors include bans
on cigarette vending machines and price increases
achieved through taxation and litigation. Demand reduc-
tion strategies for adolescents include bans on tobacco
advertising and promotions, package warning labels, anti-
tobacco education and mass-media programs, and efforts
to remove smoking imagery from films.
The impact of tobacco sales law enforcement has never
before been evaluated in a national study, although suc-
cessful results from a long-term regional study in Australia
are in press [13]. Prior to the Synar Amendment going
into effect in 1996 [26], compliance with tobacco sales
laws was uniformly poor across the U.S. [27]. Subsequent
to the Synar mandate, states instituted enforcement
involving test purchases (compliance tests) and fines [28].
Mandatory annual state progress reports document
marked improvement in compliance in 49 states between
1997 and 2003 [29]. Over these years, the prevalence of
daily smoking among 10th graders fell 51% nationwide
from 18.0% to 8.9% [30]. At the same time, states began
to adopt clean indoor air policies [31], the tobacco indus-
try settled a large suit and raised prices [32,33], and a
national anti-tobacco media campaign was launched in
2000 [34]. The purpose of this study was to determine if
average state-level compliance from 1997 to 2003 predicts
current daily smoking among 10th graders in 2003, while
considering the effects of price, clean indoor air policies,
and anti-tobacco media.
Methods
We studied the natural experiment resulting from geo-
graphic variations in youth's exposure to interventions.
Prospectively collected compliance data from 1997­2003
was used with data on price, smoking policies, and a
media campaign to determine the impact of each on the
odds that a youth was a daily smoker while controlling for
age, gender, race, Hispanic ethnicity and parental educa-
tion.
Population
We used the most current data (spring of 2003) from the
Monitoring the Future study (MTF), an annual survey con-
ducted in compliance with human subjects protections
[30]. Thirty-six states were included in a multi-stage pro-
portional sampling strategy with weighting to render a
nationally representative sample [30]. It should be noted
that the MTF sample is not representative of states and
state is not a cluster factor in the sample design. The sur-
vey was completed by 16,300 10th graders (age range 15­
17 years) reflecting a participation rate of 88%. Sociode-
mographic information was available for state of resi-
dence, and student-reported measures of age, gender, race,
ethnicity, and parental education. Race was dichotomized
as white/nonwhite and ethnicity as Hispanic/non-His-
panic. The MTF database includes a parental education
variable that is based on the average of maternal and
paternal education coded into 11 levels. As the MTF data
do not measure smoking prevalence by state, a state-level
analysis was not possible. For each state, data concerning
merchant compliance, cigarette prices, restaurant smok-
ing policies, and anti-tobacco media for each year from
1997 to 2003 were obtained.
Outcome Variables
Although the MTF survey also includes 8th and 12th grad-
ers, we chose to focus on 10th graders based on the consid-
eration that very few 8th graders purchase tobacco, and by
the 12th grade most youth can legally purchase it [8]. We
considered ever having tried smoking and current daily
smoking (smoking in the previous 30 days) as outcome
variables. Only 1% of youth purchase their first cigarette,
so enforcement would impact ever having tried smoking
only indirectly and we did not expect positive results [35].
Among current smokers, those who smoked daily would
be the most directly affected by enforcement programs
since youth do not typically begin to purchase their own
tobacco until they are daily smokers (smoking at least one
cigarette per day) [8].
State Compliance Rates
The Synar Amendment requires states to conduct annual
surveys to measure merchant compliance [26]. The sur-
veys are conducted by sending underage decoys into
stores to attempt to purchase tobacco. The surveys include
a representative statewide sample of tobacco retailers and
produce a compliance rate which indicates the percentage
of merchants in compliance (with a 95% confidence inter-
val of no more than +/- 3%). State protocols vary in
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:107 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/107

aspects that influence the measured rate of compliance
such as the age of the youths and whether they offer proof
of age [36-38]. The first year in which all states collected
compliance data was 1997 [39]. Compliance data were
obtained from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention
[39]. Eight compliance variables were created: 7 for the
federal fiscal years 1997­2003, and 1 for the 7-year aver-
age.
Price
The Tax Burden on Tobacco provides quarterly prices
(including taxes), by state, adjusted for inflation to 1983
dollars [32]. Since youths rarely purchase generic
brands,[35] the price with generics excluded was used.
The average price was computed for the 12 months pre-
ceding the MTF survey in the 2nd quarter of each year.
Eight variables were created, one for each year from 1997­
2003, and one for the 7-year average.
Restaurant Smoking Policies
State restaurant smoking policy data were obtained from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [31]. Too
few states had banned restaurant smoking by 2003, so a
policy variable was created for each year, such that any
statewide restriction on restaurant smoking was assigned
a value of 1 and no restrictions, a zero. An eighth variable
represented the 7-year average. We did not include local
restrictions on restaurant smoking as only 1% of the
national population were covered by such ordinances
during the study period (compared to over 50% for state
level regulations), and the completeness of the available
databases could not be verified [40].
Anti-Tobacco Media Exposure
The American Legacy Foundation graciously shared data
concerning expenditures in each of 200 designated market
areas in the U.S. for their national anti-tobacco media
campaign for each year from 2000 to 2003. Market buys
were used as an indirect measure of exposure to the cam-
paign. Four variables were computed representing spend-
ing in each of the four years, plus a fifth variable, the four-
year average.
Statistical Analyses
For all analyses the outcome was smoking by individual
subjects (ever used tobacco, or daily smoking). Subjects
were assigned values for compliance, price, policy and
media variables based on the location of their school. Age,
gender, race, ethnicity and parental education (demo-
graphic variables) were forced into each logistic regression
analysis as independent variables because these have each
been identified as smoking risk factors in prior studies,
because parental education is a good proxy for parental
smoking status, and because states vary on several of these
factors [41]. Regressions were initially run for each annual
compliance, price, policy, and media variable individu-
ally. The 7 annual variables for compliance, or price, or
policy, and the 4 annual variables for media could not be
included together because values from one year to the
next were highly correlated and this created issues with
multi-colinearity. For example, almost all states had the
same restaurant smoking policy for each of the 7 years. We
next conducted a separate regression for each multi-year
average variable. As none of the media or policy variables
were significant at p < 0.20 in the preceding models, they
were not included in the final model. Thus, the final
model included 'average compliance', 'average price' and
the sociodemographic variables. All results were weighted
to provide a nationally representative sample. Analyses,
using Proc SurveyLogistic in SAS,[42] included clustering
by school (as state was not a cluster variable in the MTF
sampling strategy).
Ethics
Our analysis was exempt from ethical review as it was a
secondary analysis of de-identified data. The MTF study is
conducted in compliance with ethical approval from the
University of Michigan.
Results
There were 16,244 subjects of whom 99.4% were between
15 and 17 years of age (range = 10­18; mean = 15.6);
51.4% were female; 62.8% White, 16.7% Black, 11.6%
Hispanic and 8.9% other races. Smoking in the past 30
days was reported by 16.7% and current daily smoking by
8.9%.
The proportion of subjects in states with restaurant poli-
cies was 52.9% in 1997 and 53.8% in 2003. Between 1997
and 2003, the population-weighted mean compliance
rate for the 36 MTF states increased from 77.2% to 87.6%,
the standard deviation (SD) decreased from 8.76 to 4.61,
and the range decreased from 53.3 to 19.9, reflecting
decreased variability between states. Over the same years,
the population-weighted mean inflation-adjusted price
increased from $1.27 to $2.21 in 1983 dollars, the SD
increased from $0.17 to $0.32, and the range grew from
$0.74 to $1.38, reflecting increasing variability.
When average compliance, average price and average res-
taurant policy were included in a single model, the impact
of compliance on having ever used tobacco was not signif-
icant (p = 0.07) even prior to adjusting for clustering, so
subsequent analyses were limited to current daily smok-
ing. With all demographic variables included in one
model, the odds of current daily smoking was related to
increased age (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.28­1.56, p <
0.0001), decreased parental education (OR = 0.96, 95%
CI: 0.95­0.96, p < 0.0001), and white race (OR = 2.29,
95% CI: 1.95­2.70, p < 0.0001), but not to gender or His-

panic ethnicity. The 7-year average compliance from
1997­2003 predicted daily smoking in 2003 (OR = 0.98
for each 1% increase in compliance, 95% CI: 0.96­0.99, p
= 0.04). The 7-year average price was also a significant pre-
dictor (OR = 0.49 for each dollar increase in price, 95%
CI: 0.29­0.83, p = 0.007). Average policy and media were
not significant predictors of daily smoking among 10th
graders. When both compliance and price were included
together in the final model (table 1; adjusting for age, gen-
der, race, ethnicity and parental education), the results did
not differ from the models that considered these variables
separately.
Population impact
We performed a calculation to determine how daily
smoking rates would have been impacted by changes in
price and compliance that occurred from 1997 to 2003.
The odds of current daily smoking declined by 2% for
each 1% increase in average compliance, and declined by
1% for each two cent increase in average price. Using state
adolescent census data, we computed that the population-
weighted average compliance increased by 10.4 percent-
age points from 1997 to 2003. Given a 2% decrease in the
risk of smoking for each 1% increase in compliance, we
calculate that the odds of daily smoking were reduced by
an estimated 20.8% due to improved compliance. At the
same time, the population-weighted price increased by 94
cents, reducing the odds of daily smoking by 47%. So it
can be estimated that under the compliance and price
conditions pertaining in the U.S. from 1997­2003, price
increases had twice the impact as changes in compliance,
but both factors likely contributed to the lower smoking
rates observed in 2003.
Discussion
This analysis of national data covering 7 years indicates
that improvements in merchant compliance that were
measured in the U.S. from 1997­2003 as states complied
with the Synar Amendment predicted a 20.8% reduction
in daily smoking among 10th graders in 2003. Prior to the
Synar Amendment, compliance with tobacco access laws
was quite low [27]. Although a few states acted of their
own initiative, there is no doubt that the Synar Amend-
ment with its threat of financial penalties for states was
the prime motivator for most states to enforce their laws
[26,29]. This is the first study to document that the Synar
Amendment achieved its intended effect of reducing ado-
lescent smoking.
The current study adds to a substantial body of evidence
that demonstrates that improvements in merchant com-
pliance are associated with reduced daily smoking among
adolescents [43]. This is the first study to demonstrate an
effect of enforcement of tobacco sales laws on a national
level. This is important because of concerns that only iso-
lated rural communities could be successful in this regard.
This U.S. national study demonstrates that this approach
can be effective across an area encompassing wide geo-
graphical and demographic variety.
Several early attempts to reduce youth's access to tobacco
failed. Three studies of local ordinances found no impact
on youths' smoking [44-46], but these concerned very
short-lived, local interventions that failed to convince
merchants to obey the law. Other interventions discour-
aged smoking only among the youngest youth who have
the most difficulty purchasing tobacco [45,47,48].
Because the positive and negative studies implemented
different types of intervention, the positive studies are not
canceled out by the negative studies. With so many posi-
tive studies as cited in the background section, there is no
question that youth access interventions are capable of
reducing smoking among youth. The important research
questions concern what are the crucial components of an
effective intervention? To date, all successful enforcement
programs have relied upon the use of underage decoys to
attempt to purchase tobacco [28]. No other method of
enforcement has demonstrated effectiveness.
Inaccuracy in the measurement of compliance results in
misclassification of exposure status, increasing the risk of
failing to detect a real effect. Thus, the fact that compli-
ance checks conducted by decoys are a poor measure of
the ability of real underage smokers to purchase
tobacco,[49] that states used different aged youth and dif-
ferent protocols to measure compliance, that states have
used 14 different protocol procedures that might bias
their surveys to produce artificially high compliance
rates,[50] and that statewide compliance rates mask sub-
stantial variability in the compliance rates experienced by
youths living in different communities within a state, all
worked to obscure the association between true compli-
ance and youth smoking.
We did not see an impact of compliance on ever having
tried tobacco which declined by 28% between 1997 and
2003, about half the decline of 51% observed for daily

smoking [24]. Daily smokers are more likely to purchase
their own tobacco and would therefore be the primary tar-
get for restrictions on tobacco sales [8]. The lower rate of
decline in ever trying tobacco is consistent with the lack of
an observed impact from enforcement. Novice smokers
obtain their cigarettes by begging from friends and do not
typically spend their own money purchasing cigarettes
until they feel a need to smoke every day. Daily smokers
make most tobacco purchases and win friends by supplying
peers with cigarettes. Thwarting the sale of tobacco to youth
affects daily smokers directly and nondaily smokers mostly
indirectly as daily smokers become less willing to share
when it becomes difficult for them to purchase [8,51].
Several study limitations must be noted. The absence of evi-
dence for an impact of the media campaign may result
from design limitations as others have seen an impact from
this campaign using a well-controlled prospective design
[34]. We were unable to control for state expenditures on
anti-tobacco programs other than Synar compliance,
because no state dichotomizes tobacco control funding as
Synar/nonSynar. Controlling for total state tobacco control
funding without excluding funding for Synar compliance
would produce an obvious confound with state compli-
ance rates. The survey relied on self-reported tobacco use.
Our prior studies have shown excellent reliability in self-
reported cigarette smoking among U.S. adolescents [52].
Further limitations were our inability to control for local
programs or tobacco policies. The measure of media expo-
sure did not capture local or state programs. Since this was
a national study, it is unlikely that isolated local programs
could have impacted the results.
An unidentified factor associated with both merchant
compliance rates and youth smoking rates could produce
confounding. If anti-tobacco states were faster, or
tobacco-growing states were slower to implement Synar,
merchant compliance might be a proxy for attitudes
toward smoking. A state-by-state review of factors associ-
ated with compliance with the Synar Amendment from
1995­2004 did not identify any sources of confounding
[28]. Price is a barometer of state tobacco sentiment and
the impact of compliance was absolutely unchanged
when controlled for price.
Important strengths of this study include the large nation-
ally representative sample, and the long period over
which the impact of compliance was assessed. This is
important as several years of impaired access may be nec-
essary before effects are evident among older adolescents
[12]. The adjustment for price, restaurant smoking poli-
cies, anti-tobacco media campaigns, age, gender, race, eth-
nicity and parental education are additional strengths.
Enforcement carries a resource cost, so it is important to
consider whether the benefits outweigh the costs. The cost
per year of life saved for youth access enforcement in the
U.S. has been estimated at $660 per year of life saved (dis-
counted at 3% annually) for a program that costs $150/
retailer per year and results in a 10% reduction in the prev-
alence of smoking [53]. For comparison purposes,
Woodridge, Illinois reported an annual cost of enforce-
ment of $16/retailer per year [53]. The actual annual cost
to states of implementing the Synar Amendment is
unknown even to them, [53] but if we allow for a gener-
ous education and enforcement budget of $150/tobacco
retailer for a state-run program, our calculated 20.8%
reduction in the odds of current smoking equates to a cost
of $330 per year of life saved. This compares favorably to
the cost of colorectal cancer screening at $10,000­
$25,000,[54] or annual mammography for women ages
40 to 80 at $40,000 per year of life saved, all discounted
at 3% annually [55]. For developing countries with lim-
ited resources, enforcement of tobacco sales laws presents
an attractive, low-cost approach to saving lives. Almost
the entire cost of an enforcement program is labor, so in
countries with lower labor costs than the U.S., the
expenses will be much lower than those used for these cal-
culations.
Conclusion
Our data indicate that improving merchant compliance
with the prohibition on sales of tobacco to minors and
increasing the price of cigarettes discourage youth smok-
ing. Our data suggest that an absolute increase in com-
pliance of 25 percentage points has about the same
deterrent effect as increasing the price by $2.00 in 2006
dollars ($1.00 in 1983 dollars). But there is no reason
why policy makers should choose between these
approaches, as all effective measures to reduce smoking
among youth should be employed. The revenue gener-
ated by a two-cent per pack tax on cigarettes would be
sufficient to fully fund a comprehensive enforcement
program [53]. The World Health Organization Frame-
work Convention on Tobacco Control recommends that
states raise prices and enforce restrictions on the sale of
tobacco to minors [23]. Ours is the first study to demon-
strate that such a program can be effective on a national
level to reduce smoking.
