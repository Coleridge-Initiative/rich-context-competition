Abstract
Background: Although diet and activity are key factors in the obesity epidemic, laboratory studies suggest that
endocrine disrupting chemicals may also affect obesity.
Methods: We analyzed associations between six phthalate metabolites measured in urine and body mass index
(BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
participants aged 6­80. We included 4369 participants from NHANES 1999­2002, with data on mono-ethyl
(MEP), mono-2-ethylhexyl (MEHP), mono-n-butyl (MBP), and mono-benzyl (MBzP) phthalate; 2286 also had data
on mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl (MEHHP) and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl (MEOHP) phthalate (2001­2002).
Using multiple regression, we computed mean BMI and WC within phthalate quartiles in eight age/gender specific
models.
Results: The most consistent associations were in males aged 20­59; BMI and WC increased across quartiles of
MBzP (adjusted mean BMI = 26.7, 27.2, 28.4, 29.0, p-trend = 0.0002), and positive associations were also found
for MEOHP, MEHHP, MEP, and MBP. In females, BMI and WC increased with MEP quartile in adolescent girls
(adjusted mean BMI = 22.9, 23.8, 24.1, 24.7, p-trend = 0.03), and a similar but less strong pattern was seen in 20­
59 year olds. In contrast, MEHP was inversely related to BMI in adolescent girls (adjusted mean BMI = 25.4, 23.8,
23.4, 22.9, p-trend = 0.02) and females aged 20­59 (adjusted mean BMI = 29.9, 29.9, 27.9, 27.6, p-trend = 0.02).
There were no important associations among children, but several inverse associations among 60­80 year olds.
Conclusion: This exploratory, cross-sectional analysis revealed a number of interesting associations with
different phthalate metabolites and obesity outcomes, including notable differences by gender and age subgroups.
Effects of endocrine disruptors, such as phthalates, may depend upon endogenous hormone levels, which vary
dramatically by age and gender. Individual phthalates also have different biologic and hormonal effects. Although
our study has limitations, both of these factors could explain some of the variation in the observed associations.
These preliminary data support the need for prospective studies in populations at risk for obesity.

Background
The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over
the last several decades in the United States (U.S.) and
Europe, and more recently in developing countries [1].
Although changes in dietary patterns and physical activity
are undoubtedly key causal factors [2], there is growing
interest in the possibility that endocrine disrupting chem-
icals, such as phthalates, may affect obesity-related path-
ways by altering hormone action or gene expression [3,4].
Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere
with synthesis, release, transport, metabolism, binding,
action, or elimination of natural hormones. Proposed
biologic mechanisms that could underlie an association
between endocrine disruptors and obesity include altera-
tions in thyroid and steroid hormone function [5,6], and
activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(PPARs) [7] which play a major role in adipocyte differen-
tiation and energy storage [8].
Phthalates are ubiquitous industrial chemicals used as
plasticizers, solvents, lubricants, and stabilizers in the
manufacture of consumer products such as children's
toys, medical equipment and medications, cosmetics, and
food packaging [9]. The general population is exposed to
phthalates by ingestion of food and water, dermal expo-
sure, and inhalation of polluted air [10]. Once taken into
the body, phthalates are quickly metabolized and excreted
in urine and feces. Lower molecular weight phthalates,
such as diethyl phthalate (DEP), are metabolized prima-
rily to their hydrolytic monoesters during phase I
biotransformation, whereas higher molecular weight
phthalates, including di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP),
are further metabolized to more hydrophilic oxidative
metabolites. Monoesters and oxidative metabolites can be
excreted unchanged or can undergo glucuronidation in a
phase II biotransformation to a more water soluble com-
pound [9,10].
Animal studies have found carcinogenic effects, testicular
and ovarian toxicity, and hormonal, hepatic, and renal
effects following phthalate exposure [9,11-14]. While the
results of human studies are not entirely consistent [9],
several have suggested anti-androgenic effects [15-17] and
one reported thyroid function changes [18], both of
which may play a role in obesity and fat distribution. The
only study to directly evaluate phthalates and obesity-
related outcomes in humans found a positive correlation
between several phthalate metabolites and waist circum-
ference and a measure of insulin resistance among adult
males[19].
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has conducted biomonitoring on random samples
of approximately one-third of the total National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) popula-
tion since 1999. Over 100 environmental chemicals,
including phthalate metabolites, have been measured in
blood and/or urine, and are publicly available for the
years 1999­2002 [10]. In this analysis, we examined the
relationship between six urinary phthalate metabolites
and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference
(WC) in male and female subjects, aged 6­80 years, who
were participants in NHANES during 1999­2002. Because
both body size and hormonal processes vary substantially
with age and gender, we conducted stratified analyses
within eight age/gender subgroups (6­11, 12­19, 20­59,
and 60­80 years).
Methods
NHANES is a nationally representative random sample of
the non-institutionalized U.S. civilian population selected
using a complex multistage probability sampling design.
Since 1999, NHANES has enrolled approximately 5000
subjects each year. In-home interviews and physical exam-
inations in a mobile exam unit are used to assess behavio-
ral and physical risk factors and characteristics. NHANES
obtained written informed consent from all participants,
and all data are available on the NHANES website in a de-
identified form. Details regarding questionnaires, physi-
cal examination components, and testing procedures are
available elsewhere [20].
A total of 5149 participants, aged 6 and older, had phtha-
late measurements and data on BMI and WC. We
excluded participants who reported dialysis (n = 4), chem-
otherapy (n = 8), insulin treatment (n = 64), pregnancy (n
= 204), or breastfeeding (n = 39) because of associations
with BMI or central adiposity. We also excluded 148 sub-
jects over 80 years old as weight loss commonly occurs in
the elderly. Finally, we excluded 313 subjects who had
missing values on one or more covariates.
Measurement of phthalate metabolites
Details of laboratory methods for measuring phthalate
metabolites are reported elsewhere [21]. Briefly, spot
urine samples were frozen at -20°C and shipped to CDC's
National Center for Environmental Health for analysis.
Metabolites were measured using isotope dilution high-
performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrom-
etry. NHANES measured seven phthalate mono-ester
metabolites in urine samples during 1999­2002: mono-
ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl)-hexyl phthalate
(MEHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-
cyclohexyl phthalate (MCP), mono-isononyl phthalate
(MNP), mono-n-octyl phthalate (MOP), and mono-butyl
phthalate (MBP), which represents the sum of two iso-
mers, mono-n-butyl and mono-isobutyl phthalate. We
analyzed four metabolites detectable in at least 80% of the
study population: MEP, MEHP, MBP, and MBzP. Several
additional metabolites were measured during 2001­
Environmental Health 2008, 7:27 http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/1/27

2002. We included mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)
phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)
phthalate (MEOHP), two oxidative metabolites of MEHP
that are detected at higher levels than MEHP [22,23].
Metabolites less than the limit of detection (LOD) were
replaced with the LOD divided by the square root of two
[10]. A total of 4369 observations were available for the
analyses of MEP, MEHP, MBP, and MBzP, and 2286 sub-
jects for the analyses of MEHHP and MEOHP.
Anthropometric variables
NHANES measured weight, height, and WC during the
physical examination according to a standard protocol
[24]. We used BMI as a measure of overall obesity and WC
as an indicator of central adiposity, which may be more
strongly related to health than BMI [25].
Diet, exercise, and other potential confounding variables
Dietary variables
NHANES assessed diet with a 24-hour recall using a com-
puter-assisted dietary interview. We examined the follow-
ing dietary variables as potential confounders of the
relation between phthalates and obesity/central obesity:
(1) energy intake; (2) energy-adjusted macronutrient
intakes (total fat, saturated fat, carbohydrates, and pro-
tein); (3) grams of fiber per 1000 kilocalories; (4) daily
servings in each of the five major U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) Food Pyramid categories [26] (dairy, fruit,
grains, vegetables, and meat); and (5) discretionary fat
and added sugars as defined by the USDA Food Pyramid.
Physical activity
Physical activity was assessed for subjects aged 12 and
older with a standard leisure time activity questionnaire.
Estimated energy expenditure was derived by applying
metabolic equivalent (MET) levels to reported frequencies
of activities. We also investigated confounding effects of
physical activity using other variables, including a dichot-
omous variable for leisure time physical activity; average
minutes/day of leisure activity; a variable which asked
respondents whether their activity was greater, the same,
or less than others their age; and an index which com-
bined several leisure and non-leisure time activity varia-
bles.
We estimated sedentary behavior by hours spent watching
television, playing video games, and using a computer
outside of work. Parents provided information on their
children's behavior during the past 24-hour time period;
adolescents (aged 12­19) and adults reported their usual
daily habits over the past month.
Demographic variables
NHANES collected data on race/ethnicity, education, and
family income during the home interview. Education
level was categorized as less than high school, high school
diploma, and more than high school. We used three alter-
native approaches to examine potential confounding
effects of socio-economic status (SES): self-reported total
family income; the poverty-income ratio (PIR, a ratio of
U.S. Census-defined poverty level to family income); and
a dichotomous indicator which combined several socioe-
conomic variables. The indicator variable first used
income, if available, to categorize participants as lower
SES if their income was less than or equal to $20,000. If
data on income were missing, education was used to clas-
sify participants (aged 19 and older) as low SES if they had
less than high school education. If both income and edu-
cation were missing, evidence of food insecurity among
parents or children (e.g., use of food stamps, insufficient
food for parents or children) was used to classify subjects
as low SES.
Smoking and alcohol consumption
Information on smoking and alcohol consumption was
available for adults aged 20 and older. Based on informa-
tion reported in the home interview, we classified subjects
as current, former, or never smokers. We categorized alco-
hol consumption habits (during the prior month) as
none, < 1 drink per week, 1­<4 drinks per week, 4­<8
drinks per week, or 8 or more drinks per week.
Menopausal status and parity
We used questions on menstrual history to categorize
women aged 20 and older as pre- or postmenopausal.
Women who were still having regular menstrual cycles
(not due to hormone replacement therapy) were consid-
ered premenopausal. We classified women as postmeno-
pausal if they had not had a menstrual period for  12
months or had had a hysterectomy. Women whose status
was unclear were assigned missing values. Parity was cate-
gorized into nulliparous, one live birth, or more than one
live birth.
Statistical analysis
We carried out gender specific analyses within four age
strata: 6­11, 12­19, 20­59, and 60­80 years. We used a
locally weighted regression smoother (LOESS) [27] to
examine the shape of the relationship between each
phthalate as a continuous variable and BMI or WC. As
these analyses did not identify natural cut-points, we used
age/gender specific quartiles of each metabolite as the
exposure variables in multivariate models. We also cre-
ated quartiles based on the overall distribution of each
phthalate in the entire population aged 6­80.
We used multiple linear regression models to examine the
relationship between phthalate quartiles and BMI and
WC controlling for potential confounding variables. We
included age, creatinine, race/ethnicity, height, and SES as
Environmental Health 2008, 7:27 http://www.ehjournal.net/content/7/1/27

core covariates in all models. Age was modeled continu-
ously in children aged 6­11 and adolescents aged 12­19,
and categorically (by 10 year age group) in adults. As rec-
ommended by Barr et al, we included creatinine as an
independent variable in the model, instead of using creat-
inine-adjusted phthalate values [28]. We included race/
ethnicity and SES because of relationships with both
phthalates [10,29] and BMI and WC [30,31]. As there
were no important differences between the three SES var-
iables described above, we selected the dichotomous var-
iable for the final models because it had the fewest
missing values. In general, there appeared to be very little
confounding by the remaining variables that were evalu-
ated. In order to simplify the presentation and interpreta-
tion of the data, other potential confounders were
retained in all of the models for which they were available
if their inclusion led to meaningful changes in the expo-
sure effect estimates (>10%) or if they were significant
predictors in any of the age and gender subgroup models.
Variables included in the final models were percent of cal-
ories from total fat (<30, 30-<38, 38+), servings of dairy
(tertiles), servings of fruits and vegetables (tertiles),
METS/month, TV/video/computer use, smoking (aged
20+), menopausal status, and parity (females aged 20+).
We also ran models stratifying by menopausal status in
women aged 20­80. Neither alcohol consumption nor
education had meaningful effects on the phthalate esti-
mates. Tests for trend were performed by treating phtha-
late category as a linear predictor in the models.
In evaluating the relationship between MEHP and the
outcomes, we ran models that included MEHP's oxidative
metabolites separately as covariates in addition to the
standard model described above. Hauser [32] and Meeker
[18] used this method to address potential individual dif-
ferences in metabolism of DEHP. We also created a varia-
ble for the percent of DEHP that was excreted as MEHP, as
described by Hauser (%MEHP) [32]. This involved con-
verting the urinary levels of MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP
to nanomoles per milliliter, dividing MEHP by the sum of
MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP, and multiplying by 100.
SAS version 9.1 was used for all analyses. We used Proc
Surveyreg to calculate adjusted mean differences in BMI
and WC accounting for stratification by geography and
the proportion of minority populations and clustering
within primary sampling units. We adjusted for the cov-
ariates representing the over-sampled subgroups rather
than using sampling weights; this adjustment is regarded
as a good compromise between efficiency and bias
[33,34].
Results
Tables 1 and 2 present summary statistics for measures of
obesity, exposure, and covariates by age, for females and
males, respectively. Phthalates were detected in most par-
ticipants; MEP and MBP were detected in greater than
99%, MBzP and MEHHP in 98%, MEOHP in 97%, and
MEHP in 81% of the study sample. MEP was detected at
the highest levels in all subgroups. Females had higher
levels of all metabolites than males. Except for MEP, levels
of phthalates were highest in 6­11 year olds. Females had
higher mean BMI in all age groups except children,
whereas males had higher mean WC measurements. The
high proportion of Hispanic and non-Hispanic black ado-
lescents is attributable to over-sampling in that age group.
In general, phthalate metabolites did not appear to be
strongly related to diet. There was some evidence of a pos-
itive trend between percent of kilocalories from total fat
and level of MEHP and MEP. The medians for MEHP
increased from 3.3, 3.4, 3.3, 3.6, to 3.7 g/gm creatinine
across quintiles of dietary fat, and for MEP, from 147.5,
153.1, 150.3, 154.3, to 163.8 g/gm creatinine. There
were some suggestive inverse relationships between the
level of several metabolites and the percent of kilocalories
from carbohydrates. There did not appear to be important
associations between phthalates and the other dietary var-
iables.
Phthalate metabolites were moderately or strongly corre-
lated (Table 3). MEP had the weakest correlations
(r<0.26­0.38) with other phthalates. MEHP was strongly
correlated with the oxidative metabolites of DEHP,
MEHHP and MEOHP (r = 0.68), which were highly corre-
lated with each other (r = 0.98). MBP and MBzP were also
strongly correlated (r = 0.72). Creatinine was weakly pos-
itively correlated with BMI and WC (r = 0.01­0.18); corre-
lations tended to be stronger among females than males
except among adolescents (data not shown).
The associations between phthalate metabolites and the
outcomes, BMI and WC, were similar; therefore, we only
present the results for BMI graphically. Results for both
BMI and WC are included in Additional files 1 and 2. Fig-
ures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 present adjusted mean differences in BMI
(kg/m2) with increasing quartile of phthalate exposure for
five metabolites, separately for males and females. Results
of trend tests are included for trends with p-values<0.15.
The results for MEHHP and MEOHP were virtually identi-
cal (MEOHP not shown). We found no major differences
in the results when we used cut-points based on quartiles
derived from the entire study population; therefore, we
present the results for age/gender specific quartiles. We
also found no major differences in results when we strati-
fied by menopausal status in adult females (data not
shown). Tables 1 and 2 present the ranges for each phtha-
late quartile, within age and gender subgroups, and the
regression coefficients for both BMI (kg/m2) and WC (cm)
comparing quartiles 2­4 to quartile 1 separately by age,

along with 95% confidence limits (CIs) and the p-values
for test of trend.
Figure 1 presents results for MEP for males (top) and
females (bottom) respectively. A positive relationship
between MEP quartile and BMI was apparent for adult
males (20­59 and 60­80), and for adolescent and adult
(20­59) females. Most of the coefficients for MEP were
positive, with the exception of adolescent males (no rela-
tionship) and older females (an inverse relationship). For
adolescent girls, adjusted mean BMIs were 22.9, 23.8,
24.1, and 24.7 (p-trend = 0.03) with increasing quartile of
metabolite concentration, and adjusted mean WCs were
77.4, 79.7, 80.1, and 81.6 (p-trend = 0.02). The effect esti-
mate for WC for the highest quartile of MEP was larger
than all other variables in the fully adjusted model; the
next largest estimates were -3.1 and -2.9 cm for the top
two tertiles of fruit and vegetable consumption, compared
to 4.1 and 2.7 cm for the highest two MEP quartiles com-
pared to the lowest. The associations between MEP and
BMI and WC in adult women were similar, but less pro-
nounced; the adjusted mean BMIs among women aged
20­59 by MEP quartiles were 28.9, 28.9, 29.0, and 29.8
(p-trend = 0.14). There was some evidence for further
effect modification by age with positive effects for 40­59
year old females, but little evidence of an association
among 20­39 year olds.
Results for MBP are presented in Figure 2. There were sig-
nificant inverse trends between MBP level and BMI and
WC among 60­80 year olds. There were no clear trends
among children or adolescents of either gender. The pat-
terns in adult males and females were different, with sug-
gestive positive trends among males for both BMI and
WC, but inverse trends among females.
There was a strong positive relationship between MBzP
quartile and BMI and WC among adult males aged 20­59
(Figure 3). The adjusted mean BMIs from quartile 1 to 4
were 26.7, 27.2, 28.4, and 29.0 (p-trend = 0.0002). In
contrast, there was a borderline inverse trend among 60­
80 year old males. There were no major trends among
females (Figure 3), although the estimates were positive
among all age groups, except for 60­80 year olds.

MEHP was inversely related to BMI and WC in adolescent
and adult females (Figure 4). Mean BMI generally
decreased across quartiles among adolescent girls (25.1,
23.7, 23.0, and 23.6 from the lowest to highest quartiles
of MEHP, p-trend = 0.02) and among 20­59 year old
females (29.8, 30.2, 28.5, and 28.1, p-trend = 0.02).
Results were similar among 60­80 year old females. There
were no major trends between MEHP and either BMI or
WC among males, except for a borderline inverse trend
among 60­80 year old males. Results for MEHP were not
affected by including either of the oxidative metabolites in
the model (data not shown). The percent of DEHP
excreted as MEHP ranged from a minimum of 0.3 to a
maximum of 98.1%, with medians from 7.8% to 11.8%
across the age/gender subgroups. There were no major
trends using quartiles of %MEHP as the exposure variable,
although most of the coefficients in both males and
females were negative, indicating a generally inverse rela-
tionship between higher levels of %MEHP and BMI and
WC (data not shown).
Figure 5 shows the results for MEHHP, one of the oxida-
tive metabolites of MEHP. There was a positive relation-
ship between MEHHP and BMI among 20­59 year old
males, and a non-monotonic increase among 12­19 year
old males (Figure 5). For MEHHP, BMI increased from
27.1 to 28.8 between quartiles 1 and 4 (p-trend = 0.10)
and WC increased from 95.2 to 99.8 (p-trend = 0.08)
among 20­59 year old males. There were no important
trends in BMI or WC among females; for 60­80 year olds
the estimates were inverse, whereas they were positive for
children and adolescents.
Discussion
This exploratory, cross-sectional analysis of six phthalate
metabolites revealed a number of interesting associations
with BMI and WC, including several dose-response rela-
tionships. Once considered to be a passive organ for
energy storage, adipose tissue is now known to be an
active endocrine organ that secretes numerous chemical
signals and responds to a variety of hormonal signals
[35,36] and thus may plausibly be affected by endocrine
disrupting chemicals. Animal evidence and limited
human data suggest that phthalates have the potential to
affect obesity through several different biologic mecha-

particular has been shown to play a major role in adi-
pocyte differentiation and energy storage [8]; its? activa-
tion promotes the differentiation of preadipose cells into
adipocytes [37].
Our results showed a striking difference in effect between
males and females. The strongest positive associations
were seen among 20­59 males for MBzP, MEHHP, and
MEOHP. In contrast, findings among females varied by
metabolite, with some positive associations for MEP, par-
ticularly among adolescents, but inverse associations for
MEHP and MBzP. Variation in the effect of phthalates by
gender is plausible. Several phthalates, as mentioned, are
anti-androgens; lower free testosterone levels have been
found in males exposed to higher levels of DBP and DEHP
[16]. Higher testosterone is associated with smaller WC
and a better cardiovascular profile in males, whereas
higher androgen levels in females are associated with
higher BMI, greater risk for metabolic syndrome, and con-
ditions such as polycystic ovarian disease [38]. Therefore,
women with the highest levels of MEHP may have lower
levels of androgens or a higher estrogen/androgen ratio,
which could explain the inverse relationship between
MEHP and BMI. Our results appear somewhat consistent
with an anti-androgenic effect of certain phthalates,
although additional explanations may be involved, partic-
ularly for MEP.
In addition to the gender differences, the associations also
differed by age group. We found no associations between
phthalates and body size among 6­11 year olds, even
though this group had the highest levels of all phthalate
metabolites except MEP. In part, this may be due to the
smaller sample sizes in this subgroup. BMI and WC are
also highly variable in children by age and development
status, related in part to timing of the adiposity rebound
[39], which could result in less ability to detect effects of
external factors. Because metabolite levels are higher in
children (except for MEP), the lowest quartile of exposure
calculated by age group does not necessarily represent the
same low exposure as in other age groups. Even so, results
among the 6­11 year olds were substantially the same
when exposure quartiles were based on the overall distri-
bution of phthalates in the total study population com-
pared to the results based on the age/gender specific
quartiles.
We found mixed associations among adolescents and 20­
59 year olds. Different effects by age are plausible because
physiology and endogenous hormone levels vary by age
in both males and females, potentially modifying the
effects of endocrine disruptors. The observed associations
among 60­80 year olds were quite different. In general,
BMI and WC declined with increasing levels of phthalate
metabolites. These results are surprising and deserve fur-
ther exploration. It is also possible that a physiological
change in older people is related to both weight loss and
altered phthalate metabolism.
Only one prior study has evaluated the association
between phthalates and obesity in humans. Stahlhut [19]
also used NHANES data to evaluate the relationship
between phthalates and WC, along with a measure of
insulin resistance, in adult males. The authors reported
similar, mostly positive associations between waist cir-
cumference and several phthalates in adult males. Results
for children, adolescents, and females were not reported.
There were some differences in analytic approach; for
example, Stahlhut evaluated all males aged 18 and older,
whereas we evaluated 20­59 year olds and 60­80 year
olds separately after noticing distinctly different associa-
tions in the two groups. We used quartiles of exposure
after determining that there were no clear patterns from
smoothed regression models, whereas Stahlhut used con-
tinuous, log transformed phthalate values, in addition to
quintiles of exposure. There were also differences in the
confounders that were evaluated in the two studies; in
particular, we evaluated a larger number of dietary varia-
bles in our models. The qualitative similarity of our results
for adult males with those of Stahlhut et al [19] suggest
they are reasonably robust to differences in analysis meth-
ods. The striking differences between males and females
revealed by our analysis significantly add to the earlier
work and appears consistent with endocrine disruption by
certain phthalates.
Strengths of our study include the broad range of expo-
sures, relatively good statistical power even within sub-
groups, and detailed evaluation of available potential
confounding variables. The ability to evaluate effect mod-
ification by age and gender was critical as we saw striking
differences in results by these variables. We tested multi-
ple dietary factors, four different measures of physical
activity, and three alternative measures of SES. We also
evaluated the data using exposure quartiles based on the
entire study population in addition to age/gender derived
quartiles of exposure, and found that the results were not
materially changed.

Our study has several important limitations. Its cross-sec-
tional nature precludes the ability to make any causal
inferences about the direction of the association between
phthalates and obesity. Although phthalates are rapidly
metabolized and do not accumulate in adipose tissue, it is
unknown if heavier individuals metabolize phthalates
differently than do individuals with less body fat. Elevated
exposures to phthalates have been reported due to use of
certain medications [40], and it is possible that some of
our results may be due to greater use of medications
among heavier individuals. It is also possible that our
results, particularly for MEP, may be due to greater use of
lotions and cosmetics in people with a larger body surface
area, resulting in a higher internal and excreted dose.
However, due to the multiple environmental sources of
DEP, this seems unlikely.
We controlled for numerous confounding variables,
including diet and physical activity. However, diet was
measured using a 24-hour recall, which has limitations for
estimating long-term dietary patterns, and physical activ-
ity was measured over the 30 days prior to the interview,
which may not reflect long-term patterns. Although
NHANES collects data on a wide variety of potential con-
founders, there may be other unknown or unmeasured
confounders. Some of our findings may be due to chance,
as we evaluated associations between six phthalate metab-
olites and two outcomes in eight population sub-groups.
Exposure to mixtures of endocrine disrupting chemicals
may have different effects than single exposures [41]. We
were unable to examine combined exposures to multiple
types of chemicals because NHANES measured chemicals
in different population samples. While this dataset does
include measurements for multiple phthalates, it is not
clear how these exposures should be combined when
looking at the relationship between phthalates and body
size. Compounds may have different and even potentially
opposite effects, and multiple mechanisms may be
involved. While work is being done to look at cumulative
effects of phthalate exposure on reproductive tract devel-
opment [42], there currently exist insufficient animal and
human data to develop a good biologically-based expo-
sure index for potential effects on obesity.
Single spot-urine measurements of phthalates were used
to estimate exposure. Phthalates are rapidly metabolized
and excreted, and a single exposure measurement may not
reflect long-term exposure. Exposure sources may vary
over time based on dietary intake, use of personal care
products, medications, and other factors. Several studies
have evaluated the consistency of phthalate measure-
ments over time and, in general, low to moderate correla-
tion coefficients were found [43-45], although moderate
to high sensitivity to classify individuals into the highest
tertile of exposure has been reported [44]. Therefore, our
effect estimates are likely affected by non-differential mis-
classification and comparisons between highest and low-
est quartiles may be biased towards the null.
A final limitation of the study is that, due to its cross-sec-
tional nature, we could not evaluate exposures through-
out the life course, particularly the sensitive window of
prenatal and neonatal development. In utero and early
life exposures may be critical; they may permanently alter
gene expression patterns that affect metabolic processes
[4].
Conclusion
Our results are exploratory and based on cross-sectional
data, but suggest that further research on the potential for
phthalates to act as obesogens is warranted. We observed
several associations between phthalate metabolites and
BMI and WC that were not only statistically significant but
of magnitudes of clinical relevance. Prospective studies in
human populations are needed to evaluate prenatal and
neonatal exposures, and to look at exposure to multiple
endocrine disrupting chemicals.
