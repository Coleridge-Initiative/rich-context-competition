To determine national trends in mortality due to invasive mycoses, we analyzed National Center for Health
Statistics multiple-cause-of-death record tapes for the years 1980 through 1997, with use of their specific codes
in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 codes 112.4­118 and 136.3). In the
United States, of deaths in which an infectious disease was the underlying cause, those due to mycoses increased
from the tenth most common in 1980 to the seventh most common in 1997. From 1980 through 1997, the
annual number of deaths in which an invasive mycosis was listed on the death certificate (multiple-cause
[MC] mortality) increased from 1557 to 6534. In addition, rates of MC mortality for the different mycoses
varied markedly according to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status but were consistently higher among
males, blacks, and persons 65 years of age. These data highlight the public health importance of mycotic
diseases and emphasize the need for continuing surveillance.
Several reports, including some based on data from
hospital-based and population-based surveillance, have
identified upward trends in the incidence of various
mycotic infections [1­6]. In a report by Pinner et al.
[7] that compared multiple-cause-of-death data for
1980 and 1992, the rate of deaths in which infectious
disease was the underlying cause increased 58% (from
41 to 65 deaths per 100,000 population) in the United
States, and mycoses increased from the tenth leading
underlying cause of such deaths to seventh during the
study period. In another report, Selik et al. [3] found
that the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) had greatly increased mortality due to the op-

To determine national trends in mortality due to
invasive mycoses, we analyzed National Center for
Health Statistics multiple-cause-of-death record tapes
for the years 1980 through 1997, using their specific
codes in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision (ICD-9 codes 112.4­118 and 136.3). We report
the findings for the major systemic mycotic diseases.
METHODS
Multiple-cause-of-death record tapes from the National
Center of Health Statistics for the years 1980 through
1997, the most recent year for which data are available,
were analyzed. These tapes include information from
all death certificates filed in the United States. In this
database, a single underlying cause of death was re-
ported for each death, and multiple nonunderlying
causes (immediate, intermediate, or contributing
causes) may have also been listed. Causes of death were
recorded according to ICD-9 codes [8]. HIV infection

was specifically identified by supplemental codes (0.42­0.44)
that were introduced in 1987 [9]; however, since ICD-9 code
279.1 (deficiency of cell-mediated immunity) served as a proxy
for HIV infection before 1987, we used this code to extend our
search for data from the years before the introduction of codes
0.42­0.44. The specific ICD-9 codes that we used for invasive
mycoses were as follows: blastomycosis, codes 116.0­116.2; can-
didiasis, 112.4­112.9; coccidioidomycosis, 114.0­114.9; histo-
plasmosis, 115.0­115.9; and other mycoses (including alles-
cheriasis, aspergillosis, chromoblastomycosis, cryptococcosis,
mycotic mycetomas, phaeohyphomycosis, rhinosporidiosis,
sporotrichosis, and zygomycosis), 117.0­118.0. For malignancy,
we used codes 140­208 and 210.0­239.0.
We searched the database for deaths with any of the ICD
codes for the mycotic diseases in any of the 20 "entity axis"
data fields for multiple causes of death. In the context of this
analysis, deaths "from" a particular mycotic disease include
deaths for which there was any mention of the mycotic disease
on the death certificate (regardless of whether the mycotic dis-
ease was the underlying cause or a nonunderlying cause, such
as a contributing cause). Thus, any death due to multiple my-
cotic diseases that was listed contributed to the counts of death
due to each mycotic disease. The word "from" is used even for
nonunderlying causes of death because, according to the in-
structions for the United States Standard Death Certificate,
every diagnosis recorded on the certificate must be a part of
the causal chain of events leading to death or must have other-
wise contributed to the death; no condition should be included
that was merely an important cause of illness or disability and
did not lead or contribute to death.
To calculate annual death rates, we used mid-year estimates
of the US population, which are based on decennial census
data (Population Estimates Program, Population Division, US
Census Bureau, Washington, D.C.). To control for changes in
the age distribution of the population, age-adjusted rates were
calculated on the basis of age-specific data and using the age
distribution of the 1990 US population as the standard. The
sex and race rate ratios were computed with use of Poisson
regression and data unadjusted by age. We used the SAS System
for Windows, release 6.12 (SAS Institute), for our analysis.
We reviewed the contribution of all the mycoses as both
underlying and multiple causes of death. With respect to the
former, the numbers of deaths are largely underestimated be-
cause in this data set, a disease such as malignancy or AIDS
listed anywhere on the death certificate is preferentially listed
as the underlying cause of death. In addition, since there were
relatively few deaths in which an invasive mycosis was reported
to be the underlying cause of death, we limited our further
review of trends in mortality due to these infections to the
multiple-cause mortality data (i.e., the mycosis appeared an-
ywhere on the patient's death certificate).
RESULTS
The underlying causes of infectious-disease mortality are
ranked in table 1. In 1980 mycoses ranked tenth, but in 1997
they were seventh.
Multiple Causes of Death
All mycoses. There was a dramatic increase in multiple-cause
mortality due to all mycoses, from 1557 deaths in 1980 to 6534
deaths in 1997 (i.e., a 3.4-fold rate increase, from 0.7 to 2.4
deaths per 100,000 population), with a peak in 1989 (10,341
deaths, or 4.2 deaths per 100,000 population). Deaths from
HIV-associated opportunistic mycoses accounted for the ma-

jority of the increase. The trend in fungal mortality from all
mycoses associated with malignancy showed a very gradual
increase during the study period.
Mortality by age group. The trend in the mortality rate
for invasive mycoses has shown an increase in all age groups
(table 2). The highest death rates occur among persons aged
65 years (an increase from 2.7 to 6.5 deaths per 100,000
population). In particular, the death rate in the group aged
25­44 years, after a sustained increase through 1990, recently
decreased.
Mortality by sex. Mortality rates for invasive mycoses were
consistently higher among males: the rate ratio (male:female)
ranged from 1.6 to 3.2 (table 2). On the basis of data unadjusted
by age, after adjustment by year, the rate ratio (male:female)
was 2.82 (95% CI, 2.78­2.85). Thus, males had a marked rate
increase and were almost three times more likely to die from
fungal diseases. After deleting all records with an HIV code,
the rate ratio (male:female) found by Poisson regression anal-
ysis of the mortality data was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.49­1.54).
Mortality by race. Although there has been a marked
increase in mortality rates for invasive mycoses across all racial
categories, the rate increase has been consistently higher among
blacks: the rate ratio (black:white) ranged from 1.3­2.5 (table
2). Using data unadjusted by age, after adjusting by year, we
found that the rate ratio (black:white) was 2.31 (95% CI,
2.29­2.35). Thus, blacks were more than twice as likely to die
from fungal diseases. After deletion of all records with an HIV
code, the rate ratio (black:white) found by Poisson regression
analysis of the mortality data was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.43­1.49).
Region. The mortality rate associated with invasive my-
cosis rose dramatically in all 4 regions of the United States,
particularly in the Northeast (table 2).
Specific Mycoses
Opportunistic mycoses associated with HIV infection. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the trends in mortality due to pneumocystosis
and cryptococcosis. The trend in multiple-cause mortality as-
sociated with pneumocystosis has shown a marked upward
trend, with a peak in 1989 at 2.11 deaths per 100,000 popu-
lation. Subsequently, the mortality due to this mycosis has de-
creased markedly (a 71% decline). The trend in mortality for
pneumocystis associated with HIV infection has closely par-
alleled the overall disease trend, with a peak in 1989 at 1.71
deaths per 100,000 population, which subsequently decreased
by 73%, to 0.46 deaths per 100,000 population, in 1997. In
comparison, the trend in multiple-cause mortality associated
with cryptococcosis has shown a much more gradual upward
trend, peaking in 1989 at 0.67 deaths per 100,000 population.
Subsequently, there has been a gradual decline in the curve.
The largest percentage increase (46%) in cryptococcosis-related
mortality occurred from 1985 to 1986; from 1989 through 1990,
the rate showed only minor changes. Since 1989, the mortality
rate for this mycosis has decreased by 31%; the largest per-
centage decrease (35.2%) occurred in 1996­1997, from 0.46 to
0.30 deaths per 100,000 population. As demonstrated for pneu-
mocystosis, the trend in overall cryptococcosis mortality and
the mortality for this mycosis associated with HIV infection
were quite similar.

mortality rates associated with candidiasis showed a markedly
steady increase during the study period to a peak in 1989, and
this was followed by a gradual decline. Since 1989, the mortality
rate for this mycosis has decreased by 50%. The same trend
was evident among patients with malignancy-associateddisease
(data not shown). The rate of deaths from systemic candidiasis
associated with HIV infection continued a definite but gradual
increase through 1994; however, subsequently, the rate has de-
creased by 69%, from 0.12 to 0.04 deaths per 100,000 popu-
lation. The trend in mortality associated with aspergillosis has
demonstrated an almost exponential increase, peaking in 1995
at 0.42 deaths per 100,000 population. Since 1980, there has
been a 357% increase in the mortality from this invasive my-
cosis. Despite a continued increase in the mortality due to
aspergillosis associated with malignancy during the study pe-
riod, from 0.04 deaths per 100,000 population in 1980 to 0.15
deaths per 100,000 population in 1997 (data not shown), since
1995 there has been a steady decline in mortality due to this
mycosis associated with HIV infection.
The trend in multiple-cause mortality rates associated with
category "other mycoses" has shown a markedly steady increase
(329%) during the study period, from 0.14 deaths to 0.60 deaths
per 100,000 population. In 1997, the mortality rate for this
disease category ranked second only to that of pneumocystosis.
The mortality rate for the other mycoses associated with ma-
lignancy has shown a less marked increase (240%) during the
study period, from 0.05 to 0.17 deaths per 100,000 population
(data not shown). There was a slight decrease in 1997 in the
trend in mortality rates for the other mycoses associated with
HIV infection.
Endemic Mycoses
The trends in mortality rates associated with histoplasmosis
and coccidioidomycosis are given in figure 3. Despite smaller
numbers compared with the opportunistic mycosis categories,
the trend in histoplasmosis mortality rate has markedly in-
creased, together with a more gradual and less marked increase
in mortality due to coccidioidomycosis. The mortality rates for
each of these mycoses were similar prior to 1984, when an
upsurge in histoplasmosis mortality caused them to diverge.
Recently, the gap in mortality rates associated with these my-
coses has narrowed considerably, to 0.064 per 100,000 popu-
lation deaths from histoplasmosis and 0.055 deaths per 100,000
population deaths from coccidioidomycosis in 1997, which is
the smallest difference between these rates since 1980. Since
1980, there has been no change in histoplasmosis or coccidi-
oidomycosis mortality rates associated with malignancy (!0.01
deaths per 100,000 population; data not shown); however, both
the histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis mortality rates as-
sociated with HIV infection have decreased since 1994. Mor-
tality associated with blastomycosis was the lowest of all the
mycoses studied (the highest rate for this mycosis was 0.03 per
100,000 population), and no discernible trend could be deter-
mined (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Our analysis of mortality data confirms a recent, marked up-
ward trend in overall mortality due to the invasive mycoses
and highlights important differences between specific mycoses
according to both patient demographics and underlying im-
munocompromising conditions (in particular, HIV infection).
The exact burden of mycotic infections has been difficult to
estimate. There is evidence from a few recently published re-
ports on hospital discharge data that the incidence of mycotic
diseases (in particular, invasive candidiasis) has been increasing
during the past 2 decades [1, 2, 5]. In addition, reports have
suggested that mortality due to invasive mycoses has increased
recently [3, 5, 7, 10]. The 2 major factors responsible for the
Mortality Due to Mycotic Disease in the U.S. · CID 2001:33 (1 September) · 645
emergence of fungal infections have been the HIV disease ep-
idemic and the many advances of modern medicine (including
solid organ and bone marrow transplantation) that enable or
prolong the survival of critically ill and susceptible patients. In
addition, the aging of the population has increased the number
of susceptible persons.
A limitation of the death-certificate data included in this
analysis is the relatively small number of deaths found to be
associated with mycotic infection, overall. These data almost
certainly severely underestimate the true mortality due to these
infections because of failures to clinically diagnose mycotic in-
fection. A second limitation of our study is that only the in-
formation contained on the death certificate was available, and
we have no data on the validity of the diagnosis of mycotic
disease in these patients, which usually requires microbiological
and/or histopathologic evidence of infection. Despite these lim-
itations, the trends seen in our analysis should be generalizable,
and to our knowledge this is only the second study to analyze
trends in national mortality data for specific mycoses, thus
extending the initial observations of Selik et al. [3] with regard
to pneumocystosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis among
HIV-infected persons.
There is no ongoing national surveillance system for mycotic
infections. A major drawback to the establishment of routine
surveillance useful for guiding specific prevention efforts for
these infections is the insensitivity of the current diagnostic
methods and the requirement for culture and/or histopatho-
logic evidence of invasive infection. While newer diagnostic
fungal blood culture methods with superior performance char-
acteristics have recently become available, false-negative results
continue to occur for patients with invasive candidiasis and are
particularly problematic for patients with aspergillosis. More-
over, since the majority of these are opportunistic infections
affecting critically ill patients often at the extremes of age, cli-
nicians may be reluctant to perform invasive biopsy procedures
and instead elect to institute presumptive antifungal treatment
for these patients. The diagnosis of invasive mycotic diseases
is also certainly affected by the recent dramatic decline in the
national autopsy rate [11].
The major trends we found in mortality rates for all mycoses,
by age, sex, race, and region, reflect predominantly the dem-
ographics of the HIV epidemic during the study period. Spe-
cifically, multiple-cause mortality associated with mycoses in-
creased markedly among males. Deaths associated with mycoses
also occurred more often among blacks. In addition, the North-
east was the region with the highest mortality associated with
mycoses, which may be a reflection of both a concentration of
the US population and a higher distribution of HIV-infected
persons in this area. Of the 2 age groups with the highest
mortality rates associated with mycotic infection, persons aged
25­44 years probably accounted for most of the HIV-infected
persons. The other age group with very high (the highest) mor-
tality associated with mycoses was persons aged 65 years,
which is the age category most likely to have an increased
incidence of underlying diseases, including malignancy.
Our study found that during the period 1980 through 1997,
the trend in mortality due to HIV-associated opportunistic my-
coses increased to a peak in 1989 and has since undergone a
marked and steady decline. This trend is most dramatic for
pneumocystosis and to a lesser extent for cryptococcosis. Co-
incident with the onset of these declining trends was the in-
troduction of antiretroviral therapy and recommendation of
the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as routine prophy-
laxis for HIV-associated pneumocystosis [12]. Factors that may
have influenced the decrease in mortality associated with cryp-
tococcosis during this period include improved antifungal ther-
apy and the reduced incidence of this opportunistic infection
among HIV-infected patients that has been reported for
1992­1994 [6]. A further marked decline in these mortality
rates was observed after 1995 and may be related to the intro-
duction, in 1996, of highly active antiretroviral therapy, which
has proven to be very effective in prolonging the survival of
AIDS patients and decreasing the incidence of many of the
infectious complications (including mycotic infections) and
noninfectious complications of this disease [13­21].
When we examined the trends in mortality associated with
the mycoses not associated with HIV infection, invasive can-
didiasis demonstrated a marked and steady increase through
1989, followed by a steady decrease through the remainder of
the study period. The overall mortality trend for this mycosis
resembled that seen for the HIV-associated mycoses; however,
the factors responsible for this trend are unclear. Since we elim-
inated superficial mycotic infections from our analysis, the
trend we observed in candidiasis is likely to reflect only the
trends in candidemia and invasive candidiasis, rather than more
characteristic HIV-associated disease manifestations (orophar-
yngeal candidiasis and esophagitis). Opportunistic invasivecan-
didiasis is an uncommon complication in HIV-infected per-
sons, although a recent report on active, population-based
surveillance for candidemia in Atlanta and San Francisco, con-
ducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dur-
ing 1992­1993, identified HIV infection as an underlying med-
ical condition in 10% of patients [5]. Recent reports have
indicated that invasive infection with non-albicans species of
Candida may be emerging among a growing group of high-
risk patients, which may be directly related to the more wide-
spread use of antifungal prophylaxis in this population [5,
22­24]; however, these infections are generally considered to
be associated with reduced lethality.
As seen in figure 2, overall mortality associated with invasive
candidiasis was predominantly a reflection of mortality among
persons not infected with HIV. The trend in mortality asso-
646 · CID 2001:33 (1 September) · McNeil et al.
ciated with aspergillosis continued to increase markedly during
the study period. This trend is likely to be related to increased
numbers of persons at risk for the infection, due to advances
in modern medicine, such as bone marrow and solid organ
transplantation. A similar, even more dramatic, upward trend
was observed for the mortality associated with the less specific
category "other mycoses." While the causative factor(s) for this
upward trend is uncertain, it is likely to be similar to that
hypothesized to explain the trend in aspergillosis-related
mortality.
Among the endemic mycoses, the trend in overall mortality
associated with histoplasmosis is closely similar to those for the
HIV-associated mycoses, except that the peak mortality oc-
curred somewhat later than was seen for either pneumocystosis
or cryptococcosis. As shown in figure 3, a major determinant
of the trend in overall mortality from histoplasmosis was the
mortality from histoplasmosis in HIV-infected persons. While
the peak mortality associated with coccidioidomycosis corre-
sponded with that of histoplasmosis, the relative contribution
of HIV-associated disease was much less, perhaps suggesting
that the increase in mortality associated with this mycosis re-
flects recent increases in disease incidence, particularly in Cal-
ifornia and Arizona [25­27].
During the study period, approaches to the prevention of
opportunistic fungal infections have changed markedly, par-
ticularly for HIV-infected persons. Antifungal prophylaxis with
oral azoles has been shown in controlled trials to reduce the
risk for mucosal (oropharyngeal, esophageal, and vaginal) can-
didiasis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis in patients with
advanced HIV disease [28­32]. However, the routine primary
administration of fluconazole to HIV-infected patients is not
recommended because of the effectiveness of therapy for acute
disease, the low mortality associated with mucosal candidiasis,
the potential for resistant Candida species to develop, the pos-
sibility of drug interactions, the cost of prophylaxis, and the
relatively low incidence of these opportunistic infections in
HIV-infected patients currently [33].
Formulating effective strategies to improve the outcome for
patients with opportunistic mycoses not associated with HIV
infection, in particular invasive aspergillosis, has continued to
be a challenge to both clinicians and public health practitioners.
Making the diagnosis early enough to allow for initiation of
effective antifungal therapy has been difficult, and better diag-
nostic tools are needed to identify infected patients and allow
for institution of timely and effective antifungal therapy. Clin-
ical series have demonstrated a case fatality rate of 180% among
these patients, findings which have led to the use of presumptive
therapeutic approaches for high-risk patients [34]. Attempts to
limit patients' exposure to these ubiquitous fungal microor-
ganisms have included establishment of protected environ-
ments in hospitals, which are supplied with air from high-
efficiency particulate air filters. Such measures are extremely
costly, may be discomforting to the patient, and may be in-
effective if the patient leaves the protective environment. To
date, the efficacy of azole chemoprophylaxis for invasive as-
pergillosis has not been clearly established, but it may be rea-
sonable to offer itraconazole to individual patients at partic-
ularly high risk of developing this infection, such as allogeneic
bone marrow transplant recipients receiving corticosteroids for
graft-versus-host disease.
In conclusion, our data have shown a marked increase in
mortality associated with mycotic diseases--in particular,
AIDS-associated and other opportunistic mycoses--and high-
light the need for continuing surveillance for these infections.
Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate the mor-
bidity and better define the factors associated with poor out-
come in high-risk populations.
