Reducing the sodium-potassium ratio in the US diet: a challenge
for public health1­3
Adam Drewnowski, Matthieu Maillot, and Colin Rehm
ABSTRACT
Background: The 2010 Dietary Guidelines emphasized that dietary
sodium should be limited to 2300 mg/d, with a lower limit of 1500
mg/d for adults aged .50 y, non-Hispanic blacks, and those with
diabetes, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease. The potassium
goal remained at 4700 mg/d.
Objective: The objective was to identify subpopulations for whom
the 1500- or 2300-mg Na/d goals applied and to examine the joint
sodium and potassium intakes for these persons.
Design: The analyses were based on NHANES 2003­2008 data for
12,038 adult men and women aged $20 y. Persons aged .50 y,
non-Hispanic blacks, and persons with hypertension, diabetes, and
chronic kidney disease were identified. Mean sodium, potassium,
and energy intakes were obtained from 2 nonconsecutive 24-h di-
etary recalls. Historical analyses of the sodium-potassium ratios in
the American diet were based on NHANES 1971­2006.
Results: Among persons recommended to consume ,2300 mg Na/
d, ,0.12% jointly met the sodium and potassium guidelines. In the
1500-mg/d group, the guidelines were jointly met by ,0.015%.
Based on Dietary Guidelines, the corresponding dietary sodium-
potassium ratio was either 0.49 (2300/4700) or 0.32 (1500/4700).
Historical analyses of NHANES data by age-sex groups from 1971
to 2006 showed that sodium-potassium ratios were never ,0.83.
Conclusions: Joint dietary guidelines for sodium and potassium,
intended for most American adults, are currently being met by
#0.015% of the population. Extraordinary efforts will be needed
to meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. Am J

INTRODUCTION
Adult Americans consume too much sodium and not enough
potassium (1). Current sodium consumption is estimated at 2300­
4500 mg/d, whereas potassium consumption is estimated at
2400­3200 mg/d, depending on age and sex (1). The health
consequences of excessive sodium intakes and a high sodium-
potassium ratio are severe, leading to high blood pressure, heart
disease, and stroke (2­5). In recent analyses of deaths linked to
NHANES III data (1988­1994), higher sodium-potassium ratios
were associated with a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovas-
cular disease mortality (6).
Public health recommendations have stressed a reduction in so-
dium and a simultaneous increase in potassium intakes (1). The 2010
Dietary Guidelines advise Americans to reduce daily sodium intake
to ,2300 mg/d per person, with an even lower goal of 1500 mg/
d for persons who are aged $51 y, are African American, or have
hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease (CKD)4. The 1500-
mg/d goal applies to about half of the US population, including
children, and to most adults. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines kept
potassium goals at the current amount of 4700 mg/d per person (1).
To our knowledge, no study has examined the extent of si-
multaneous compliance with the sodium and potassium guidelines
using nationally representative data. A recent report from the CDC
noted that among persons aged $18 y with a recommendation of
2300 mg Na/d, 5% met this goal (7). Among persons aged $18 y
with a recommendation of 1500 mg Na/d, only 0.6% met this goal.
The CDC report concluded that meeting the Dietary Guidelines
recommendations will require new population-based strategies and
increased public health and private efforts (7).
The current hypothesis was that joint compliance with the
sodium and potassium guidelines by the targeted groups would be
substantially lower than the 0.6% observed for sodium alone. The
current research objective was to identify those subpopulations
for whom the 1500-mg/d and 2300-mg/d recommendations ap-
plied and to estimate their joint compliance with dietary sodium
and potassium goals, as based on two 24-h dietary recalls from
a nationally representative sample. The associated public health
policy objective was to determine whether the analyses of
published federal databases would offer insight into the feasi-
bility of the Dietary Guidelines themselves and their likely
adoption by the American public, given the current food supply.

sample was limited to adults aged $20 y with 2 completed and
valid 24-h dietary recalls. The following exclusions were made:
missing information on diagnosed diabetes, missing information
on taking prescriptions to control hypertension, serum creatinine
(needed to estimate glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), or missing
ratio of urinary albumin to creatinine. The final sample was
12,038 adults aged .20 y.
Information on age, race-ethnicity, CKD, and self-reported
hypertension and diabetes was used to identify individuals in
the population recommended to consume #1500 mg Na/d. All
respondents aged .50 y, who reported being non-Hispanic
black, who took prescriptions to control hypertension, who re-
ported being told by a medical professional that they have di-
abetes, or who had a GFR ,60 mL $ min21 $ m22 or a urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio .30 mg/g were included in the re-
duced-sodium group. GFR was estimated by using the Modifi-
cation of Diet in Renal Disease study estimating equation (8).
All other respondents were included in the 2300-mg Na group.
Self-reported hypertension and diabetes assessments were used
rather than clinical or laboratory measurements to preserve a
sufficiently large sample size and to keep the focus on in-
dividuals with known, rather than undiagnosed, diabetes and
hypertension.
For each survey participant, sodium, potassium, and energy
intakes were obtained from 2 nonconsecutive 24-h dietary recalls.
The average of these 2 d was the estimated intake used in this
study. This measure reflects less variability than a single 24-h
dietary recall, although the means are generally the same.
However, the second 24-h dietary recall is done by telephone and
systematically results in lower reported energy intakes (and
consequently lower nutrient intakes). Although the 2-d values
better reflect the true distribution of nutrient intakes, as compared
with a single 24-h dietary recall, they do not reflect true estimates
of habitual intake. They do provide an upper bound of the
proportion of the population meeting a given recommendation,
because intakes based on data from multiple days will have less
variable distributions. The current purpose was to estimate the
more optimistic upper bound for joint adherence to the sodium
and potassium guidelines from a representative sample of US
adults. Several studies have made the point that a low dietary
sodium-potassium ratio may be a marker of high intake of plant
foods and lower intake of processed foods (9). Examining food
choices characteristic of low-sodium, high-potassium diets may
provide additional insight as to how Dietary Guidelines ought to
be communicated to the public. All analyses of 2003­2008
NHANES data were conducted by using Stata 11.0 (StataCorp)
and accounted for the complex survey design.
Analyses of NHANES data for 1971­2006
Previously published results from federal dietary surveys were
evaluated with the goal of identifying any population groups that
came close to achieving the current recommendations. Published
sodium and potassium intakes for males and females aged 12­74
y, by age-sex groups, were based on federal dietary surveys
conducted between 1971 and 2006.
Details on NHANES I, which was conducted in 1971­1975,
were previously published (10, 11). NHANES II was conducted
in 1976­1980 and was based on one 24-h dietary recall. In-
dividual estimates of sodium added in cooking or at the table
were not available. NHANES III was conducted in 1988­1994.
The data on separate sodium and potassium intakes by age-sex
groups, based on NHANES data, were published in the suc-
cessive Nutrition Monitoring in the United States Reports (12­
14). Additional historical data came from the 2005­2006 cycle
of NHANES as reported in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (15). It is important to note that these sodium-
potassium ratios were based on aggregate as opposed to individual-
level data.

with recommended sodium intakes of 2300 mg/d and those
with recommended sodium intakes of 1500 mg/d are identi-
fied. The figure was cropped to exclude potassium intakes
.6000 mg/d and sodium intakes .8000 mg/d; however, those
persons were included in all other analyses. The recommended
sodium and potassium goals (solid lines) and the observed
dietary sodium-potassium ratio (dashed line) are also shown in
Figure 1.
The current estimate was that the recommendation to consume
,2300 mg Na/d applied to 49.7% of adults, whereas the
1500-mg/d recommendation applied to 50.3% of adults. Among
persons recommended to consume ,2300 mg Na/d, 0.12%
(95% CI: 0.043, 0.31%; n = 6) jointly met the sodium and po-
tassium guidelines. Among those recommended to consume
,1500 mg Na/d, 0.015% (95% CI: 0.002, 0.11%; n = 1) jointly
met the sodium and potassium guidelines. Because these values
are based on only 2 d of dietary intakes, they are likely over-
estimates (or an upper bound) of the true proportion in the
population who jointly adhere to the 2 recommendations. Thus,
the proportion of the US population to whom the 1500-mg/d and
2300-mg/d recommendations apply and who were currently
complying with the joint sodium-potassium recommendations
can be estimated at being between 0% and 0.015% and 0% and
0.12%, respectively.
A secondary analysis excluded those individuals with CKD
from the evaluation of joint adherence to sodium and potassium
guidelines, because it is recommended that this population should
be consuming a low-potassium diet (16). After this exclusion was
applied (n = 2177 excluded), the proportion of the US pop-
ulation to whom the 1500-mg/d recommendation applied and
who were currently complying with the joint sodium-potassium
recommendations rose from 0.015% to 0.021% (n = 1). The
corresponding percentage for those recommended to consume
,2300 mg Na/d remained at 0.12%. Even after this sub-
population was excluded, the estimates of joint adherence re-
mained extremely low, between 0% and 0.02% for the reduced
sodium group and 0.12% for the 2300 mg/d group.
Additional analyses addressed the correlation between so-
dium, potassium, and energy intakes. These data are presented in
Table 1. The correlation between sodium consumption and en-
ergy intakes was 0.81, whereas the correlation between potas-
sium and energy intakes was 0.72. Further analyses evaluated
the foods and beverages consumed by the individual whose
average 2-d intakes met the recommended guidelines for sodium
and potassium (Table 2). The 6 recalls that jointly met the
2300-mg daily sodium and potassium recommendations are
provided elsewhere (see supplemental tables under "Supple-
mental data" in the online issue).
Sodium intakes in the NHANES I data were in the range of
1473 to 3219 mg/d, depending on age and sex, whereas potassium
intakes were in the range of 1683 to 3287 mg/d (Figure 2). On
the basis of these aggregate data, the mean sodium-potassium
ratio was 1.05 (range: 0.83­1.49). The lowest ratios were ob-
served for older women, who had the lowest sodium and energy
intakes.
Sodium intakes in NHANES II data, also shown in Figure 2,
were in the range of 1903 to 4030 mg/d, depending on age and
sex, whereas potassium intakes were in the range of 1952 to 3510
mg/d. The mean sodium-potassium ratio was 1.14 (range: 0.96­
1.22). Sodium intakes in NHANES III were in the range of 2360
to 4783 mg/d, whereas potassium intakes were in the range of
1984 to 3451 mg/d. The mean sodium-potassium ratio was 1.24
(range: 1.01­1.49). The sodium and potassium intakes for 16
different age-sex groups in the NHANES 2005­2006 cycle were
published in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines (1). The previously
unpublished mean sodium-potassium ratio was 1.29 (range:
1.08­1.56). At no point from 1971 to 2006 did any age or sex
group come close to jointly adhering to the current sodium and
potassium recommendations.
DISCUSSION
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommend that Americans
simultaneously reduce sodium and increase potassium intakes.
This is the first report to address simultaneous compliance with
the published sodium and potassium goals. Estimates of com-
pliance with the 1500-mg/d and 2300-mg/d sodium goals alone
were published by the CDC only recently (7).
The current analyses of NHANES 2003­2008 data used age,
sex, race-ethnicity, and health status to distinguish between
those adults to whom the 1500-mg/d goal applied and those to
whom the 2300-mg/d goal applied. The estimated joint com-
pliance in the first group (1500 mg/d) was 0.015%. The esti-
mated joint compliance in the second group (2300 mg/d) was
0.12%. Because the estimates were based on two 24-h dietary
recalls as opposed to habitual intakes, they represent upper bounds.
In other words, the true joint compliance with the published
sodium and potassium guidelines by the American population
was between 0% and 0.015%
To comply with the Dietary Guidelines, sodium intakes would
need to decrease by two-thirds from existing intakes, whereas
potassium intakes would need to double. This will not be easy,
given that both potassium and sodium intakes are closely tied to
energy consumption (r = 0.72 for potassium and r = 0.81 for
sodium observed here) (17). Young adults with high energy
intakes may be able to consume adequate potassium but may not
be able to reduce energy intakes sufficiently to meet the low-
sodium goals. In contrast, older adults with low energy intakes
may meet the low-sodium goals but will not reach adequate
potassium levels. To complicate matters further, potassium and
sodium are sometimes contained in the same foods (18, 19).
It is a potential problem that the potassium and sodium goals
were formulated in terms of milligrams per person per day, re-
gardless of energy needs. One way to address this issue is to index
sodium and potassium goals to energy requirements. Such
a nutrient-indexing model was used in 1999 for the Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (20). The 2010
Dietary Guidelines DASH eating plan indicates that sodium is to
remain at #2300 mg/d regardless of caloric requirements (1).

On the basis of published goals, the sodium-potassium ratio
ought to be ,1.0. Historical NHANES data from 1971 to 2006,
previously published in US Government reports, show that
even 40 y ago the sodium-potassium ratio was never ,0.83 for
any age-sex group. The feasibility of a dramatic 75% reduction
in the population-wide sodium-potassium ratio remains to be
determined.
Lowering the dietary sodium-potassium ratio by increasing the
consumption of potassium-rich foods can be a useful component
of dietary advice (21, 22). Increases in dietary potassium have
been shown to delay the incidence of hypertension (23). There
have also been proposals to replace the absolute potassium and
sodium goals with recommended sodium-potassium ratios (6, 24).
For example, the DASH eating plan is low in saturated fat, cho-
lesterol, and total fat but encourages the consumption of fruit,
vegetables, low-fat milk and dairy products, whole grains, fish,
poultry, nuts, and seeds (25). The diet was generally well ac-
cepted by study participants and has been shown to have ben-
eficial effects on blood pressure (26, 27) and on heart disease
and colorectal cancer (28, 29). Despite the effectiveness of the
DASH eating plan, adherence to the plan remains quite low (30).
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines stresses the importance of in-
creasing the consumption of potassium-rich foods. White pota-
toes, prune and carrot juices, tomato paste and juice, citrus
juices, beet greens, spinach, lentils, halibut, yellow fin tuna, and
bananas were listed among potassium sources (1). Recent
studies on diet quality and cost suggest that meeting dietary
guidelines for potassium was associated with sharply higher diet
costs (31). In contrast, sodium was not as sensitive to cost as
were other components of the 2005 Healthy Eating Index (32).
The selection of high-potassium foods may be influenced by
cost, taste, accessibility, and acceptability. Many people may
find it easier to achieve higher potassium intakes with com-
monly eaten foods/beverages, such as coffee, potatoes, and milk
than with some vegetables, fish, nuts, and seeds. For the 7 in-
dividuals who jointly met the reduced sodium and potassium
recommendations, coffee, potatoes, dairy products, bananas, fruit
juices, dried fruit, nuts, and vegetables were keys to achieving the
FIGURE 2. Sodium-potassium ratios calculated from published means by

potassium by different age and sex groups from 4 cycles of NHANES.

potassium recommendation, and moderate consumption of pro-
cessed foods aided in achieving the sodium recommendation
(Table 2; see supplemental tables under "Supplemental data" in
the online issue). Identifying potassium sources that are both
affordable and appealing ought to be a component of practical
dietary advice.
The current analyses point to the difficulty of complying with
multiple nutrient requirements simultaneously. The Dietary
Guidelines are based, in part, on food patterns that were de-
signed to meet sodium and potassium goals at different levels of
energy need (1). Linear programming, a mathematical optimi-
zation technique, offers an alternative approach to the creation
of food patterns that meet multiple nutrient recommendations,
while taking into account consumption patterns and cost con-
straints (33, 34). For example, very-low-sodium diets can be
achieved, in principle, by using high amounts of fruit juices,
nuts, and seeds and very few grains or meats. However, math-
ematical modeling, analogous to the Thrifty Food Plan, has
shown that the recommended amounts of other nutrients cannot
be met at that level of sodium restriction for some age-sex
groups. Notably, for all persons aged ,50 y, the 1500-mg goal
was not feasible, and no mathematical solution was obtained,
primarily because of the relatively high energy requirements for
this group (35).
The current study had some limitations. First, data analyses
were based on the average intake over two 24-h food recalls as
opposed to habitual intakes. However, recently developed sta-
tistical approaches that can be used to estimate habitual intakes
do not allow evaluation of more than one nutrient at a time on an
absolute scale or permit the identification of specific persons (and
diets) that meet the recommendation. As a result, our population
estimates represent a range from 0% to 0.015%. Second, all
nutrient intakes were based on self-reports and thus were subject
to underreporting or overreporting. Urinary sodium excretion is
the gold standard measure of sodium consumption, but it was not
available in this large nationally representative sample. Third,
sodium intakes from table salt and supplements were not in-
cluded, which indicates that the current values are underestimates
of actual intakes. Last, whereas all cycles of NHANES data have
relied on data from a 24-h dietary recall and excluded sodium
from table salt in estimating sodium intakes, the methods used in
these recalls (eg, nutrient composition tables to estimate intakes
and presence of additional queries relevant to sodium intakes)
varied from cycle to cycle (36). Even with the disparate and often
poor quality of dietary sodium measurements, it can be seen that
the sodium-potassium ratios were .1 (Figure 2). Combining
NHANES data from more recent cycles (2003­2004, 2005­
2006, and 2007­2008) is a standard practice, and the 24-h recall
methods are comparable. Despite these limitations, the current
data represent the best source of information on the dietary
habits of a large and nationally representative sample of adults
that informs the nation's food and nutrition policy (7, 10, 11).
The current analyses of federal data raise some final questions
about the role of feasibility research in the formulation of public
policy. First, the fact that the proposed sodium and potassium
goals are currently met by ,0.015% of the US population should
be an indication of potential problems ahead. Dealing with
99.985% noncompliance will be a challenge for public health
practitioners. Reducing the sodium content of the US diet may
be a challenge for the food industry (7, 31, 37). Preliminary
analyses showed that reducing the sodium content of all foods
and beverages in NHANES participants by as much as 25%
would raise compliance levels to 0.044% (n = 3) in the 1500-mg
Na/d group and to 0.3% (n = 16) in the 2300 mg Na/d group.
Future dietary guidelines might also note whether the proposed
goals are intended as realistic or aspirational. Ideally, cost and
feasibility analyses ought to precede or accompany the issuing
of dietary guidelines instead of following them by .1 y.
