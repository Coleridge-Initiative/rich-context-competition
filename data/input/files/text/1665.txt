Abstract
Objectives: The aims of this study were to compare prevalence of early child-
hood caries (ECC) in 1- to 3-year-old children seeing primary-care pediatricians at
two urban medical centers in Boston to the prevalence of ECC in similarly aged US
children surveyed as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) and to assess risk factors for ECC among this cohort of
children compared with risk factors among similarly aged US children. Methods:
Characteristics of 787 1- to 3-year-old children from two urban Boston medical
centers were compared with those of 3,644 similarly aged US children surveyed as
part of NHANES III. Demographic and social characteristics and ECC prevalence by
putative risk factors were compared. A multiple logistic regression model was fit to
assess putative risk factors and difference between groups simultaneously. Results:
Race, age, previous dental visit, parents' education, and household income were
significantly associated with ECC prevalence. Parents' place of birth was a signifi-
cant effect modifier with lower ECC among Boston children of immigrants than
among US children of immigrants. Conclusions: Lower ECC prevalence among
urban Boston children of immigrant parents compared with US children of immigrant
parents may reflect changing immigrant composition in the United States since
NHANES III or a different immigrant composition in the Boston area compared with
the United States. This finding reinforces the need for further research of immigrants
in order to understand cultural practices that may affect oral health. Finally, low ECC
prevalence among very young children reinforces the importance of early interven-
tion in reducing ECC.
Key Words: early childhood caries, oral health disparities
Introduction
Early childhood caries (ECC) is
the most common chronic childhood
disease (1) and is the most prevalent
unmet health need among children
in the United States (2,3). Untreated
dental disease can result in pain and
infection, impair speech, and lead to
learning and eating problems (4).
According to the 2000 US Surgeon
General's report on oral health, over
51 million hours of school are lost
each year because of dental disease
(5).
Healthy People 2010 has set a
target of reducing the proportion of
children who have dental caries
experience in their primary teeth to
11 percent or less in response to the
growing recognition of the negative
impact of ECC on quality of life and
overall health (1). Although ECC is
generally first noted in primary max-
illary incisors, it can rapidly spread to
primary molars (6) and often leads to
dental infection in the permanent
dentition (7-10). Because treatment
of ECC often requires extensive
restorative services that necessitate
the use of general anesthesia, treat-
ment of a single case of ECC can cost
up to $10,000 (11).
Good prevalence data are lacking
because of inconsistent definitions
of ECC, the frequent use of specia-
lized, unrepresentative samples (e.g.,
dental clinic attenders), and the
absence of very young children from
most study samples (12,13). The
available figures, however, clearly
demonstrate disparities in prevalence
of ECC: poor African-American,
Latino, and Native American children
have higher ECC prevalence than
Caucasian children (14-17). A total of
80 percent of all ECC is experienced
by 24 percent of children, primarily
from low-income families (3).
Virtually all American children
will visit a pediatrician several times
by 3 years of age, making pediatri-
cians ideally situated to play a vital
role in improving the oral health of
children. The American Academy of
Pediatrics established a policy in
2003 that every child should receive
an oral health assessment (including
caries risk assessment) by 6 months
of age administered by a qualified
pediatrician or pediatric health-care
professional (18). Along with identi-
fying general health problems and
screening for oral health disease,
pediatricians can advise parents on
risk factors related to caries forma-
tion even before a child's teeth begin
to erupt and include anticipatory
guidance on oral health-related

topics at well-child care visits. In
addition, a pediatric clinic is an ideal
setting for assessing prevalence of
ECC and its behavioral risk factors
among very young children because
virtually all children will visit a pedia-
trician at some point prior to 3 years
of age, while many will not have
seen a dentist or dental care profes-
sional at this young age.
The purpose of the current study
is to estimate ECC prevalence among
1- to 3-year-old children sampled
from pediatric clinics in two large
urban medical centers and compare
ECC prevalence among these chil-
dren with similarly aged children
who were surveyed as part of the
Third National Health and Nutritional
Examination Survey (NHANES III).
Material and Methods
Study Locations. Children were
recruited from two major medical
centers in Boston to participate in an
ongoing intervention study of ECC,
with one center serving as the test site
and one center serving as the com-
parison site. The Boston Medical
Center (BMC) pediatric clinic was
selected as one site to recruit patients
because of its mission to serve under-
served populations, including prima-
rily African-American and Latino
children. The hospital-based primary
care pediatric clinical program at the
Floating Hospital for Children is a
component of the Tufts-New England
Medical Center (NEMC), the other site
selected. NEMC is located 1 mi away
from BMC and serves a similar urban
patient population in regard to socio-
economic status and service to under-
served populations, although NEMC
sees a larger population of Asian-
Americans. Although the clinic popu-
lations vary in racial makeup, the
clinics are similar in that both serve
underserved populations, are both
part of large university-based aca-
demic medical centers that include
pediatric residency training pro-
grams, and are located in the same
city.
Subjects. Parents/caregivers of
1- to 3-year-old children presenting
for well-child visits were asked to
participate in the study. Demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, and behav-
ioral information were collected from
parents/caregivers who agreed to
participate in the study. A brief non-
invasive clinical examination using a
penlight was conducted by a trained,
calibrated dental hygienist at each of
the two sites to assess the presence
or absence of ECC.
For the purpose of this study,
only children who were at least 1
year old were included because no
information on oral health was avail-
able for children younger than 12
months from NHANES III. A total of
787 children, 610 children from BMC
and 177 children from NEMC, were
included in the current study.
All procedures, including forms
for informed consent, for the study
involving BMC and NEMC were
approved by the respective Institu-
tional Review Boards. Informed
consent was obtained from parents
or guardians of all children enrolled
in the study. All procedures involved
in the collection of data for NHANES
III were approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics Research
Ethics Review Board.
NHANES III. NHANES III is a
survey conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics from 1988
to 1994 based on a complex, multi-
stage sample plan. It was designed to
provide national estimates of the
health and nutritional status of the
United States' civilian, noninstitution-
alized population aged 2 months
and older. From 19,528 randomly
selected households, 33,994 sub-
jects were interviewed, 30,818 were
examined in mobile examination
centers, and 493 were examined at
home. Examinations were performed
by calibrated physicians and dentists,
and extensive health, social, and
nutritional histories were obtained by
interviewing the subjects or their
parents. Our analyses were restricted
to children at least 1 year of age up
to 50 months old, which corresponds
to the oldest child sampled from the
ECC study described above. All
NHANES children included had a
record for either nursing bottle caries
(applies to children between 12 and
24 months old) or a complete dental
examination. A total of 3,644 US chil-
dren from NHANES III were included
for comparison with the children
surveyed from two Boston urban
medical centers.
Definition of ECC. For the
purpose of this study, ECC is defined
to be at least one primary maxillary
incisor with a cavitated lesion, or a
primary maxillary incisor that is
missing or filled because of dental
caries. White lesions were not con-
sidered for this study because they
were not recorded in NHANES III.
This definition for ECC corresponds
to the definition for nursing bottle
caries provided for children between
12 and 24 months old in NHANES III.
Statistical Analysis. Weighting
was used to obtain population-based
estimates of US children surveyed as
part of NHANES III. Weights from
NHANES III were normalized for the
analysis in order to make the two
groups more comparable. To make
comparisons, children surveyed in
the two Boston urban medical
centers were grouped together and
labeled "urban Boston." Frequency
distributions for demographic and
social variables were tabulated for
both groups, and comparisons were
conducted by using the chi-squared
test of independence. Means and 95
percent confidence intervals (CIs)
were computed for dental variables
[the number of primary teeth pre-
sent, the number of restored teeth,
the number of decayed teeth, the
number of missing teeth, and
number of decayed and filled teeth
(dft) score] by group with compari-
sons conducted by using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). In
addition to making unadjusted com-
parisons using one-way ANOVA,
one-way analysis of covariance was
used to compare dental variables
with adjustment for age.
ECC prevalence was tabulated for
demographic and social variables
with stratification by group. Com-
parisons of prevalence between
urban Boston children and US chil-
dren for demographic and social
variable were conducted by using
logistic regression modeling with
testing for effect modification.
Early Childhood Caries in Boston Children 157
To evaluate the difference in
prevalence between urban Boston
children and US children, a multiple
logistic regression model was fit that
included all putative risk factors that
were significant at a = 0.05 level of
significance. Testing for effect modi-
fication was also conducted.
Results
Demographic and Social Vari-
ables. The frequency distributions
of selected demographic and social
variables were tabulated by group
and are presented in Table 1. The
distribution of urban Boston children
did not differ significantly by gender
or Hispanic status from children in
NHANES III. However, urban Boston
children differed in racial composi-
tion and age distribution from
NHANES III with a significantly
greater proportion of black children
between the ages 1 and 2 years
sampled in the urban Boston area. In
addition, urban Boston children were
significantly more likely to come
from lower-income immigrant
households with either no health
insurance or only Medicaid than US
children as a whole. However, the
educational level of the parents/
caregivers of Boston children tended
to be greater than that of the parents/
caregivers of US children. In addi-
tion, Boston children were
significantly less likely to have visited
a dentist or to speak English at home
than US children.
Dental Variables. In children at
least 2 years of age, summary statis-
tics were calculated for the number
of primary teeth present, the number
of restored primary teeth, the
number of decayed primary teeth,
the number of missing primary teeth,
and dft score by group (urban
Boston children versus US children)
and are presented in Table 2. When
comparisons were conducted
without adjustment for age, US chil-
dren were found to have significantly
more primary teeth, significantly
more restored primary teeth, signifi-
cantly more decayed primary teeth,
significantly fewer missing primary
teeth, and significantly greater dft
score. When comparisons were con-
ducted with adjustment for age, the
only statistically significant difference
detected was for missing primary
teeth, with urban Boston children
exhibiting significantly more missing
primary teeth than US children do.
ECC Prevalence. Overall ECC
prevalence among 1- to 3-year-old
urban Boston children was 3.0
percent, while overall ECC preva-
lence among 1- to 3-year-old US chil-
dren was 6.3 percent, although this
difference was not statistically signifi-
cant when adjusted for age (P =
0.158). ECC prevalence with stratifi-
cation by group was calculated for
selected demographic and social
variables and is presented in Table 3.
Overall ECC prevalence varied sig-
nificantly by all demographic and
social variables listed except for
gender. In particular, greater preva-
lence of ECC was noted among older
children, Hispanic children, children

whose race was not white or black,
children with a history of a dental
visit, children without private health
insurance (i.e., those with Medicaid
or no health coverage), immigrant
children or children of recent immi-
grants, children of less-educated
parents, and children from poor
households.
In addition to overall differences
in ECC prevalence, significant effect
modification was also detected for
the difference in ECC prevalence
between urban Boston children and
US children for the following demo-
graphic and social variables: a child's
history of visiting the dentist, health
coverage type, primary language
spoken at home, parents' country of
birth, and household income.
Multiple Logistic Regression
Analysis of ECC Prevalence. To
further evaluate ECC prevalence in
very young urban Boston children
compared with that in US children, a
multiple logistic regression model
was fit with adjustment for putative
confounding and effect modification
with the final model presented in
Table 4. Race, age, history of a child's
visit to the dentist, parents' educa-
tion, and annual household income
were all significant predictors in the
final model. In addition, parents'
country of birth was a significant
effect modifier. In particular, with
adjustment for all confounding, ECC
prevalence among urban Boston
children whose parents were born in
the United States was not signifi-
cantly different from ECC prevalence
among US children whose parents
were born in the United States [odds
ratio (OR) = 1.10 for US children with
parents born in the United States
versus urban Boston children with
parents born in the United States]. In
contrast, US children of immigrant
parents were over twice the odds to
exhibit ECC compared with US chil-
dren of parents born in the United
States (OR = 2.06; 95 percent CI:
1.47-2.88), whereas urban Boston
children of immigrant parents were
only half the odds to exhibit ECC
compared with urban Boston chil-
dren of US parents (OR = 0.49; 95
percent CI: 0.35-1.66), although this
difference did not achieve statistical
significance. In addition, children of
immigrants in Boston demonstrated a
significantly lower prevalence of ECC
than that of children of immigrants
throughout the United States, as rep-
resented by NHANES III (OR = 0.21,
95 percent CI: 0.08-0.61).
Discussion
When the distributions of demo-
graphic and social characteristics of
children sampled from two urban
Boston medical centers were com-
pared with those of US children, as
represented by NHANES III, signifi-
cant differences were detected,
especially with respect to racial com-
position and socioeconomic charac-
teristics. In addition, although the
comparison to US children was
limited to those in the same age
range, urban Boston children tended
to be younger than over half of the
children enrolled in the Boston study
being under 2 years of age. Of par-
ticular note, a significantly greater
proportion of urban Boston children
was found to be the children of
recent immigrants compared with US
children, with only 38 percent of
parents of urban Boston children

Early Childhood Caries in Boston Children 159
born in the United States compared
with 80 percent of parents of US
children. In addition, urban Boston
children were much less likely to
have private health insurance than
their US counterparts, with only 27
percent of urban Boston children
covered by private health insurance
compared with 65 percent of US
children.
Significant differences in dental
variables between urban Boston chil-
dren and US children were detected
when comparisons were made
without adjustment. However, when
adjustment was made for age, the
only significant difference detected
was for missing teeth, with urban
Boston children having significantly
more missing teeth than US children
do. One reason for this difference
may be misclassification because
unerupted teeth may have inadvert-
ently been recorded as missing.
Differences in the prevalence of
ECC among urban Boston children
compared with US children were
detected for a child's history of visit-
ing the dentist, the child's type of
health coverage, primary language
spoken at home, parents' country of
birth, and household income. In par-
ticular, the prevalence of ECC among
urban Boston children whose
primary language was not English
did not vary significantly from urban
Boston children whose primary lan-
guage was English (OR = 0.55, P =
0.166), nor did the prevalence of
ECC among urban Boston children of
foreign-born parents vary signifi-
cantly from urban Boston children of
United States-born parents (OR =
0.50, P = 0.093). This is in contrast to
ECC prevalence of US children of
foreign-born parents who had almost
three times the odds of having ECC
compared to US children of United
States-born parents (OR = 2.7, P <
0.001). Similarly, the odds of ECC
among US children whose primary
language spoken at home was not
English were over three times the
odds of ECC of US children whose
primary language spoken at home
was English (OR = 3.2, P < 0.001).
These differences between urban
Boston children surveyed for the
current study and US children, as
represented by NHANES III, would
seem to indicate significant differ-
ences in the characteristics of immi-
grants in the urban Boston area
compared with immigrants through-
out the United States.
Another characteristic where the
ECC prevalence among urban
Boston children varies significantly
from US children is health insurance
coverage. Urban Boston children
without health insurance or who
were on Medicaid were not signifi-
cantly more likely to have ECC than
urban Boston children with private
health insurance (OR = 1.1, P =
0.851). In contrast, US children
without health insurance or who
were on Medicaid were over three

times more likely to have ECC than
US children with private health insur-
ance (OR = 3.3, P < 0.001). One
reason for this difference in ECC
prevalence may be the larger propor-
tion of very young children in the
sample of urban Boston children
compared with US children sampled
for NHANES III where the distribu-
tion was evenly divided among the
age groups under investigation. This
contention is supported by an
increased prevalence of ECC that
was noted for the more comprehen-
sive definition of ECC that included
both white lesions and cavitated
lesions in our other work that
described ECC prevalence in the
BMC and the New England Medical
Center Floating Hospital (OR = 2.02,
P = 0.035). White lesions were not
included in the current study
because the operational definition of
dental caries for NHANES III did not
include white lesions. In other
words, without intervention, the
majority of these very young children
with only white lesions would be
expected to eventually develop cavi-
tated lesions as they get older, which
would then reflect the increased ECC
prevalence among children with
limited access to health care noted
for US children.
When all putative risk factors
were considered simultaneously,
race, age group, a child's previous
visit to the dentist, the educational
level of the parents, annual house-
hold income, and US children of
foreign-born parents were all found
to be associated with ECC. Children
whose race was other than black or
white had a significantly higher
prevalence of ECC than either white
or black children. These results cor-
respond to increased prevalence of
ECC among Asian and Hispanic chil-
dren compared with White and
Black children reported by Shiboski
et al. (17) Older children were also
more likely to have ECC, as
expected from the increased expo-
sure of teeth in the oral cavity over
time. Children who had previously
visited the dentist were also more
likely to have ECC, which supports
a study by Huntington et al. (19),
who noted a significantly greater
prevalence of ECC among Hispanic
children who had previously visited
the dentist. Among these very young
children, a history of visiting the
dentist is likely related to a child's
having already encountered dental
problems as opposed to parents
seeking preventive care for their
children. Educational level of
parents was also a significant risk
factor for ECC with a greater preva-
lence of ECC noted among children
of less-educated parents, which is
consistent with a study by Schroth
and Moffatt (20) that reported a
higher prevalence of ECC among
children under 3 years of age with
poorly educated mothers. Low
income was also associated with
increased odds of ECC, which is
consistent with a study by Hallett
and O'Rourke (21), who reported
higher prevalence of ECC among
lower-income households.
A particularly interesting finding
from the multiple logistic regression
analysis was the difference in ECC
prevalence among urban Boston
children of foreign-born parents
compared with ECC prevalence
among US children of foreign-born
parents. This difference may reflect
the different composition of immi-
grants in the Boston area compared
with immigrants throughout the
United States. According to a study
by Cote et al. (22), the caries experi-
ence of refugee children examined in
the Boston area varied significantly
by region of origin, with African
children demonstrating significantly
less caries experience than either
children from Eastern Europe or
US children. Reduced prevalence of
ECC among children of foreign-born
parents may reflect a greater concen-
tration of these African refugees into
the urban Boston population than of
immigrants throughout the United
States, as represented by NHANES
III. In addition, following war in
Somalia, Rwanda, and other areas of
Africa, there is likely a much greater
number of recent immigrants from
Africa since NHANES III was con-
ducted. Hence, the lower ECC preva-
lence associated with urban Boston

children of foreign-born parents may
also reflect the changing composition
of immigrants into the United States
since NHANES III was conducted.
Conclusions
When evaluated simultaneously,
race, age, a child's previous dental
visit, parents' educational level, and
annual household income were all
significantly associated with ECC
prevalence in both samples.
However, ECC prevalence among
urban Boston children of foreign-
born parents was significantly lower
than ECC prevalence among US chil-
dren of foreign-born parents. Lower
ECC prevalence among urban Boston
children of foreign-born parents may
reflect the changing composition of
immigrants into the United States
since NHANES III was conducted or a
different composition of immigrants
in the Boston area compared with the
United States as a whole. This finding
reinforces the need for further
research of immigrants in order to
better understand positive and nega-
tive cultural factors and practices that
may affect oral health. Finally, the low
ECC prevalence noted among very
young urban Boston children rein-
forces the role that primary care
pediatricians and other pediatric
health-care professionals may play in
preventing ECC through early detec-
tion and intervention.
