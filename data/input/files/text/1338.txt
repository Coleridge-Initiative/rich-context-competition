Abstract
ARDERN, CHRIS I., IAN JANSSEN, ROBERT ROSS,
AND PETER T. KATZMARZYK. Development of health-
related waist circumference thresholds within BMI
categories. Obes Res. 2004;12:1094­1103.
Objective: To develop and cross-validate waist circumfer-
ence (WC) thresholds within BMI categories. The utility of
the derived values was compared with the single WC
thresholds (women, 88 cm; men, 102 cm) recommended by
NIH and Health Canada.
Research Methods and Procedures: The sample included
adults classified as normal weight (BMI  18.5 to 24.9),
overweight (BMI  25 to 29.9), obese I (BMI  30 to
34.9), and obese II (BMI  35) from the Third U.S.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III; n  11,968) and the Canadian Heart Health
Surveys (CHHS; n  6286). Receiver operating character-
istic curves were used to determine the optimal WC thresh-
olds that predicted high risk of coronary events (top quintile
of Framingham scores) within BMI categories using the
NHANES III. The BMI-specific WC thresholds were cross-
validated using the CHHS.
Results: The optimal WC thresholds increased across BMI
categories from 87 to 124 cm in men and from 79 to 115 cm
in women. The validation study indicated improved sensi-
tivity and specificity with the BMI-specific WC thresholds
compared with the single thresholds.
Discussion: Compared with the recommended WC thresh-
olds, the BMI-specific values improved the identification of
health risk. In normal weight, overweight, obese I, and
obese II patients, WC cut-offs of 90, 100, 110, and 125
cm in men and 80, 90, 105, and 115 cm in women, respec-
tively, can be used to identify those at increased risk.

Introduction
Evidence supporting the use of BMI and waist circum-
ference (WC)1 measurements in the primary prevention of
chronic diseases is mounting. The use of BMI and WC in
predicting health risk has been recognized by the U.S.
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the NIH (1)
and Health Canada (2). The NIH and Health Canada clinical
guidelines for identifying and managing obesity indicate
that health risk increases in a graded fashion when moving
from normal weight to obese BMI categories and that within
each BMI category, individuals with high WC values are at
a greater health risk than those with normal WC values
(1,2). The current guidelines recommend that a single WC
threshold (men, 102 cm; women, 88 cm) be used to denote
a high WC, regardless of BMI category. These gender-
specific thresholds were originally developed in a large
sample of white men and women in which a WC of 102 cm
in men and 88 cm in women corresponded to a BMI of 30.0
kg/m2 (3). Thus, these thresholds were not developed based
on the relationship between WC and health risk; rather, they
were designed to be used in place of BMI as an alternative
way to identify those in need of weight management.

Despite these limitations, it has recently been confirmed
that the NIH and Health Canada WC thresholds predict
increased health risk within normal weight, overweight, and
obese class I BMI categories (4,5). However, at present,
there is no evidence to suggest that the current WC thresh-
olds are the optimal cut-offs within a given BMI category,
particularly given the potential redundancy between the WC
and BMI thresholds. Indeed, these cut-offs may not ade-
quately provide further discrimination of health risk, be-
cause few normal weight individuals have WC values above
the NIH and Health Canada cut-offs, whereas almost all
obese individuals have WC values exceeding these thresh-
olds (4,5).
Given that the WC thresholds currently recommended by
the NIH and Health Canada were developed based on their
relationship with BMI and not health risk and that these
cut-offs were not designed to be used in combination with
BMI categories, a critical re-evaluation of the utility of
using WC cut-offs within BMI categories is warranted. The
objectives of this study were to 1) identify the optimal WC
threshold within each BMI category for predicting those at
a high risk of future coronary events and 2) test the use of
these thresholds compared with the original thresholds
(men, 102 cm; women, 88 cm) advocated by the NIH and
Health Canada in a validation sample.
Research Methods and Procedures
Third U.S. National Heath and Nutrition Examination
Survey
The Third U.S. National Heath and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III; 1988 to 1994) is a nationally
representative cross-sectional survey comprised of a ques-
tionnaire and a mobile clinic visit, in which trained person-
nel collected demographic, health practice, and risk factor
information (6). During the clinic visit, body weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a Toledo self-zeroing
electronic digital scale (Mettler-Toledo, Inc., Worthington,
OH), and height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm while
the subject stood against a stadiometer. WC was measured
at minimal respiration and reported to the nearest 0.1 cm by
positioning a flexible anthropometric tape parallel to the
floor and immediately above the iliac crest.
Approximately 90 mL of blood was drawn from the
antecubital vein after a 6-hour fast for the measurement of
blood glucose and lipid/lipoprotein values. After centrifug-
ing, the resulting serum was used to enzymatically measure
total cholesterol (TC) through a series of peroxidase-cou-
pled reactions. After the precipitation of other lipoproteins,
high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was assayed
in a separate run with a Boehringer Mannheim/Hitachi 714
microcomputer (Indianapolis, IN).
Three blood pressure measurements were obtained and
averaged using the first and fifth Korotkoff sounds for
systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, respec-
tively. Smoking status (0  nonsmokers; 1  regular cig-
arette, cigar, or pipe smokers) was self-reported in the
questionnaire portion of the survey. The presence of diabe-
tes was based on self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes
(other than gestational diabetes) and from fasting blood
glucose levels obtained during the clinic visit. The study
protocol was approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics, and all participants provided written informed
consent before participation. The response rate for the clin-
ical examination portion of the survey was 78% of those
screened for NHANES III (6).
Canadian Heart Health Surveys
The Canadian Heart Health Surveys (CHHS) database is
a compilation of cross-sectional surveys that were con-
ducted within each of the 10 provinces between 1986 and
1992. Participants were identified through provincial med-
ical insurance registries and selected based on a stratified
random sampling design, according to six age-by-sex
groups. The survey included a home interview and clinical
component in which cardiovascular risk factors were as-
sessed.
At the clinic visit, anthropometric variables were mea-
sured with subjects barefoot and wearing normal indoor
clothing. Weight (in kilograms) was measured using stan-
dardized beam balance scales (Continental Scale Works,
Chicago, IL), and height (in centimeters) was measured
against a walled tape measure while subjects stood on a hard
surface. In the case of pregnancy at the clinic visit, self-
reported weight from the home interview was used in the
calculation of BMI. After a normal expiration, WC was
measured at the noticeable narrowing of the waist or mid-
way between the 12th rib and the iliac crest, when the
narrowest waist could not be determined (7).
The average of four blood pressure readings was re-
ported, using the first and fifth Korotkoff sounds to identify
SBP and DBP, respectively. Eight-hour fasting venous
blood samples (20 mL) were collected in Vacutainer tubes
and stored in sodium EDTA before centrifuging. The re-
sulting serum was sent to the Lipid Research Clinic Labo-
ratory (University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada), where TC
and HDL-C were assayed (8) in accordance with the Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Center for Disease
Control Lipid Standardization Program, as described else-
where (9).
The presence of diabetes (0  no diabetes, 1  physi-
cian-confirmed diabetes) and smoking status (0  non-
smokers, 1  regular cigarette or pipe smokers) was self-
reported in the questionnaire portion of the survey. All study
protocols were approved after an institutional ethics review,
and written informed consent was obtained from all partic-
ipants. Of those screened for the CHHS, 78% were inter-
viewed, and 69% of those invited attended the clinic (8).

Framingham Algorithm
The Framingham coronary heart disease risk index
(CHDRI) (10) is a primary care algorithm that was selected
as the health outcome in this study, from which WC thresh-
olds would be developed. The CHDRI is a clinically rele-
vant index of 10-year cardiovascular risk (recognized and
unrecognized myocardial infarction and coronary heart dis-
ease death) that is computed from age- and sex-specific
categories of SBP, TC, HDL-C, and cigarette smoking
status (10). Summary risk scores (range in men: 9 to 17;
range in women: 7 to 25) were subsequently assigned
and can be translated into a patient's risk of a 10-year
coronary event.
Study 1: WC Threshold Development
The purpose of Study 1 was to develop health-based WC
thresholds within BMI categories. To this end, data from
NHANES III were used. Participants were included in the
analysis if they had complete data for the calculation of the
Framingham CHDRI, as well as measurements of WC and
BMI. The sample was limited to individuals 20 to 65 years
of age (N  11,968), corresponding with the lower age
restriction of the Framingham algorithm (20 years) and
for consistency with current age recommendations (65
years) for the use of anthropometry in predicting health risk
(11). All pregnant women were excluded.
Framingham CHDRI scores were computed and dichot-
omized (0  low risk; 1  high risk) based on the projected
risk of adverse coronary events. The high-risk category
included participants who were in the top quintile (20%) of
the Framingham distribution in NHANES III (men:
CHDRI  13; women: CHDRI  14), whereas the low-risk
group included those in the bottom four quintiles (80%) of
the distribution of the entire sample. The Third National
Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel des-
ignates diabetes as a risk equivalent to coronary heart dis-
ease; thus, 757 people with diabetes (men: N  307;
women: N  450) were also included in the high-risk group.
It should be noted that all analyses were also performed
without people with diabetes in the high-risk group, and the
results were virtually identical.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
used to select the optimal anthropometric thresholds that
identified individuals at high risk of future coronary events.
ROC curves displaying the sensitivity (y axis) and 1 
specificity (x axis) of the diagnostic (WC) were used to
predict high risk of coronary events. The area under the
curve (AUC) is considered a measure of the use of WC and
the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for predict-
ing high risk coronary events. An AUC of 1.0 would be a
perfect predictor of those at high risk, whereas an AUC of
0.5 would be expected to occur by chance alone. The
optimal WC threshold was selected to be the point of
convergence between sensitivity (correct identification of
high-risk participants) and specificity (correct identification
of low-risk participants) of each curve. We chose WC
values one step above the point at which specificity ex-
ceeded sensitivity as the optimal threshold, rounded to the
nearest centimeter (12).
BMI-specific analyses were conducted to identify the
optimal WC threshold within normal weight (18 to 24.9
kg/m2), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30 to 34.9
kg/m2), and obese II (35 kg/m2) categories. All analyses
were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population
using ROC graphics (version 11.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) (13),
and inferential statistics were conducted in STATA
(STATA Inc., College Station, TX) (14) to account for the
complex sampling strategy employed in the design of
NHANES III.
Study 2: WC Threshold Cross-Validation
Once BMI-specific WC thresholds were obtained using
the NHANES III sample, sensitivities and specificities were
computed using data from the CHHS. For consistency with
the developmental study, the sample was limited to those 20
to 65 years of age within the five CHHS provinces (Ontario,
Que
´bec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; N  6286)
that measured WC. Together, these five provinces ac-
counted for 79% of the Canadian population in 1991 (15).
To ensure comparability across high-risk groups in the
Canadian and U.S. samples, the high-risk group was defined
using the same absolute CHDRI criteria as in Study 1 (men:
CHDRI  13; women: CHDRI  14). An additional 340
people with physician-confirmed diabetes (men: N  157;
women: N  183) were included in the high-risk group. It
should be noted that the analyses were also performed
without including those with diabetes in the high-risk group,
and the results were virtually identical.
SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) (16) was used for data-
base management, and all inferential analyses were
weighted to be representative of the population using
STATA survey procedures (Intercooled 7; STATA) (14)
that account for the stratified sampling design used in the
CHHS.
Because of discrepancies in the position of WC measure-
ment in NHANES III vs. CHHS, adjustments were made to
the BMI-specific WC thresholds before they were tested in
the CHHS, based on the results of Wang et al. (17). In their
study, there was a statistically significant difference (1.7
cm) between WC measured immediately above the iliac
crest (as in NHANES) and WC measured at the narrowest
waist (as in the CHHS) in men. In women, the difference
between measurement of WC at the iliac crest and narrow-
est waist was 4.6 cm. Thus, based on these average
differences, WC thresholds were lowered by 2 cm in men
and by 5 cm in women before applying them to the CHHS
sample to account for systematic measurement differences.

Unfortunately, information on race/ethnicity was not col-
lected in the CHHS; thus, only the general WC thresholds
from NHANES III were validated. Given that a similar (but
higher) proportion of the Canadian population (2001; 86%)
(18) consists of "white" or nonminority individuals com-
pared with the United States (1990; 76%) (19), we are
confident that the validation can be generalized to the pop-
ulation at large. However, where sample sizes permit, future
studies should be aimed at validating the ethnic-specific
thresholds.
Results
Table 1 describes the characteristics of study participants
in the NHANES III and the CHHS. Cardiovascular risk
(CHDRI scores), WC, and BMI measurements were some-
what lower in the CHHS compared with the NHANES III.
Compared with Americans, fewer Canadian men (10.6% vs.
21.1%) and women (12.5% vs. 22.5%) were classified at
high risk for future coronary events based on the cut-offs
employed in this study (men: CHRI  13; women: CHRI 
14). Independent samples Student's t tests show similar sex
differences within the NHANES and CHHS samples, with
the exception of BMI and TC.
Study 1
Table 2 presents the optimal WC thresholds for predict-
ing future coronary events in the entire NHANES III sam-
ple, stratified by sex but not BMI category. The optimal WC
thresholds were higher in men (96 cm) than in women (90
cm). The optimal WC thresholds also tended to vary slightly
according to age and race/ethnicity.
BMI category-specific analyses indicated that the optimal
WC thresholds for future coronary risk differed consider-
ably from the single thresholds proposed by the NIH and
Health Canada (men, 102 cm; women, 88 cm). In general,
the WC threshold associated with coronary risk increased
when moving from the normal weight to class II obese
BMI categories. In men, WC thresholds of 87, 98, 109, and
124 cm were identified as optimal thresholds across normal
weight, overweight, class I obese, and class II obese BMI
groups, respectively (Table 3). The corresponding values in
women were 79, 92, 103, and 115 cm. These thresholds also
differed slightly (5 cm) according to age and race/ethnic-
ity.
Study 2
Results of the cross-validation study (Table 4) indicate
that the greatest improvements in sensitivity between the
NIH and Health Canada cut-offs and the BMI-specific WC
thresholds were seen in normal weight men and women.
The balance between sensitivity and specificity (e.g., having
a relatively high sensitivity and a relatively high specificity)
improved in all groups. As expected, the sensitivity of the
single NIH and Health Canada WC cut-offs increased
across BMI categories at the expense of specificity, which
consistently decreased. On the other hand, the BMI-specific
thresholds had a balanced level of sensitivity and specificity
across categories, indicating that the discrimination of
health risk was improved.
Another way to compare the performance of the devel-
oped thresholds is by considering false-negative (1  sen-
sitivity) and false-positive (1  specificity) cases. For ex-
ample, using the single NIH and Health Canada WC

thresholds, 97% of normal weight men and women at high
risk for future coronary events would be misclassified. This
is substantial, given that only 34% of normal weight men
and 40.8% of normal weight women would be falsely clas-
sified as low risk according to the BMI-specific thresholds.
Similarly, the number of false-positive cases drops dramat-
ically when BMI-specific thresholds are used for obese I
(men: 75.9% vs. 40.9%; women: 91.1% vs. 27.6%) and
obese II (men: 90.3% vs. 11.7%; women: 98.2% vs.
28.3%) categories instead of the NIH and Health Canada
thresholds. Using category-specific WC cut-offs means that
more than twice the number of high-risk men (283 vs. 133)
and slightly more women (215 vs. 196) would be correctly
identified.
Discussion
The results of this study indicate that the current NIH and
Health Canada recommendations to use a single WC thresh-
old across all BMI categories are insufficient to identify
those at increased health risk. Independent of sex, the use of
BMI category-specific WC thresholds improved the identi-
fication of individuals at a high risk of future coronary
events. To simplify their use in clinical settings, the WC
thresholds determined in this study have been rounded and
are presented in Table 5. These thresholds can be used as a
simple clinical tool for the screening of future coronary risk
based on WC measurements within specific BMI categories.
Although these WC thresholds are reasonable guidelines for
the identification of increased health risk within specific
BMI categories, they should be considered preliminary until
further studies confirm our findings in other representative
samples.
The BMI-specific WC thresholds shift the prevalence of
individuals with a high WC, within a given BMI category,
compared with the single NIH and Health Canada WC
threshold (Figure 1). The high sensitivity of the single NIH
and Health Canada WC threshold within the normal weight
BMI category can be explained by the low prevalence of
normal weight individuals with WC levels above the pro-
posed cut-off, whereas the high specificity in the obese II
category is explained by the fact that almost all individuals
in that category have a high WC. Although the resulting
classification is impressive, the clinical use of the single
thresholds is questionable. In contrast, the use of BMI-
specific thresholds provides a more balanced prevalence of
participants with a high WC across the BMI categories.
A previous ROC analysis in the CHHS (20) showed that
WC thresholds of 94 and 80 cm in men and women,
respectively, provided the best compromise between sensi-
tivity and specificity for the prediction of a cluster of three
or more cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipi-
demia, diabetes, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle). After
adjustment for differences in the site of WC measurement
(men, 2 cm; women, 5 cm), the WC thresholds reported
by Dobbelsteyn et al. (20) are identical to those reported
here in men (96 cm), but differ by 5 cm in women (85 vs.
90 cm). In a sample of white men and women from
NHANES III, Zhu et al. (21) reported that the presence of at
least one obesity-related risk factor (low HDL-C, high blood
pressure, high blood glucose, or high low-density lipopro-
teins) is predicted by WC thresholds of 98 cm in men and 87
cm in women. These WC values are comparable with the
values we determined for prediction of future coronary risk
in white men (97 cm) and women (89 cm).
Few studies have reported ethnic- or race-specific WC
thresholds. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Commu-
nities study of incident diabetes in middle-aged adults (40 to
65 years of age) provide the most relevant comparisons

(22). In that study, diabetes was best predicted by a WC of
101 cm in black men, whereas in white men, the optimal
cut-off was 95 cm. In black and white women, WC values
of 99 and 101 cm, respectively, were the optimal cut-offs.
We also report similar WC thresholds from our analysis
(Table 2) in Hispanics to the WC cut-offs reported in the
Mexican National Health Survey 2000 (20 to 69 years of
age) for identifying diabetes (men: WC  95 cm, women:
WC  97 cm,) and hypertension (men: WC  94 cm,
women: WC  94 cm) (23).
In this study, the WC thresholds were lower in younger
(20 to 40 years of age) vs. older (41 to 65 years of age)
participants, with a 5-cm difference in men and a 4-cm
difference in women (Table 2). These findings are sup-
ported by the study of Dobbelsteyn et al. (20), who also
reported higher WC cut-points with increasing age for the
prediction of risk factor clustering. Once stratified by BMI
categories, the age differences persisted for normal weight
and overweight men and women but were attenuated in the
obese II category (Table 3). The adjustment of WC
thresholds for a patient's age has been recommended (24);
however, the clinical significance of such an adjustment
within BMI categories has not yet been established, given
the small sample sizes that would result from further subset

analyses. To accommodate age-related changes in body fat
distribution and cardiovascular risk, Dobbelsteyn et al. (20)
recommended adjusting WC thresholds according to 10-
year age categories. When stratified by age categories (18 to
24; 25 to 34; 35 to 39; 40 to 54; 55 to 64; and 65 to 74
years), the optimal WC cut-off ranged from 88 to 99 and 72
to 85 cm in men and women, respectively.
There were consistent sex differences in the optimal WC
thresholds across BMI categories. For a given level of BMI,
men had a higher WC threshold than women. However,
these values should not be used to interpret gender differ-
ences in the absolute risk of heart disease attributable to a
high WC. The optimal thresholds were obtained in sex-
specific analyses comparing participants at low and high
risk of future coronary events; thus, the thresholds represent
the best point of discrimination of relative risk rather than
absolute risk. For example, the Framingham CHDRI thresh-
olds used were 13 in men and 14 in women, which
correspond to 10-year absolute risks of coronary heart dis-
ease of 12% for men and 2% for women (10).
Figure 2 presents the weighted mean Framingham
CHDRI scores across the BMI-specific waist circumference
categories in the NHANES III sample. As expected, the
CHDRI was lowest in the normal weight/low WC groups
and increased with the level of obesity. Furthermore, those
with a high WC had higher scores than those with a low WC
within each BMI category. The patterns were similar in men
and women and show that the proposed WC thresholds
provide further discrimination of health risk beyond that of
the BMI categories alone, particularly in normal weight and
overweight individuals.
There are several strengths and limitations to this study.
A major strength is the use of large representative popula-
tion samples from Canada and the United States, which
ensures that the results can be generalized. The analyses are
based on cross-sectional data; therefore, cause-and-effect
conclusions cannot be inferred regarding the relation be-
tween WC and health risk. However, the use of the Fra-
mingham risk score for predicting 10-year risk of coronary
events is a clinical tool that is strongly associated with the
risk of future coronary events (25). Because the Framing-
ham algorithm was derived using a predominately white
sample, the CHDRI may not be entirely appropriate to
predict 10-year risk in other ethnic groups (26,27).
At this time, comparisons among studies and temporal
analyses of changes in WC are hampered by methodological
Figure 1: Prevalence of high WC within BMI categories. Data are from NHANES III for (A) men and (B) women and the CHHS for (C)
men and (D) women. The NIH and Health Canada WC thresholds (men: 102 cm; women: 88 cm) and BMI-specific WC thresholds (men:
87, 98, 109, and 124 cm; women: 79, 92, 103, and 115 cm) were compared across BMI categories [normal weight (18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2),
overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2), obese I (30 to 34.9 kg/m2), and obese II (35 kg/m2), respectively].

concerns, including the training of technicians, the use of
different equipment, and the site of WC measurement. The
adjustment of WC thresholds according to the site of mea-
surement in our cross-validation study was based on the
results of Wang et al. (17), who conducted three same-day
measurements at four common WC sites in a sample of 93
individuals (intraclass correlation  0.99). The magnitude
of the differences across sites highlights the need for stan-
dardized guidelines for WC measurement.
In summary, our findings provide strong support for the
use of specific WC thresholds within different BMI catego-
ries for identifying increased health risk. In comparison, the
currently recommended NIH and Health Canada WC
thresholds are inadequate to discriminate health risk within
all BMI categories.
