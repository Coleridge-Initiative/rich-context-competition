Abstract:
Recent empirical studies criticize the sluggish financial integration in the euro area and
find that only interbank money markets are fully integrated so far. This paper studies the
optimal regional and/or sectoral integration of financial systems given that integration is
restricted to the interbank market.
Based on Allen and Gale (2000)'s seminal analysis of financial contagion we derive the
interbank market structure that maximizes consumers' ex-ante expected utility, i.e. that
optimizes the trade-off between the contagion and the diversification effect. We analyze
the impact of various structural parameters including the underlying stochastic structure
on this trade-off. In addition we derive the efficient design of the interbank market that
allows for a cross-regional risk sharing between banks. We also provide a measure for
the efficiency losses that result if financial integration is limited to an integration of the
interbank market.

Non technical summary
Several recent empirical studies argue that the most integrated financial market in the
Euro area is the unsecured money market. Due to legal, regulatory and institutional
obstacles the integration of most other financial markets (except for the market for gov-
ernments bonds) lags far behind the integration of the interbank market.
This paper studies in a first step, in which cases a financial integration that is lim-
ited to an integration of the interbank markets, can nevertheless be welfare improving.
In doing so this first part assumes that the institutional arrangement in the interbank
market allows for a constraint efficient risk sharing. Our study shows that an interna-
tional integration through the interbank market is preferable, if the expected benefits
from the international diversification overcompensate the expected costs from contagion.
Thus while an integration of banks from economies with countervailing business cycles is
beneficial, the interlinkage of banks that face rather similar risks is welfare reducing. In
addition, the benefits of an international integration of the banking sector increases as the
return on long-term investments declines. Thus our analysis suggests that an integration
through the interbank markets is the more preferable the more mature the economies
under considerations are and the lower their marginal product of capital therefore is.
In the second step the paper turns to the institutional arrangement in the interbank
market and derives the arrangement required to implement a constraint efficient cross-
country risk sharing through the interbank market. Interestingly, the study shows that
in order to allow for the most efficient risk sharing interbank deposits must be junior to
other liabilities of banks and interbank debt must not be netted at any time. Thus the
interbank market can only provide an efficient risk sharing if it also allows for financial
contagion between banks through interbank deposits. The risk of financial contagion
is a necessary condition to ensure that contributing to the liquidity insurance between
banks is ex-post incentive compatible. This institutional arrangement that we prove to
be constraint efficient is precisely the arrangement assumed in the first part of the study.
Finally, our paper also shows under which conditions constraint efficient interbank
deposits ­ in contrast to more complex arrangements, i.e. cross-country bank mergers ­
do not allow to capture all benefits from an international risk sharing.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Wie zahlreiche empirische Studien zeigen, ist der am stärksten integrierte Finanzmarkt
im Euroraum der unbesicherte Geldmarkt. Aufgrund von rechtlichen, regulatorischen
aber auch institutionellen Unterschieden bleibt der Integrationsgrad der meisten anderen
Finanzmärkte (mit Ausnahme des Marktes für Staatsanleihen) weit hinter dem des Geld-
marktes zurück.
Das vorliegende Papier untersucht in einem ersten Schritt, unter welchen Umständen
eine Finanzintegration, die auf den Interbankenmarkt beschränkt ist, dennoch von Vorteil
sein kann. Dabei wird eine bestimmte institutionelle Ausgestaltung des Interbankenmar-
kets unterstellt, die eine beschränkt effiziente Risikoteilung zuläßt. Es zeigt sich, dass eine
grenzüberschreitende Risikoteilung über den Interbankenmarkt unter diesen Umständen
dann wünschenswert ist, wenn der erwartete Nutzen der internationalen Diversifikation die
erwarteten Kosten einer möglichen Ansteckung zwischen den Kreditinstituten überkom-
pensiert. Eine Integration von Banken, die von gegenläufigen Konjunkturzyklen betroffen
sind, ist mithin vorteilhaft. Eine Verflechtung von solchen Geldinstituten, die relativ
ähnlichen makroökonomischen Risiken ausgesetzt sind, wirkt dagegen eher wohlfahrts-
mindernd. Darüber hinaus zeigt die Studie aber auch, dass mit abnehmendem Ertrag
langfristiger Investitionen der Vorteil einer Integration steigt. Eine grenzüberschreitende
Verflechtung über den Interbankenmarkt erscheint somit insbesondere für entwickelte
Volkswirtschaften mit vergleichsweise geringem Grenzprodukt des Kapitals vorteilhaft.
Im zweiten Schritt untersucht das vorliegende Papier, welche institutionellen Arrange-
ments am Geldmarkt notwendig sind, um eine möglichst effiziente Risikoteilung über
diesen Markt implementieren zu können. Interessanterweise zeigt sich hierbei, dass eine
effiziente Risikoteilung nur dann erreicht werden kann, wenn Interbankeinlagen gegenüber
anderen Verbindlichkeiten der Banken nachrangig sind und Interbankenverbindlichkeiten
nicht miteinander verrechnet werden können. Der Interbankenmarkt erlaubt somit nur
dann eine effiziente grenzüberschreitende Liquiditätsversicherung zwischen den Kreditin-
stituten, wenn er gleichzeitig die Möglichkeit von Ansteckungen zwischen den Banken
nicht ausschließt. Das Risiko einer Ansteckung ist eine notwendige Bedingung um sicher-
zustellen, dass ex-post eine Liquiditätsversicherung zwischen den Banken anreizverträglich
ist. Diese somit als beschränkt effizient abgeleitete Ausgestaltung des Interbankenmarkets
ist exakt diejenige, die im ersten Abschnitt dieser Studie unterstellt wird.
Letztlich zeigt das Papier auch unter welchen Umständen die Wohlfahrtsgewinne einer
Integration über einen beschränkt effizienten Interbankenmarkt hinter denen einer brei-
teren Integration, wie sie beispielsweise grenzüberschreitende Bankenzusammenschlüsse
darstellen, zurückbleiben.

Financial Integration and Systemic Risk
1 Introduction
The most integrated financial market in the Euro area is the interbank or money market
and within the money market the most integrated segment is the unsecured interbank
market.1 Besides its importance for a smooth monetary policy transmission across the
member states a high degree of integration of this market is also beneficial under risk
sharing considerations. An interlinked banking system within the Euro area provides an
insurance mechanism against regional liquidity shocks. However, the flip side of the coin is
that interbank claims bring about a risk of financial contagion, i.e. increase the systemic
risk. The liquidity crisis of a single institute can easily spill-over to other banks if those
financial intermediaries hold interbank deposits with the troubled bank.
In the present paper we try to evaluate the obvious trade-off that these two effects bring
about and analyze under which conditions the benefits of a cross-regional risk sharing
dominate the expected costs of financial contagion. Doing so we also take into account the
optimal institutional arrangement of the interbank market. Particularly, we show how the
interbank market has to be designed in order to provide a means for a constraint efficient
financial integration given the cross-regional distribution of liquidity shocks. Interestingly,
for reasonable parameter settings we find an efficient arrangement has to allow for the
possibility of interbank bank runs. However, we also show that using simple interbank
arrangements does not allow to capture all benefits from a cross regional risk sharing. More
complex arrangements, i.e. cross-country mergers, of financial institutions can improve
the cross-country insurance against regional liquidity shocks.
Our paper is closely related to Allen and Gale (2000) and Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet
(2000). Like our paper both show that regional-specific liquidity shocks provide a ratio-
nale for interlinking regionally restricted banks of a Diamond and Dybvig (1983)-type.
Interbank deposits in the case of Allen and Gale (2000) and interbank lines of credit in
the case of Freixas, Parigi, and Rochet (2000) enable banks to mutually insure against

1This results is reported in several studies. It is probably most prominently emphasized in Baelen,
Ferrando, Hördahl, Krylova, and Monnet (2004). For a comprehensive institutional analysis of the
various segments of the Euro money market see also Hartmann, Manna, and Manzanares (2001) and for
a description of the most recent developments in that market see European Central Bank (2005). Barros,
Berglöf, Fulghieri, Gual, Mayer, and Vives (2005) also emphasize the disappointing degree of financial
integration in most other financial markets in the Euro area particularly the retail financial markets.

negatively correlated regional liquidity shocks.2 However, when analyzing the structure of
the interbank network both do not take the possibility of aggregate liquidity shocks into
account. Thus any network that connects directly or indirectly all entities of the financial
system provides an efficient mechanism to share the risk of liquidity shocks. In a second
step they introduce an aggregate liquidity shock that occurs with probability zero and
study its impact on arbitrary interbank networks. In contrast, we analyze the decision of
banks to provide each other with interbank deposits in order to share liquidity risk taking
the possibility of aggregate liquidity shocks and financial contagion into account. This
permits us to derive the optimal integration decision dependent upon (i) the underlying
stochastic structure of liquidity needs (ii) individual's risk preferences and (iii) the state
of the technology.
Focusing on a two-regional case we also discuss the efficiency of different interbank
arrangement in dealing with contagion and in implementing an efficient risk sharing.
We show that the rules concerning the seniority of household vs. interbank debt when
liquidating a bank are crucial for the performance of the interbank market system. For a
wide range of parameter settings the interbank market can only implement a constraint
efficient risk sharing if interbank deposits are junior to households claims and interbank
debt cannot be netted. But precisely these arrangements bring about the risk of contagion
between banks. Thus implementing a constraint efficient risk through an interbank market
is necessarily associated with the risk of financial contagion. To that extent our paper is
also related to Leitner (2005) who argues that banks put themselves at risk of contagion
in order to credibly commit to bail each other out.
Moreover, using a mechanism design approach, we are able to identify further institu-
tional improvements that are not available in a simple interbank market setup where the
only decision a bank can make is whether to liquidate its assets with another bank or not.
However, we will argue that these more complex mechanisms that use a larger strategy
space essentially reflect a merged bank and not what is usually labelled an interbank
market.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After specifying the assumptions
section 3 derives the utility that separate banks provide depositors. In section 4 we derive
the optimal deposit contract and the utility that an integrated financial system generates
under the assumption that in order to share regional liquidity risks banks have to use
2In Allen and Gale (2000) there exist four regions two of which experience a positive and two of
which a negative liquidity shock. Aggregate liquidity demand is constant with probability one. This
specification guarantees that there is a need for cross regional liquidity sharing and it permits to study
financial contagion which is the main focus of their paper.

interbank deposits that are junior to households deposits. Section 5 analyzes the trade-
off between having either a partitioned or an integrated financial systems. In section 2.3
we show under which conditions the optimal interbank deposit contract is indeed junior to
households' claims given the optimal deposit contract with households derived in section
4. Finally, we derive in section 7 the optimal mechanism for risk sharing between banks.
In section 8 we argue that this mechanism mainly reflects cross-country mergers and show
to what extent this mechanism leads to a preferable allocation as compared to the one
provided by junior interbank deposits. Section 9 concludes and points out some issues for
further research.
2 The model
2.1 Depositors
Consider an economy with three dates (t = 0, 1, 2) and two symmetrical regions A and
B. Both regions contain a bank and a continuum of mass 1 of households each endowed
with 1 unit of the single consumption good. Households are subject to a preference shock
that realizes in t = 1 and that is not publicly observable. Ex-ante (in t = 0) households
only know that they will be impatient (i
= 1) with probability q. In that case they can
only derive utility from consumption in t = 1. With probability (1 - q) they know that
they will turn out to be patient and only want to consume in t = 2. Thus households'
ex-ante expected utility is given by the following function
E [U (c1
; c2
)] = E [i
u (c1
) + (1 - i
) u (c2
)]
with
u (ct
) =
1
1 - 
c1-
t
and  > 1.
Given the law of large numbers the regional fraction of impatient households is
i
di = q.
However, this fraction of patient consumers (i.e. the probability that a given household
turns out to be impatient) in each region is itself subject to shocks. It can either turn
out to be 0, 1
2
or 1. The probability distribution of the liquidity shocks in the two regions
is given by the following table. Thus the probability that all households in both regions
turn out to be patient, for instance, is given by b.

2.2 Investment technology
There is only one direct investment technology available in the economy. This technology
can be liquidated in t = 1 at no costs.3 However, it only pays a positive interest in t = 2:
t = 0 t = 1 t = 2
finished -1 0 R > 1
liquidated -1 +1 0
In t = 0 households can invest in the technology. Because it is not observable whether
a particular household is patient or impatient, there is no direct insurance mechanism
against liquidity risks available.
Besides direct investment households can deposit their endowment at a bank. Banks
offer deposit contracts, that specifies the promised repayment d1
if deposits are withdrawn
in t = 1. The residual of banks' assets in t = 2 will be repaid to households that keep
their deposits until t = 2. There is one bank in each region. However, banking markets
are contestable. Therefore banks are forced to offer the deposit contract that maximizes
the expected utility of depositors.
If a bank cannot serve all withdrawals in t = 1 all depositors (patient and impatient)
receive the same pro-rata repayment. Thus we do not consider any kind of sequential
service constraint. Hence we exclude expectation driven bank runs of depositors.
2.3 The interbank market
We analyze under which condition it is reasonable for banks in different regions to provide
each other with interbank deposits. Interbank deposit contracts specify a repayment
dB
1
; dB
2
contingent whether the deposits are withdrawn in t = 1 or held until t = 2.
Interbank deposits are assumed to be subordinated to households' repayments in t =
3Note that this simplifying assumption compared to the standard Diamond and Dybvig (1983)-model
can be seen as a short-cut for the existence of a liquid financial market in t = 1 at which agents from other
than the considered regions and banks from the region A and B trade liquidity against financial claims
promising a t = 2-return R at the arbitrage free price p = 1 (see Fecht (2004) for a detailed description).

1.4 However, interbank debt is senior to households' t = 2-repayment.5 The regional
liquidity shock is private information to the banks in the respective region. Banks cannot
observe the liquidity shock in other regions. Thus interbank deposit contracts cannot be
contingent on regional liquidity shocks. In order to provide a means of cross-regional risk
sharing interbank deposit contracts have to be incentive compatible.
Note that within each region we assume Bertrand competition among banks. This
ensures that banks will offer contracts to depositors and choose interbank market arrange-
ments that maximize depositors' utility.
We make the following general assumptions about the institutional setup of this mar-
ket:
1. First, we assume that interbank debt is junior to households' deposits. This means
that if a bank fails then all households' deposits (those households that wanted to
withdraw and those that initially wanted to keep their deposits) are served first
before any repayment is made on interbank debt. Note that this requires a gross-
settlement of interbank debt­i.e. interbank positions cannot be netted.
2. Next, we assume that if a bank is illiquid then depositors force the bank management
to immediately (still within t = 1) withdraw deposits from other banks. Thus in
case of illiquidity of one bank interbank deposits are withdrawn irrespective of the
original decision of the bank management.
3. Finally, we assume that depositors cannot observe whether a bank withdraws inter-
bank deposits or not. Thus the decision of patient depositors in one region cannot
depend on the withdrawal decision of banks analyzed here. However, it is impor-
tant to show that in equilibrium it is preferable for patient depositors to keep their
deposits until t = 2. This is always true for sufficiently high a.
2.4 Preferences of bank managers
We make the following behavioral assumption about bank managers. Given a consumer
deposit contract D and given an interbank market contract DB bank managers choose a
4Note that this is an optimal arrangement, because this gives banks the strongest incentive in this
set-up to provide the other bank with liquidity. If interbank deposits were senior to households' deposits
then banks would always draw on their interbank deposits first to provide liquidity to other banks or
households irrespective of their liquidity shock. See section 6 for a proof of this argument.
5Since we assume below that regional shocks are non-verifiable to non-regional banks, this is also an
efficient arrangement.
5
state contingent plan for their behavior on the interbank market that maximizes expected
utility of their non-bank customers.
This assumption needs some further justification because, at the stage where bank
managers observe their respective liquidity shock, they cannot contractually be forced
to act in a certain state dependent way (i.e. withdraw deposits only in certain states).
Contractual arrangements that align bankers' and depositors' interests do however exist.
Consider e.g. a contract that guarantees the manager a transfer which is an increasing
function f(·) of the sum actually paid out to an individual depositor in t = 1. In particular
let
f(·) =  ·
1
1 - 
d1-,
where d denote the sum paid out and  is arbitrarily small. This contract obviously aligns
the interests of the banker and those of the depositors from the ex-ante point of view.
2.5 Equilibrium concept
An interbank market with a given contract DB induces a Bayesian game among bank
managers. In this game a strategy is a state contingent plan for withdrawal decisions
w(q) : {0, 1/2, 1}  {0, 1} .
An equilibrium is a combination of deposit contracts and bank strategies that are
mutually consistent and compatible with competitive banking bahavior.
Definition 1 An equilibrium consists of
(i) A deposit contract D = (d1
, d2
),
(ii) An interbank deposit contract DB = dB
1
, dB
2
and
(iii) bank strategies w(q) : {0, 1/2, 1}  {0, 1},
such that
(i) Bank strategies are a Bayesian equilibrium of the interbank market game given the
interbank contract DB.
(ii) The deposit contract D maximizes consumer utility given DB and the withdrawal
behavior of all banks.
6
2.6 Institutional choice
Whether or not financial institutions engage on the interbank market will depend on
whether the equilibrium outcome yields higher utility to consumers than under financial
separation.
3 Welfare implications of separated banks
Because of the contestability of the banking market a separated bank will offer the de-
posit contract dS
1
that maximizes the expected utility subject to the per capita budget
constraint. Given dS
1
> 1 the bank is always illiquid if q = 1. In that case the bank can
only repay 1 to each depositor. If q = 0 the bank can finish all its projects and pay R in
t = 2 to all depositors. Thus the contractual repayment is only important if some house-
holds want to withdraw while others want to keep their deposits until t = 2. Only for
q = 1
2
the bank actually has to pay the contracted amount d1
to its impatient depositors.
It immediately follows from the per capita budget constraint that the patient depositors
receive a repayment 2R - Rd1
in t = 2. Thus the optimal deposit contract that the bank
can offer maximizes the expected utility function

4 Welfare implications of an integrated financial sys-
tem
As already emphasized in the introduction we focus on cross-regional risk-sharing over the
interbank market in this paper, because this seems to be particularly within the Euro area
the most integrated part of the financial systems. The interbank market allows banks to
provide each other with interbank deposits that specify the provision of liquidity at date
1.
In this section we consider a potential equilibrium where (i) deposit contracts are given
by D = (d1
,d2
) and (ii) interbank contracts specify that each bank has the right to either
7
withdraw d1
/2 at date 1 or d2
/2 at date 2 from the other bank.6 Since banks' liquidity
needs are not observable for other players, the contract leads to a Bayesian game among
banks. In what follows we will consider the strategy profile where each bank withdraws
its deposits at date 1 if and only if the early liquidity shock has realized. In section 6 we
will then show that this is indeed a Bayesian Nash equilibrium of the interbank market
game.
Depositors' equilibrium payoffs can be characterized as follows: When both regions
are not hit by any shock, depositors realize their desired consumption levels d
1
at date
1 or d
2
. When both regions experience a late shock, consumers get R at date 2. When
shocks in different directions occur the levels d
1
or d
2
are realized. A liquidity crises
occurs in case of a liquidity shortage in both regions. Moreover, if in addition d  4/3
both banks end up being illiquid in those cases where only one region is hit by a negative
liquidity. Finally, no cross-regional risk-sharing is possible in cases in which one region
has no impatient depositors while a fraction of 1/2 is impatient in the other region.
Thus, households' expected utility in an integrated financial systems is given by

1
2
u dM
1
+
1
2
u 2R - RdM
1
+ (b + d) u (R) + (c + 2f) u (1) .
It is easy to see that the deposit contract that maximizes households' expected utility
in a financial system that only implements cross-regional risk sharing over the interbank
market is the same as in a financial system with separated banks
dM
1
=
2
R(1-)/ + 1
.
Note, however, that this is only the optimal deposit contract if dM
1
> 4
3
or put differently
if
R > 2 
-1 (3)
Only for these parameter settings contagion will occur in the integrated financial system.
If (3) does not hold then an optimally integrated financial system also provides a means
for risk-sharing for those cases in which one region is hit by a negative liquidity shock
while in the other region half of the households turn out to be patient. Consequently,
6Other potential equilibria (with different levels of interbank deposits) can be ruled out since they
would imply that withdrawals on the interbank market are either (i) not sufficient to finance additional
liquidity needs or (ii) too large so that a withdrawal even leads to the liquidation of a bank with excess
liquidity.
8
under these conditions linking the two regions does not bring about any costs. However,
if (3) holds then the decision to integrate the two regional financial systems is non-trivial
and is discussed in the following section.
5 Optimal financial integration
Obviously, it is efficient to integrate the two regions in one financial systems if for the
optimal deposit contract d
1
given by (2)
E UM (d
1
) > E US (d
1
) . (4)
Defining
E UG (d

) =

2 (1 - )
2
R(1-)/ + 1

+
2R1/
R(1-)/ + 1
1-
, (5)
it is easy to see that (4) requires that
e 2E UG (d
1
) - u (R) - u (1) > f E UG (d
1
) - u (1) . (6)
The LHS of (6) are the benefits from diversification and the RHS are the costs from
contagion. Thus if the benefits overcompensate the costs an integration of the two regions
in one financial system is preferable.
Obviously, (6) can be transformed in
e u (R) - E UG (d
1
) < (e - f) E UG (d
1
) - u (1) .
We have:
Proposition 2 A separated financial system is always preferable if e  f. For e > f an
integrated financial system for the two regions is preferable if
(2e - f)
R(1-)/ + 1
2

> (e - f) + eR1-. (7)
Proof. Reinserting (5) in (6) and rearranging yields (7).
More details about the optimality of different arrangements can be derived from the
following example.
Example 3 For  = 2 (7) can be reduced to
(4e - 2f) R-1/2 > (2e - 3f) + (2e + f) R-1.
9
This holds for all
R  1,
(2e + f)2
(2e - 3f)2
.
Thus taking (3) into account an integrated financial system ­ even though it brings about
a risk of financial contagion ­ is preferable, if
R  4,
(2e + f)2
(2e - 3f)2
,
and this is a non-empty set. In contrast, for
R >
(2e + f)2
(2e - 3f)2
separation is preferable if e > f.
Accordingly an increase in the long run rate of return R makes financial separation
more desirable. A higher rate of return R raises the cost of financial contagion because
contagion always reduced payoffs in the regions concerned to 1.
6 Interbank market and the implementation of the con-
straint efficient risk-sharing
6.1 Payoffs of the interbank market game
In this section we analyze in detail the equilibrium behavior of banks on the interbank
market. Given the institutional arrangement of the interbank market the state contingent
pay-offs of both banks given their decisions to either withdraw or keep their deposits with
the other bank are summarized in table 1 and 2.
Because of the assumed gross settlement of interbank liabilities, both banks have
to liquidate some of their assets in order to repay their interbank deposits even if they
withdraw their deposits in the same period. Assume that both banks promise a repayment
{dIB
1
; dIB
2
} = {1
2
d1
; 1
2
d2
} on interbank deposits. Thus in order to repay the deposits of
bank B if bank B withdraws in t = 1 bank A has to liquidate 1
2
d1
of its assets. At
the same time bank B has to liquidate 1
2
d1
of its deposits if bank A also withdraws in
t = 1. If both banks are hit by a positive liquidity shock ({qA
; qB
} = {0; 0}) they are
both able liquidate this amount without collapsing. Thus given that both banks withdraw

; d2
} to depositors of bank A and bank
B, respectively, is given by {0; 1
2
(d1
+ d2
)}.7
In contrast, in those states where {qA
; qB
} = {0; 1
2
} only bank A can fulfill its payment
obligation if bank B withdraws. Because d1
> 1 bank B is illiquid and has to serve
households deposits first. After receiving the payment from bank A the overall liquidity
available to bank B is given by: 1 + 1
2
d1
. Thus the fractional repayment that bank A
will receive from bank B follows from d1
+ = 1 + 1
2
d1
and is (for the optimal deposit
contract with d1
= 2R
R+R1/
) given by = R1/
R+R1/
< 1
2
d1.
Thus bank A can only repay
R(1 - 1
2
d1
) + = 1
2
d2
+ to its depositors.8
Similarly, if both banks withdraw in those states with {qA
; qB
} = {0; 1} bank A has
to liquidate 1
2
d1
in order to fulfill its payment obligation. Bank B is illiquid has to serve
households deposits first. Just like in the above described case only the remaining liquidity
can be paid to bank A.
If neither bank has a liquidity shock ({qA
; qB
} = {1
2
; 1
2
}) and both banks withdraw
their interbank deposits then both banks fail. They cannot raise sufficient funds in t = 1
by liquidating their projects to repay the impatient depositors and honor the interbank
deposits. In that case all projects are liquidated and households deposits are served
7Note that this follows from the fact that both banks can only store the repayment on interbank
deposits until t = 2 when the funds are needed to repay the depositors and therefore R(1 - 1
2
d1
) + 1
2
d1
=
1
2
(d1
+ d2
)
8Note that if households could observe the interbank payments and the regional liquidity shock de-
positors in region A would run if d1
> 1

d2
+ . Thus depositors in region A would end up with {1; 1}
just like depositors in region B in that case.
11
pro-rata­i.e. each depositor receives a repayment of 1.
The same happens if both banks withdraw their interbank deposits in all those states in
which at least one bank has a negative liquidity shock. Both banks turn out to be illiquid
and can only repay a pro-rata repayment of 1 to households. However, in those cases both
banks will always fail irrespective of their decision to withdraw interbank deposits or not.
For instance, even if in the state {qA
; qB
} = {1; 1
2
} bank A would not decide to withdraw
it would turn out to be illiquid because of the withdrawals of households. Depositors will
therefore still within t = 1 force bank A to withdraw its interbank deposits from bank B
in order to raise some additional liquidity. As soon as bank A withdraws its interbank
deposits bank B will also turn out to be illiquid. Thus in those states both banks will
be forced to withdraw irrespective of their initial decision. Consequently, both banks will
finally fail and repay only the pro-rata repayment 1 to each depositor.
It is easy to see that in all those states with qA
= 1
2
and qA
= 1 bank A will always
be illiquid if bank B withdraws. Therefore, its own decision to withdraw or not does not
matter for the repayment to its depositors.
In contrast, if both banks are hit by a positive liquidity shock and bank B withdraws
while bank A keeps its interbank deposits bank A has to liquidate 1
2
d1
of its investment
to repay bank B. But because bank B is solvent bank A receives 1
2
d2
in t = 2 from bank
B. Thus bank A can repay R(1 - 1
2
d1
) + 1
2
d2
= d2
. In contrast, bank B receives 1
2
d1
and
can only store this liquidity. It does not have to liquidate any investments but has to pay
1
2
d2
to bank A in t = 2. Thus bank B can repay R - 1
2
d2
+ 1
2
d1
. In general, it is easy to
see that if bank A has a liquidity surplus and does not withdraw its interbank deposits
while bank B withdraws bank B will always be liquid and able to repay 1
2
d2
in t = 2 to
bank A.
If both banks do not withdraw their interbank deposits in t = 1 ({sA
; sB
} = {0; 0})
then no funds are transferred between the two banks if both stay liquid. If either bank
fails to repay its depositors then depositors can force the bank to collect its interbank
deposits. This happens, for instance, if {qA
; qB
} = {0; 1}. Because bank B is illiquid it
will be forced to withdraw its interbank deposits. In the liquidation of bank B bank A
can only recoup a repayment of on its interbank deposits.
Finally, it is important to note that bank A can only survive {qA
; qB
} = {1
2
; 1
2
} if
neither bank A nor bank B withdraws.
6.2 Equilibrium
Due to the fact that liquidity needs are not observable among banks, the interbank market
induces a Bayesian game among banks at t = 1. A bank's strategy maps the realized

liquidity demand (the fraction of early withdrawing depositors) at t = 1 into a decision
to withdraw or to keep the interbank deposit.
Our first main result is that indeed an interbank market with the above institutional
features may allow for a limited extend of risk sharing. This means that negative liquidity
shocks can be compensated by positive shocks, however, excess liquidity is not equally
distributed among regions.
Proposition 4 The interbank market game has a Bayesian Nash equilibrium where both
banks withdraw at t=1 if and only if they experience an early liquidity shock. In this
equilibrium the interbank market (i) provides an optimal risk sharing for states with op-
posed regional liquidity shocks (ii) does not implement a cross regional risk sharing for
states with excess aggregate liquidity (iii) causes contagion in states with aggregate liquidity
shortages.
Proof. Given that bank B only withdraws its interbank deposits if it is hit by a
negative liquidity shock (qB
= 1) we have to show that it is optimal for bank A to
withdraw its interbank deposits in t = 1 if and only if the bank is hit by a negative
liquidity shock (qA
= 1). From table 1 and 2 it is easy to derive the following incentive
compatibility constraints and verify under which conditions they hold:
First consider qA
= 0. Expecting that bank B only withdraws its interbank deposits
13
if qB
= 0 bank A keeps its interbank deposits until t = 2 iff
(b + d) U (0; R) + eU (0; d2
)  (IC1)
bU 0; R -
1
2
(d2
- d1
) + (d + e) U 0;
1
2
d2
+ .
(IC1) always hold because R > R - 1
2
(d2
- d1
) and R > d2
> 1
2
d2
+ .
For qA
= 1
2
bank A will not withdraw its interbank deposits in t = 1 iff
(d + a) U (d1
; d2
) + fU (1; 1)  (IC2)
dU d1
; R -
1
2
d2
+ (a + f) U (1; 1) .
Since d2
> d1
> 1 (IC2) always holds for the optimal deposit contract that banks offer
to households9 if R < 2/(-1). Even if R > 2/(-1) and therefore U d1
; R - 1
2
d2
>
U (d1
; d2
) (IC2) always holds if a is relative to d sufficiently large that
a [U (d1
; d2
) - U (1; 1)]  d U d1
; R -
1
2
d2
- U (d1
; d2
))
Finally consider qA
= 1. Given that bank B only withdraws if qB
= 1 the repayment
bank A's depositors receive is independent of the decision of bank A to withdraw its
interbank deposits or not because if the bank does not withdraw its interbank deposits
the bank fails and will be forced by the depositors to withdraw. Thus the incentive
compatibility constraint is given by
eU (d1
; 0) + (f + c) U (1; 0)  eU (d1
; 0) + (f + c) U (1; 0) ,
and holds with an equality.
It is important to note that for reasonable parameter settings banks would not be able
to implement any cross regional risk sharing using interbank deposits if those deposits
were senior to households claims.
If interbank deposits were senior both banks would have an incentive to withdraw their
deposits irrespective whether or not they are actually in need for liquidity­i.e. independent
of their respective qi
.
To see this note that if interbank deposits were senior bank A's incentive compatibility
constraint to keep deposits until t = 2 if qA
= 1
2
would change from (IC2) to (IC2')
(d + a) U (d1
; d2
) + fU (1; 1)  dU d1
; R -
1
2
d2
+ (a + f) U (d1
; d2
) (IC2')
9Remember that the optimal deposit contract that banks offer to households always implies a risk
sharing d2
d1
= R1/ for integrated as well as separated financial systems given that banks cannot implement
a cross regional risk sharing in cases of positive aggregate liquidity shocks.
14
which obviously does not hold for very large a and not even for R > 2/(-1) iff
d U d1
; R -
1
2
d2
- U (d1
; d2
) < f [U (d1
; d2
) - U (1; 1)]
However, taking into account that it is preferable for both banks to withdraw their
interbank deposits for qi
= 1
2
the incentive compatibility constraint of bank A to keep
their interbank deposits until t = 2 if qA
= 0 changes to (IC1')
bU (0; R) + (d + e) U (0; d2
)  bU 0; R -
1
2
(d2
- d1
) + (d + e) U (0; R) (IC1')
Obviously, for (d + e) being sufficiently high relative to b it is also for banks that are hit
by a positive liquidity shock preferable to withdraw their interbank deposits in t = 1.
In contrast, if (IC2') does not hold but (IC1') then an interbank market with senior
interbank deposits can implement some cross regional risk sharing. In that case the
interbank market would allow for the cross regional risk sharing without bringing about
the risk of contagion. Because if interbank deposits are senior and banks only keep their
deposits until t = 2 if they are hit by a positive liquidity shock then there are no spill-over
of the illiquidity of one bank to the other in those cases with {qA
; qB
} = 1
2
; 1 and 1; 1
2
.
But if banks always withdraw their interbank deposits in t = 1 irrespective of their
particular liquidity shock­because (IC2') and (IC1') do both not hold­then the interbank
market with senior interbank debt cannot provide any cross regional risk sharing.
7 Alternative Market Mechanisms
So far, we took the organization of the interbank market as exogenously given. In this
section we study whether there is an alternative interbank market mechanism that yields
a superior outcome. We start out by assuming that consumer deposit contracts of the
sort derived in section 4 already exist. In our setup the revelation principle holds. Hence,
we may restrict our analysis to direct revelation mechanisms. A direct interbank market
mechanism asks both banks for a report on their realized liquidity parameter and maps
the tuple of reports (^
qA
, ^
qB
) into a decision x, i.e.
x = f (^
qA
, ^
qB
) .
The decision consists of four elements:
· A transfer t1
from bank 1 to bank 2 in period 1.
· A transfer t2
from bank 1 to bank 2 in period 2.
15
· A decision on the closure of each bank in period 1.
Is is possible to improve the efficiency of the risk sharing implemented by the interbank
market mechanism? The interbank market studied so far does not provide an efficient
risk sharing in case of a positive liquidity shock in one region and no liquidity shock
(qi
= 1
2
) in the other region. Is it possible to improve upon that outcome? Consider
some alternative mechanism that has the feature that (i) no bank closes when announced
aggregate liquidity would be sufficient to honor the withdrawals in period 1 (ii) with
opposing liquidity needs there is a sufficient transfer to the bank with high liquidity needs
in period 1 (iii) provides efficient risk sharing in cases of a positive liquidity shock in one
region and no liquidity shock in the other. Such a mechanism would have to fix contingent
transfers as described in table 3.
It is useful to highlight the fundamental role of bankruptcy in providing incentives to
managers.
Lemma 5 Suppose that a bank's date 2 value is constant. In order to ensure that self-
revelation is incentive compatibility the probability of a bank closure has to increase weakly
in the announced liquidity need for period 1.
Proof. This follows immediately from the specification of the bank manager's prefer-
ences.

The following proposition derives the necessary properties of bankruptcy in a social
choice function f (·) that guarantees an efficient risk sharing in case of a positive liquidity
shock in one region and no shock in the other. It shows that the social choice function
has to implement a closure of all banks in those cases where the reported liquidity needs
of both banks indicate an aggregate negative liquidity shock in period 1: ^

16
Proposition 6 There is no mechanism that simultaneously satisfies the following condi-
tions: (i) Bayesian incentive compatibility, (ii) efficient risk sharing in case of a positive
liquidity shock in one region and no shock in the other (iii) the survival of one bank in
case of a negative liquidity shock in one region and no shock in the other region.
Proof. Consider without loss of generality bank A. In order to implement the efficient
risk sharing bank A would have to pay a transfer 1
2
d
1
in states with (^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (0, 1).
However, to make self-revelation incentive compatible for a bank with zero liquidity needs
(qA
= 0) one has to implement a transfer larger than 1
2
d
1
in case that announcements are
(^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (1
2
, 1). This implies the closure of a bank with qA
= 1
2
for (^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (1
2
, 1).
On the other hand, to avoid that bank A reports a high liquidity need ( ^
qA
= 1) but
actually has qA
= 1
2
one has to close that bank for announced liquidity needs (^
q1
, ^
q2
) =
(1, 1
2
).10
Moreover, one can show that the above necessary conditions are also sufficient.
Proposition 7 There is a mechanism that simultaneously satisfies Bayesian incentive
compatibility and the efficient risk sharing in case of one positive liquidity shock. Under
this mechanism no bank survives in case of an excessive aggregate liquidity need at date
1.
Proof. It is straightforward to verify that all IC constraints hold.
This shows that the interbank market mechanism from section 6 is not the optimal
mechanism. Risk sharing with an aggregate positive liquidity shock can be improved.
However, the mechanism described in Proposition 7 cannot be implemented by an inter-
bank market in which only contracts can be traded that prespecify a certain payment
dB
1
on the funds withdrawn in t = 1 and dB
2
for those kept until t = 2 with some other
bank. Even if funds can be withdrawn fractionally such a market mechanism can never
implement the optimal mechanism, i.e. it can never implement any risk sharing in cases
of positive liquidity shocks.
A mechanism such as the one described in Proposition 7 would be quite complex in
situations with more than two realizations of liquidity shocks. It would actually require
both banks to choose a signal from a set that is as large as the set of possible realizations
of the shock and map the tuple of announcements into an outcome. Such a mechanism
would establish a tight relationship among two banks that we will call a merger in what
follows.
10Note that one other option would be to make bank A pay in cases of announced liquidity needs
(^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (1, 1
2
) and close it only for announcements (^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (1, 1). However, given the budget
constraint of banks A if it really has qA
= 1 this means to the closure bank A at (^
qA
, ^
qB
) = (1, 1
2
).
17
8 Merger
The maximum degree of risk sharing can be reached by a bank operating in both regions
or by a complex mechanism such as the one described in the previous section. Such
a contract can be viewed as a multi-regional bank that can use its assets to serve the
withdrawal of depositors from both regions. However, given that the deposit contract
promises dM
1
> 1 the bank is illiquid if the fraction of impatient depositors is 1 in both
regions, i.e. if the aggregate fraction of early withdrawals is 1. If in addition dM
1
> 4
3
the
bank is also illiquid in those cases where only one region is hit by a negative liquidity
shock. Thus assuming dM
1
> 4
3
the bank can also only pay 1 to all depositors if the
aggregate fraction of impatient depositors is 4
3
. Therefore, from the perspective of one
region the costs of a multi-regional bank are that with probability f a state occurs in
which the multi-regional bank provides a channel for contagion of a negative liquidity
shock from the other region.
Obviously, similar to banks that use the interbank market described in section 6 a
multi-regional bank is beneficial in those states where the regional liquidity shocks com-
pensate each other. In these cases the bank is not illiquid because it can repay the
promised amount dM
1
to the aggregate fraction of 1
2
of impatient depositors. Therefore,
in those states that occur with probability 2e multi-regional banks provide a way for an
inter-regional risk-sharing.
In addition, a multi-regional bank also provides a means for cross-regional risk-sharing
in those states in which in one region 1
2
of the depositors turn out to be impatient while
in the other region all households want to consume in t = 2. In these states the patient
depositors from the first region benefit at the expense of the patient depositors from the
other region, because the bank can finish more projects and can therefore generate the
higher per capita t = 2-repayment: 4
3
- R

.
In this section we ask whether the possibility of a bank merger changes the main result
from section 5 that financial decentralization may be superior to financial integration. In
general the optimal deposit contract is different under a merger. Given dM

Comparing (8) and (1) it is easy to see that the optimality condition for the deposit
contract offered by a multi-regional bank is identical to the one for the deposit contract
offered by regionally separated banks if d = 0. Consequently, in that case a multi-regional
bank will offer the same deposit contract as regionally separated banks.11 Hence we have
Proposition 8 For d > 0 integration over the interbank market is less efficient than
cross-regional bank mergers. However, there are risk structures (a, b, c, d, e, f) such that a
bank merger delivers lower utility to consumers than a separated financial system.
9 Conclusion
In this paper we have derived the trade-off that emerges between keeping regional banking
systems separated and integrating regional financial systems given that an integration is
only possible using interbank deposits. We found that for most parameter values a cross-
regional risk sharing using interbank deposits cannot be implemented without incurring
the risk of financial contagion. Moreover, our results also show that not all benefits from
financial integration can be realized using only an integrated interbank market. Cross-
country mergers of banks provide a more efficient cross regional risk sharing mechanism.
In analyzing the trade-off we have shown that an integrated financial system is more
preferable the lower the rate of return on long-term investment. Thus our results suggest
that it is particularly more preferable for advanced economies with a lower marginal
productivity of capital to establish a common financial system. However, to analyze this
issue in-depth within a growth model is one important point for further research.
Another issue that we have to leave for further research is to extent the model to
a multi-regional setting and analyze which properties of the cross-regional distribution
of liquidity shocks might lead to an imperfectly integrated financial system and which
implications this has for systemic risk.
11As is shown in the appendix for d > 0 the deposit contract offered by a multi-regional bank will
promise a higher repayment in t = 1. Thus for d > 0 it follows that dM
1
> dS

.
