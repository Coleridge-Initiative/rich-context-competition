Abstract:
This study provides evidence on how German multinational firms have restructured their
service activities around the recent crisis. Making use of new micro-level data on service
imports of German multinationals from 2002-2008, we assess the determinants of service
offshoring along the extensive and intensive margins. In particular, we evaluate how
internal frictions in terms of a sharp drop in the sales level (per employee) and external
frictions in terms of a reduced availability of credit co-determine the likelihood and the
extent of sourcing services from abroad. First, we find that firms are less likely to
start to import services from abroad if they are under cost pressure. By contrast, firms
intensify existing service imports linkages in times of a sales drop. Second, financial
constraints, which played a major role for the goods trade during the crisis, did not have
any significant effect on service imports. These results are in line with the argument that
the generally observed crisis-resilience of service trade stems from increased pressures
to save on variable costs through offshoring and from its lower dependence on external
finance. Furthermore, and in line with our argument, we find that a decline in sales and
labor productivity induces firms to sort into intra-firm rather than arm's-length trading.

Non-technical summary
The financial crisis in the years 2007-2008 and the resulting recession had a strong impact
on international trade in goods. In contrast to the general decrease of cross-border
activities, trade in services proved to be relatively resilient throughout the crisis. In a
recent policy paper, Borchert and Mattoo (2012) give three possible explanations for
the apparent different behavior of trade in services. First, they argue that the demand
for services is less cyclical than the demand for goods. Second, trade in services is
less dependent on external finance and therefore less susceptible to changes in credit
availability. Third, internal cost pressure may have forced firms into the international
outsourcing of services that were formerly conducted in-house. These arguments give
rise to the presumption that the financial and real frictions to which firms are exposed
affect trade in goods and trade in services differently.
This study provides first insights into the factors that determine service imports with
a particular focus on the role of internal cost pressure and external financial constraints.
We use information on cross-border service transactions available in the International
Trade in Services Statistics for Germany and combine it with information on German
multinational firms and information on cross-country and cross-sectoral occupational
wages. We adopt a two-step estimation approach to investigate the adjustments of
German multinationals along the extensive margin (the probability of being a service
importer) and the intensive margin (the level of service imports) of service imports.
Our first-stage results are mostly in line with the vast evidence on trade in goods.
We show that more productive firms are more likely to engage in international trade.
Moreover, these service importing firms source from nearby countries with a high GDP
and low wages in the sector which supplies the respective service. Furthermore, firms
with a foreign ultimate beneficial owner are more likely to import services than firms
with a German ultimate beneficial owner. We introduce changes in sales and sales per
employee (labor productivity) as measures of internal frictions and find a positive impact
on the probability of service offshoring, i.e., the probability of a firm importing services
from abroad decreases if the firm is under cost pressure. Then, we use credit conditions
on the capital market as a measure of external frictions. They have ­ in contrast to trade
in goods ­ no significant impact on service trade.
Our second-stage results differ from the results for trade in goods. We find evidence
that both a decrease in sales and a decrease in labor productivity significantly increase
the level of service imports. Hence, while internal cost pressures do not force firms to start
importing services from abroad, they intensify already existing service import relations.
Credit conditions have no significant effect on the intensity of offshoring.
Additionally, we analyze the factors which influence the channel (intra-firm versus
arm's-length) through which firms decide to import services. Inter alia, we find that a
decline in domestic sales (per employee) causes firms to import services from their foreign
affiliates than from independent suppliers. These results strengthen our hypothesis that
internal cost pressure induces firms to import services from lower-cost foreign countries.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Die Finanzkrise der Jahre 2007-2008 und die daraus resultierende Rezession hatten im-
mense Auswirkungen auf den weltweiten Handel. Im Gegensatz zum generellen Einbruch
des Güterhandels, erwies sich der Handel mit Dienstleistungen während der Krise als rela-
tiv robust. In einem aktuellen Forschungspapier nennen Borchert und Mattoo (2012) drei
mögliche Gründe für die geringe Krisenanfälligkeit des Dienstleistungshandels. Als erstes
Argument führen die Autoren an, dass die Nachfrage nach Dienstleistungen weniger kon-
junkturabhängig als Güternachfrage sei. Zweitens sei der Handel mit Dienstleistungen
weniger abhängig von Fremdkapital und somit auch weniger von Änderungen des Kredit-
angebots betroffen. Drittens bestehe die Möglichkeit, dass Unternehmen in Zeiten von
erhöhtem Kostendruck dazu neigen, Dienstleistungen, die ursprünglich unternehmensin-
tern bereitgestellt wurden, nun ins Ausland zu verlagern. Diese Argumentation führt zu
der Hypothese, dass sowohl finanzielle als auch reale Friktionen, mit denen Unternehmen
konfrontiert sind, unterschiedliche Auswirkungen auf den Handel mit Dienstleistungen
und den Handel mit Gütern haben.
Diese Studie zeigt erstmalig die Determinanten von Dienstleistungsimporten deutscher
multinationaler Firmen auf. Der Schwerpunkt der Untersuchung liegt dabei auf der
Rolle von unternehmensinternem Kostendruck und veränderter Fremdkapitalbedingun-
gen. Wir verwenden Informationen zu grenzüberschreitenden Dienstleistungstransak-
tionen aus der internationalen Dienstleistungsstatistik für Deutschland und verknüpfen
diese mit Informationen über deutsche multinationale Unternehmen und Informationen
zu Lohnkosten in unterschiedlichen Ländern und Sektoren. Mit Hilfe eines zweistu-
fige Schätzverfahrens untersuchen wir die Anpassungen deutscher multinationaler Un-
ternehmen entlang des extensiven Rands (die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass ein Unternehmen
Dienstleistungen importiert) und des intensiven Rands (die Intensität der Dienstleis-
tungsimporte).
Die Ergebnisse der ersten Stufe unserer Schätzung entsprechen denjenigen für den
Güterhandel. Wir zeigen, dass produktivere Unternehmen mit größerer Wahrschein-
lichkeit Dienstleistungen importieren. Darüber hinaus importieren diese Firmen die
Dienstleistungen aus näher liegenden Ländern mit einem hohen BIP und einem gerin-
gen Lohnniveau in dem Wirtschaftsbereich, der die Dienstleistung bereitstellt. Die
Wahrscheinlichkeit für Dienstleistungsimporte ist zudem höher für Unternehmen mit
einem ausländischen Eigentümer als diejenigen mit einem deutschen Eigentümer. Als
Maß für den internen Kostendruck wird die Veränderung des Gesamtumsatzes und des
Umsatzes je Mitarbeiter (Arbeitsproduktivität) verwendet. Wir kommen zum Ergebnis,
dass eine Veränderung des Umsatzes und der Arbeitsproduktivität einen positiven Ein-
fluss auf die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Dienstleistungsimporten ausübt. Ein Unternehmen,
das unter einem zunehmenden Kostendruck steht, importiert also mit geringerer Wahr-
scheinlichkeit Dienstleistungen. Des Weiteren verwenden wir die Angebotsbedingungen
auf dem Kapitalmarkt als Maß für externe Friktionen. Im Gegensatz zum Güterhandel
haben diese keinen signifikanten Einfluss auf den Import von Dienstleistungen.
Die Ergebnisse der zweiten Stufe der Schätzung unterscheiden sich von den Ergeb-
n
nissen für den Güterhandel. Sowohl ein Umsatz- als auch ein Produktivitätsrückgang
erhöhen signifikant die Intensität der Dienstleistungsimporte. Während der interne Kos-
tendruck also nicht dazu führt, dass Unternehmen mit Dienstleistungsimporten beginnen,
steigert er die Intensität der bereits bestehenden Importbeziehungen. Kreditbedingungen
haben keinen signifikanten Einfluss auf die Intensität der Dienstleistungsimporte.
Darüber hinaus untersuchen wir die Faktoren, die die Entscheidung beeinflussen, ob
ein Unternehmen Dienstleistungen von einem ausländischen Tochterunternehmen oder
von einem unabhängigen Anbieter bezieht. Unter anderem zeigt sich dabei, dass bei
einem Umsatzrückgang (je Mitarbeiter) im Inland Unternehmen bevorzugt Dienstleis-
tungen von ihren ausländischen Töchtern (und nicht von unabhängigen Unternehmen
im Ausland) importieren. Dies stärkt unsere Hypothese, dass Kostendruck im Inland
dazu führt, dass Dienstleistungen verstärkt aus dem kostengünstigen Ausland bezogen
werden.

The Determinants of Service Imports: The Role of Cost
Pressure and Financial Constraints1
1 Introduction
The 2007-2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession had an unprecedented impact
on global economic integration. In 2009, worldwide FDI inflows fell by 39% (UNCTAD,
2010), and the volume of world trade contracted by over 12% and therefore by more than
world GDP (IMF, 2010). In contrast to the general collapse of cross-border activities,
trade in services proved to be relatively resilient throughout the crisis. While German
manufacturing goods experienced a decrease in imports by 16.5%, the contraction of
commercial service imports by 7.7% appears comparably modest (see Figure A.1).2 This
becomes even more apparent if one abstracts from trade-related service categories like
transport services (see Figure A.2) which leads to the hypothesis that the determinants
of trade in goods and trade in services differ.
Borchert and Mattoo (2012) give three possible explanations for the apparent dif-
ferent behavior of trade in services. First, they state that the demand for services is
less cyclical than the demand for goods. Second, on the supply side, trade in services is
argued to be less dependent on external finance and therefore less susceptible to changes
in interest rates or credit conditions. Amiti and Weinstein (2009), Feenstra et al. (2011),
and Chor and Manova (2010) demonstrate that credit conditions act as financial frictions

2Note that this calculation is derived from World Bank data. Using the micro-level German Inter-
national Trade in Services (ITS) data, we calculate a 10% drop in service imports. The difference may
result from the fact that publicly reported aggregate statistics usually include earnings and expenditures
of the state, positions related to goods trade, import sales taxes, and ancillary services in transit trade in
addition to the service transactions of firms. Furthermore, they contain estimates (e.g. for transactions
below the reporting limit of e12,500) and collective reports which are excluded from the ITS data.
Finally, we adjust for negative reports that may occur if incorrect payments or cancellations were made.

which affect trade in manufactured goods, in particular for sectors which require exten-
sive external financing. Third, Borchert and Mattoo (2012) justify the crisis-resilience
of cross-border service trade with the cost pressures firms have to cope with. These
constraints may have forced firms into the international outsourcing of services that were
formerly conducted in-house. Following this line of argumentation, the financial and real
frictions to which firms are exposed affect trade in goods and trade in services differently.
The increasing role of services in the global economy has given rise to a growing re-
search interest in international services trade that has been supported by the availability
of firm-level data in recent years. Motivated by the lack of trade models developed for
services, researchers have started investigating the pattern of service trade and service
traders. Supporting the applicability of trade-in-goods models, Breinlich and Criscuolo
(2011) find that only a small fraction of UK firms are engaged in international trade
in services (either exports or imports, or both). The authors also report important dif-
ferences between traders and non-traders in terms of firm size, productivity and other
characteristics. In particular, service exporters and importers are larger and more pro-
ductive than non-traders, using more capital intensive production processes. Kelle and
Kleinert (2010) describe international trade in services using German data for 2005.
First, they argue that service trade is not limited to firms which are classified as service
firms, but that firms from all industries export and import services. Second, confirming
the reasoning of Breinlich and Criscuolo (2011), they report that the service trade of
German firms is dominated by only a few large multinationals, which are active in many
countries and which trade many different services. These trading patterns are very sim-
ilar for both importers and exporters of services. Using Italian firm-level data, Federico
and Tosti (2011) also confirm that trade in services is highly concentrated among the
top exporters and importers. Challenging the applicability of the trade-in-goods models,
Conti et al. (2010) find that a higher level of productivity and a higher skill intensity
affect the performances of exporting firms in the service sector only if the geographical
distance to their trading partners is large. Instead, the authors explain that the success of
service traders is due to their experience in the national market and with their belonging
2
to national as well as international networks.3
Since firm-level data on service trade have only recently become available, the few
existing studies have described the pattern of service trade and service traders but have
remained inconclusive about the factors which determine trade in services and whether
they differ from the factors which determine trade in goods. By focusing on the analysis
of the determinants of service imports of German multinationals, we complement the
existing literature. We put a special emphasis on potential differences to factors that
influence trade in manufactured goods.
We proceed as follows: first, we investigate the factors that affect the probability of
a firm being a service importer (extensive margin) ­ i.e. to offshore services which would
otherwise potentially be provided by domestic service suppliers ­ and intensifying exist-
ing linkages (intensive margin). Second, following the arguments of Borchert and Mattoo
(2012), we analyze the effect of internal cost pressures and of disruptions in external liq-
uidity on the supply side on both margins of cross-border service activities. Pressures to
save (wage) costs may force firms to offshore service tasks that were previously conducted
domestically. External liquidity constraints are supposed to play a major role for trade
in goods but may be less relevant for trade in services. Even though financial restric-
tions are especially important for exporters, they may also affect imports if problems
in (pre-)financing production lead to disruptions in the supply. Third, in addition to
the propensity and intensity of service offshoring, we study which factors influence the
channel (in-house versus arm's-length) through which firms import services.
We use comprehensive information on the cross-border service trade of German firms
for 2002-2008 from the German International Trade in Services Statistics (ITS) and
complement it with information on multinational service traders from the Micro Database
Direct Investment (MiDi) ­ both datasets are provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank.
Additionally, we make use of cross-country and cross-sectoral occupational wage data, as
3See also Kelle et al. (2012) who describe the patterns of service trade and traders for Germany, and
Walter and Dell'mour (2010) for Austria, or Temouri et al. (2010) who use a sample of German, French
and UK firms. Biewen and Blank (2012) give firm-level evidence on international trade in services for
Germany between 2001-2011 and analyze the contributions of the intensive and extensive margins to the
variations in firm-level and country-level service trade.

recently collected and prepared by Harsch and Kleinert (2011), which allow us to study
the impact of wages in much more detail than previously done in the literature.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains the description
of the merged ITS-MiDi data along with the explanatory variables. After explaining
the methodology in Section 3, the results are presented in Section 4. We find evidence
that a firm which is confronted with a decline in sales and sales per employee (labor
productivity) is less likely to start importing services. By contrast, firms that are already
service importers intensify existing linkages in times of cost pressures. Furthermore, firms
facing a drop in sales and labor productivity tend to increase their imports from foreign
affiliates rather than from independent suppliers. Credit constraints do not seem to have
any impact on service imports. Section 5 concludes.
2 Data
This section describes the data that we use for our empirical analysis. We combine
two micro datasets provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank ­ the ITS and the MiDi ­
and complement them with information on cross-country and cross-sectoral occupational
wages data as well as on credit constraints. After presenting the main data sources (2.1),
we lay out in detail which explanatory variables we use (2.2).
2.1 Micro Data
The ITS comprises information on all service transactions between German residents
and non-residents that surpass the threshold of e12,500. Since the reporting limit is
rather low, the ITS covers almost the entire population of German cross-border service
transactions. With the exception of mode 3 (commercial presence), the statistics include
all modes of service delivery that are defined in the General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS): cross-border trade (mode 1), consumption abroad (mode 2) and the
presence of natural persons (mode 4). The dataset has recently been made available for
research purposes for the years 2001 until 2010. In its original version, the ITS also
4
includes reports from public authorities and private transfers, which we remove in order
to focus on firms' transactions. For the empirical estimations, we restrict the sample to
the years for which our explanatory variables are available. Consequently, our sample is
reduced to the years 2003-2008.
The ITS reports comprehensive service trade information at the level of the individual
transaction (for both imports and exports): the value of the transaction, the type of the
traded service based on the classification of the Balance of Payments Statistics, the
country of the trade partner, and the NACE Rev. 1 industrial sector of the German
firm. While the information on the single service transaction is very detailed, the dataset
does not provide any firm-level characteristics. Thanks to a common firm identifier, some
firm-level information can, however, be retrieved from the MiDi.
The MiDi covers all international capital links from and to Germany (see Hügelschäf-
fer et al., 2009) and is available for research purposes as a panel dataset, currently cov-
ering the time period 1996-2009. It contains information on balance sheets of foreign
affiliates as well as their turnover and number of employees. While the report regarding
the foreign affiliates is very detailed, the information on the German investor comprises
only a few key variables, such as the balance sheet total, the turnover, the number of
employees, the industry (3/4-digit NACE Rev. 1), and the legal form. Since some of
these variables are only available from 2002 onward, we exclude all previous years.4 Be-
cause of the changes of the reporting thresholds for indirect (or second-tier) investments
in 2007, we limit our sample in this study to direct (or first-tier) investments.5 We also
make use of the information on the sector and the country in which the foreign affiliates
of the German investor operate ­ these two dimensions allow us to roughly differentiate
between intra-firm and arm's length trade.
Before matching the ITS and MiDi, we made a few adjustments. First, we aggregated
4For further information on this database, see Hügelschäffer et al. (2009).
5Since 2002, direct foreign investments (first-tier investments) have been subject to reporting require-
ments if a German investor holds at least 10% of the shares or voting rights in a direct investment
enterprise and if the balance sheet total of the latter exceeds e3 million. See Hügelschäffer et al. (2009)
and Foreign Direct Investment Stock Statistics (2012) for a detailed description of reporting require-
ments.

the individual service transactions in the ITS to the level of each firm, source country,
service type and year. We then dropped all remaining negative import values or values
that equal zero.6 Second, we grouped the single service categories in the ITS into eight
larger categories and assigned each industrial sector in which a foreign affiliate is active
according to the MiDi to a corresponding service group (see Table A.1). By doing
this, we implicitly assume that if a multinational German parent imports a particular
service (e.g. transport) from a certain country and at the same time has an affiliate in
this same country which operates in a sector similar to the imported service type (e.g.
transport), the transaction takes place between the parent and its affiliate. The described
adjustments enabled us to match the data on several dimensions ­ the firm, the year, the
country, and the service type (sector)7 and to broadly approximate intra-firm vs. arm's
length trade when we investigate the channels of international sourcing.8
Our matched sample consists of German service-importing firms that own at least
one affiliate abroad. In 2008, the last year in the sample, out of 28,476 service importers
only 2,701 firms also own at least one affiliate abroad. However, their joint import
value accounts for about 59% of total service imports (see Table A.3).9 On average,
these multinationals import more than three and a half times as much as their domestic
counterparts. We must keep in mind that by studying the service imports of multinational
firms only, our sample is restricted. This selectivity is, however, mitigated by the fact
that multinational firms are the driving force of international service trade.
2.2 Explanatory Variables
Our main variables of interest are measures of cost pressure and liquidity constraints.
By employing these variables, we aim at testing Borchert and Mattoo (2012)'s argument
that services trade and goods trade react differently to internal and external frictions.
6Negative or zero values may arise in the case of corrected or cancelled payments.
7See also Kelle et al. (2012) for a more detailed description of the matching process.
8Note that this procedure contains the risk of overestimating intra-firm trade. When interpreting the
results, we will keep in mind that they are rather lower-bound estimates for the international sourcing
of services from independent suppliers.
9Altomonte et al. (2012) show very similar results for France. While multinational business groups
represent only 10% of the trading firms, they account for almost 65% of exports and 62% of imports.
6
We assume that firms are exposed to cost pressure if they experience a decrease in
their sales or in their sales per employee from one year to another. We calculate changes
in sales and in sales per employee between the years t and t - 1 as
xit
=
xit
- xit-1
0.5 (xit
+ xit-1)
, (1)
where xit is the mid-point growth rate of firm-level sales (salesit) or sales per em-
ployee (prodit) of firm i. In contrast to conventional growth rates, mid-point growth rates
bearhave the advantage of keeping observations which are 0 in t - 1 (earlier applications
include Davis and Haltiwanger, 1992 and Buono et al., 2008).10
In principle, lower sales or sales per employee may have two opposing effects on
service imports. As a result of reduced sales levels, firms may limit their overall demand
for services which would eventually result in a decrease in imports. During the financial
crisis this decline proved, however, to be much less pronounced in services than in goods
trade. In order to save (wage) costs, firms may shift the services they use to cheaper
foreign countries which would then induce an increase in imports.
Liquidity constraints are likely to have an impact on the imports of goods whose
production requires substantial pre-financing of the employed intermediate inputs.11
Borchert and Mattoo (2012) argue that liquidity constraints may have a lower effect
on services imports because they bind less financial resources in their production. While
Chor and Manova (2010) use the interbank lending rate to measure the impact of credit
constraints on the crisis-related reduction of US imports, we use information on external
liquidity constraints from the financial structure database of Beck et al. (1999)12 and
employ the variable "claims on the private sector by deposit money banks and other
financial institutions over GDP". In order to arrive at the level of aggregated loans in
the trade partner country, we multiply the measure again with GDP. We then calculate
the mid-point growth rate of this variable as outlined above and obtain a proxy of the
10Note that growth rates can only be calculated for firms which have been present in the sample for
at least two years and which have not reported zero sales for two consecutive years.

evolution of the partner country's credit conditions over time.
We complement our set of explanatory variables with other variables that have been
suggested in previous literature. Given the lack of detailed information on inputs into
the production of services, we use labor productivity, defined as sales per employee, as
our productivity measure. Additionally, we take advantage of information on the foreign
ownership status of the investing firms. Altomonte and Ottaviano (2009) argue that
global supply chains had a non-neutral effect on the trade collapse during the financial
crisis. On the one hand, large multinationals are financed by globally operating insti-
tutions which were strongly hit by the crisis. Through this channel, foreign ownership
may have a negative impact on the intensive margin of service imports. On the other
hand, large multinationals may be more resilient to financial crises as they can alleviate
any temporary liquidity shortages of affiliates. We include a dummy variable and test
whether foreign ownership has an impact on a firm's service imports, in particular when
the firm faces an internal cost pressure.
To assess whether low wage costs in a country have induced firms to newly engage in
or to increase their service offshoring, we use comprehensive data on sector-specific cross-
country wages that were recently compiled by Harsch and Kleinert (2011). The data are
based on the International Labor Organization's October Inquiry which has in its raw
version hardly been used in the past. The by now cleaned, standardized and imputed
dataset contains wages for up to 161 occupations from 49 industries in 112 countries
between 1983 and 2008. As the dataset is still highly unbalanced and does not include
wage information on the same occupations for every country in each year, we cannot take
the median or mean wage across all occupations belonging to a certain sector. Instead,
we select one "representative" occupation per sector, which shows the greatest country
and year coverage within our sample (see Table A.2). The chosen occupations are all
low-skilled.
We estimate the probability and the level of service offshoring as gravity-type equa-
tions. For this purpose, we take bilateral great-circle distances between the most popu-
lated cities from CEPII. GDP is taken from the World Bank.
8
In addition to estimating the determinants of service offshoring, we assess the mode
choice of global sourcing (in-house versus arm's-length). Since firms cannot choose freely
between intra-firm and arm's-length trade, we estimate first the probability that a firm
had previously established an affiliate in the sector from which it wants to import. We
assume that this probability is influenced by the firm's "diversity". This variable draws
on evidence from Kelle et al. (2012) and Breinlich and Criscuolo (2011) and captures the
range of sectors and countries in which a firm owns affiliates. Higher diversity supposedly
helps firms to surpass the barrier of also having an affiliate in the import sector. We
then estimate the choice between arm's length and intra-firm imports by additionally
controlling for the experience a firm has in a certain market. We assume that a firm
has experience in a certain market if its ultimate owner originates from the country from
which the firm imports. The additional variables we use for the mode choice estimations
are both constructed from the MiDi. The descriptive statistics of all explanatory variables
are summarized in Table A.4.
3 Methodology
In our main estimations, we distinguish between the extensive margin (the probability of
service offshoring) and the intensive margin (the offshoring value). A Heckman selection
model allows us to model the service offshoring of multinational firms as a two-stage
process.
In the first stage, we estimate the determinants that affect the probability of being
a service importer by employing a simple probit model. For this purpose, we inflate
our dataset to include all firm-country-service type-year combinations for which we have
information on the explanatory variables. This strategy implicitly supposes that there
is a (potentially small) fixed cost that renders importing services profitable for some
but not for all firm-country-service type combinations.13 Hence, we use the information
contained in the zeros to model the selection into importing services. We estimate the

tion of the choice of a multinational firm to source services either through an affiliated
supplier (intra-firm trade) or through an independent supplier (arm's-length trade). Since
we know in which country and in which sector the foreign affiliates of German investors
operate, we can broadly sort service import transactions into the two sourcing modes: a
multinational firm is said to engage in arm's-length trade if it imports a service type from
a country in which it does not possess an affiliate that operates in the sector to which
the service type has been assigned. Following the same logic, it engages in intra-firm
trade if it imports a service type from a country where it also runs an affiliate operating
in the same sector. The admittedly broad categories ­ country and sector ­ form the
criteria along which we sort service transactions into sourcing modes (intra-firm versus
arm's-length service imports).16
In order to analyze through which channel a firm imports services, we have to con-
dition our sample on firms that have foreign affiliates in sectors corresponding to the
imported services types. Since the decision to set up a foreign affiliate is not random,
but depends on some systematic factors such as the fixed costs or the firm's productivity,
firms cannot freely choose between sourcing a service from an affiliated or from an inde-
pendent supplier. Not accounting for this sample selectivity concern would lead to biased
regression coefficients. Hence, we apply a Heckman-type selection model similar to the
one outlined in equations (2)-(4), but with the difference that the outcome equation is
again a probit equation. We first estimate the likelihood that a multinational firm has
an affiliate in the service sector k. Then, we assess the probability of outsourcing yikjt,out
­ conditional on the firm having an affiliate in sector k. The decision to source from an
independent or an affiliated supplier is driven by variations in firm, sector and country
characteristics:
yikjt,out
= 1Yout
+ 2xit
+ 3creditjt
+ 4millsikjt,out
+ uikjt,out > 0 , (5)
16In 2008, out of the 2,701 multinational service importers, only 266 were classified as intra-firm traders
using the above definition. These imported, on average, an over six times greater value than arm's-length
traders (see Table A.5).

where Yout
is again the vector of other explanatory variables, xit the growth rate of
sales (per employee) and creditjt the change in the availability of credit. millsikjt,out is
the inverse Mills ratio obtained from the selection equation and uikjt,out the error term.
4 Results
This section presents the results of estimating the determinants of service offshoring (4.1)
and the determinants of the mode choice for the sourcing of these services (4.2) as well
as robustness checks (4.3).
4.1 Determinants of Service Offshoring
For our empirical estimations, we restrict the sample to firms for which our main variables
of interest are available. As we calculate internal cost pressure as the change in sales
(salesit) and in labor productivity (prodit) between t and t-1, our estimation sample
is reduced to the years 2003-2008.
In the first stage of the Heckman procedure, we estimate the probability of a multi-
national firm being a service importer (extensive margin). Because firms concentrate
their service activities on only a limited number of countries and service types, the num-
ber of firm-year-country-service type-year combinations equal to zero by far exceeds the
number of ones in the inflated dataset. In fact, we observe service imports for only
0.4% of all firm-country-service type combinations. Since the high ratio of zeros results
in extremely low marginal effects and increases the computation time substantially, we
randomly draw a 5% sample of all zeros. In the second stage, we estimate the offshoring
intensity (intensive margin).
Extensive Margin
The results of the first stage estimation are given in the upper part of Table 1. They
show that productivity has a positive and significant effect on the probability of a firm
importing services from abroad. The result that more productive firms are more likely to
12
engage in international trade is in line with the vast evidence on trade in goods.17 Table
1 further shows that firms also tend to source from nearby countries with a high GDP
but low wages in the sector supplying the respective service. These results are highly
significant at the 1%-level after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity at the country-,
sector-, service type, and year-level. Firms with a foreign ultimate beneficial owner are
more likely to import services than firms with a German ultimate beneficial owner and
are, hence, better able to overcome entry barriers. All these results are very robust to
the inclusion of additional variables.
Turning to our main variables of interest, we include internal cost pressure and ex-
ternal liquidity constraints as explanatory variables (see Columns (3)-(8)). Both the
growth rate of sales and the growth rate of sales per employee (labor productivity) ex-
hibit a positive impact on the probability of service offshoring. Or, to put it differently,
if firms experience a decline in sales or labor productivity, the likelihood that they will
import services from abroad also decreases. Even though the costs of sourcing services
may be lower compared with the costs of sourcing goods, it seems plausible that the
probability of importing a service type from abroad decreases if a firm is under cost
pressure. The effect is higher for foreign-owned firms, as the positive interaction effect
indicates.
We test the external finance channel measured as the mid-point growth rate of cred-
its. In line with the argument of Borchert and Mattoo (2012), we find no evidence that
external credit constraints are of importance for services imports. One possible explana-
tion is that the fixed costs of service traders are well below the fixed costs involved in
trade in goods. Consequently, the need for finance on the supply side (e.g. for financing
the production of services) is limited and does not significantly influence the imports of
services.
Taken together, these results indicate that internal cost pressures are more important
17While the literature on the (positive) link between productivity and goods exports is extensive (see,
for instance, Bernard and Jensen (1999), Bernard et al. (2003), or Wagner (2007) for a survey of the
existing studies), only a few studies concentrate on imports. A positive effect of productivity on firm's
imports is found e.g. in Vogel and Wagner (2010) for German manufacturing firms in 2001-2005 (see
also Vogel and Wagner (2010) for a literature overview regarding importing and productivity).

Intensive Margin
Next, we investigate the determinants of the level of service imports. The results are given
in the lower part of Table 1. From the baseline model (Column 2), it becomes evident
that a multinational firm's labor productivity positively affects service imports also in
terms of imported values. A higher wage level in the sector and country from where the
imports originate decreases them. This is again in line with the hypothesis that firms
offshore service activities to save wage costs. The gravity variables, GDP and distance,
have the expected sign and are mostly significant. Foreign ownership negatively impacts
the intensive margin of service imports. Hence, whereas foreign ownership increases the
likelihood of service offshoring (as indicated by the positive coefficient in the upper part
of Table 1), it decreases its level (as indicated by the negative coefficient in the lower
part of Table 1).
From Column (3) onward, we add firm-level measures of cost pressure. Columns
(3)-(5) show that a sales drop between t and t - 1 significantly increases the level of
service imports. This effect is stronger for domestically-owned than for foreign-owned
firms. The inclusion of a drop in labor productivity, as measured by a drop in sales
per employee, from Column (6) onward, exhibits a similar but even stronger impact
than the sales drop. While high internal cost pressures seem to prevent firms from
becoming a service importer (results from the first stage of the Heckman estimation), they
intensify already existing linkages. Reasoning in terms of Borchert and Mattoo (2012),
a reduced sales or productivity level puts pressure on the firm to save production costs
and eventually intensifies the import of services from foreign producers. Furthermore,
the higher coefficient of the productivity drop variable indicates that a reduced sales
level becomes especially problematic for firms if it is generated by an equal amount of
employees, i.e. if the firm is not instantaneously able to adjust its workforce. Likewise,
the interaction effect is also more pronounced. A productivity drop harms domestically-
owned multinationals more than foreign-owned multinationals which seem to be better
able to absorb the increased cost pressure. This latter effect is in line with the literature
that claims a higher crisis-resilience of global value chains.
16
Furthermore, we do not find any evidence that a deterioration in credit conditions
lowers service trade in a similar way as it affected trade in goods during the recent crisis
(Columns (5) and (8)).
4.2 Determinants of Service Sourcing Modes
In addition to the determinants of service offshoring, we analyze which factors influence
the mode through which firms import services. The results of estimating a two-stage
Heckman-type selection model are summarized in Table 2.
Surprisingly, Column (2) suggests that the probability of having an affiliate in sector
k is not driven by the labor productivity of the multinational firm. Being diverse in the
sense of owning affiliates in a wide range of sectors and countries does, however, help
firms to overcome the entry barrier and makes it more likely that a multinational firm
will buy or establish an additional affiliate in sector k. Kelle et al. (2012) use a similar
variable as a proxy for productivity and also find that it is a strong predictor of service
trade. Wages have the expected negative effect on the dependent variable except for the
specification in which we control for credit constraints in the outcome equation.
In contrast to the missing link between productivity and owning an affiliate in sector k
in the selection equation, productivity is found to negatively impact the decision to source
from an independent supplier in the outcome equation. Wages again exercise a negative
influence, the coefficient being highly significant at the 1% level. Thus, the lower the
wage costs in a sector and country from which the multinational firm imports, the higher
the propensity that the firm will do so at arm's length. This result is in line with the
observation that multinational firms pay wage premia which make independent suppliers
competitive especially in low cost environments. Foreign ownership is not significant in
any of the specifications. As expected, experience in a foreign market (defined as the
nationality of the ultimate owner) is positively associated with the likelihood of sourcing
through independent suppliers.
In Columns (3)-(8), we introduce again our cost pressure variables. A positive growth
rate of sales and labor productivity increases the probability of arm's-length importing
17
and, accordingly, a negative growth rate decreases it. Hence, ceteris paribus, given a
certain sales and productivity level of the firm, a drop in these measures induces firms to
sort into intra-firm trading. In the case of productivity, this effect is stronger for domestic
firms as indicated by the negative interaction effect. As before, credit constraints do not
play any role.18

18The previous literature has shown that the decision to source from an independent supplier depends
on the institutional quality in the source country (see, in particular, Antras and Helpman, 2008). In
unreported estimations, we added variables capturing the quality of regulation and the level of corruption
in a country. These variables did not have any significant effect. Results are available from the authors
upon request.

4.3 Robustness Checks
In Section 4.1, we estimated the service offshoring probability and intensity using the
entire sample, i.e. we pooled all different service types together. While goods trade-
related services, particulary transport services, were hit especially hard in the aftermath
of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the decline in business services proved to be moderate.
Our descriptive statistics presented in Figure A.2 confirm this: the 2009 decrease in
transport services measured in terms of both import values and number of importers
was large compared to, for instance, R&D, data processing, management and personnel
services. Therefore, the inclusion of transport services in the sample might have pushed
the effects of internal cost pressures and external finance in the direction of goods imports.
In what follows, we repeat the estimations for a sample from which we exclude transport
services. We expect the determinants of service imports to differ even more from those
of goods imports.
Table 3 reports the results of this exercise. The results of the first stage of the
Heckman approach differ only slightly from the results presented for the entire sample
(Table 1). The signs do not change. The probability of offshoring increases with labor
productivity, but the effect is ­ as expected ­ smaller compared with the sample includ-
ing transport services. The offshoring probability decreases with higher wage costs in
the sector and country from where the imports are sourced. These results are highly
significant at the 1%-level. GDP and distance have the expected sign and are also signif-
icant. Both cost pressure measures, the growth rate of sales and the growth rate of sales
per employee (labor productivity), again exhibit a positive impact on the probability of
service offshoring, but are mostly of smaller magnitude. In line with expectations, in
times of decreasing sales (per employee) firms which import business services still behave
similarly to goods importers and are less likely to start importing, but this tendency
is lower when goods-related services are excluded. Similar to the sample including all
service types, the coefficient of external liquidity remains insignificant. However, the sign
changes from negative to positive.
The results of the second stage of the Heckman estimation confirm that the intensity
19
of service offshoring is less responsive to labor productivity when trade in goods-related
services is excluded (cf. Tables 1 and 3). It is more responsive to foreign ownership. The
finding that foreign-owned investors offshore less and that this effect is stronger in the
reduced sample underlines the particular role of transport services. The size of the wage
coefficient remains similar in both samples.
Most interestingly, service offshoring also proves to be more responsive to sales or
productivity drops if the sample is limited to business services. The higher coefficient
therefore strengthens the hypothesis that firms which experience cost pressures offshore
more rather than less services. This reaction helps explain the absence of a collapse in
service trade in times of recession. Again, changes in the availability of external finance
do not influence service trade.

5 Conclusions
The financial crisis in the years 2007-2008 and the resulting recession had a strong impact
on international trade in goods. In contrast to the general decrease of cross-border
activities, trade in services proved to be relatively resilient. This has led to the hypothesis
that the determinants of trade in goods and trade in services differ substantially. While
the former are very well studied, little is known about the latter. Research on the factors
that influence service trade has been conducted at the macro level. Micro level datasets
have only recently become available, and have so far been explored with the aim of
describing the general pattern of service trade and service traders. As a consequence,
Borchert and Mattoo (2012)'s arguments that the greater resilience of service trade may,
amongst others, stem from a lower dependence on external finance and from the tendency
of firms under cost pressure to offshore services that were formerly provided domestically,
have remained untested.
This study has filled the gap in the literature. By combining new data on German
service trade at the transaction level with existing data on multinational firms, we have
studied the determinants of service imports. We have put a special emphasis on inves-
tigating the potential differences compared with factors that influence trade in goods.
Using a Heckman-type selection model, our first stage results indicate that firms which
are confronted with a decline in sales and sales per employee (labor productivity) are
less likely to become a service importer. By contrast, our second stage results suggest
that firms which are already service importers intensify the existing linkages in times
of internal cost pressures. Credit constraints which play an important role in trade in
goods do not seem to have an impact on service imports. The results were strongly
confirmed when we excluded goods trade-related services, such as transportation, from
the estimation sample.
Our results partly support the arguments of Borchert and Mattoo (2012): the prob-
ability of firms becoming service importers decreases when they face internal cost pres-
sures. This is not unexpected, but seems to be rather in line with the previous literature
22
on trade in goods and cannot explain the crisis-resilience of service trade. However, the
level of service offshoring increases in the light of internal cost pressures. Both margins
are unaffected by supply-side credit shortages. These latter results support Borchert
and Mattoo (2012)'s hypotheses. Such findings are relevant to other researchers since
they show that firm-level models developed for trade in goods are only partly applicable
to trade in services. They are also of significance for policymakers. In times of cost
pressure, firms are unlikely to replace domestic suppliers with foreign suppliers. They
tend, however, to intensify existing relationships abroad, which may in the long run drive
domestic firms out of the market.
