Context.--Previous studies have documented that cancer patients tend to
overestimate the probability of long-term survival. If patient preferences about the
trade-offs between the risks and benefits associated with alternative treatment
strategies are based on inaccurate perceptions of prognosis, then treatment
choices may not reflect each patient's true values.
Objective.--To test the hypothesis that among terminally ill cancer patients an
accurateunderstandingofprognosisisassociatedwithapreferencefortherapythat
focuses on comfort over attempts at life extension.
Design.--Prospective cohort study.
Setting.--Five teaching hospitals in the United States.
Patients.--A total of 917 adults hospitalized with stage III or IV non­small cell
lung cancer or colon cancer metastatic to liver in phases 1 and 2 of the Study to
Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments
(SUPPORT).
Main Outcome Measures.--Proportion of patients favoring life-extending
therapy over therapy focusing on relief of pain and discomfort, patient and physi-
cian estimates of the probability of 6-month survival, and actual 6-month survival.
Results.--Patientswhothoughttheyweregoingtoliveforatleast6monthswere
more likely (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3.7) to favor life-
extending therapy over comfort care compared with patients who thought there was
at least a 10% chance that they would not live 6 months. This OR was highest (8.5;
95% CI, 3.0-24.0) among patients who estimated their 6-month survival probability
at greater than 90% but whose physicians estimated it at 10% or less. Patients
overestimated their chances of surviving 6 months, while physicians estimated
prognosis quite accurately. Patients who preferred life-extending therapy were
more likely to undergo aggressive treatment, but controlling for known prognostic
factors, their 6-month survival was no better.
Conclusions.--Patients with metastatic colon and lung cancer overestimate
their survival probabilities and these estimates may influence their preferences
about medical therapies.

MOST METASTATIC solid tumors, in-
cluding lung and colon cancer, are incur-
able and life expectancy is short. Cancer
patients and their physicians are often
facedwithafundamentalchoicebetween
cancer-directed therapy and supportive
care that emphasizes symptom manage-
ment rather than control of the underly-
ing disease. Even in incurable solid tu-
mors, cancer-directed therapy may pro-
long average life expectancy by several
months and palliate symptoms in some
but is often associated with treatment-
related toxic effects. There is substantial
variability in the choices that are made
about these alternatives. For example,
among patients diagnosed as having
metastatic colon cancer in 1990, 42% re-
ceived chemotherapy as a component of
their treatment, while 58% did not.1
For editorial comment see p 1746.
We believe that patient preferences
should drive choices between alternative
therapies,especiallywhenlifeexpectancy
varies little and quality-of-life consider-
ations are prominent. Cancer patients'
ability to participate in making decisions
abouttheircaremaybelimitedbyseveral
factors, however. Some patients may be
too ill or too overwhelmed emotionally to
play a major role in establishing the goals
oftherapy.Amongthosewhowishtopar-
ticipate, potential barriers include lack of
physician support for patient decision
making,insufficientpatientknowledgeof
the likely outcomes of their disease, and
lack of information concerning the effect
of alternative strategies on outcomes.
Several studies have documented that
cancer patients' understanding of their
prognosis is imperfect and that they tend
to overestimate the probability of long-
termsurvival.2-6 Forexample,in1survey

Patients' preferences for care reflect
their values, their understanding of their
illness,andtheirunderstandingoftherisks
and benefits associated with treatment
choices.7-10 Studiesofcancerpatients'val-
ues regarding trade-offs between quality
and quantity of life have shown substan-
tial interpatient variability.11-13 If pa-
tients do not understand their prognoses
accurately, then their decisions about
trade-offsbetweentreatmentchoicesmay
not reflect their true values.
Weexaminedtherelationshipbetween
cancer patients' estimates of their prog-
nosis and their life-support and treat-
ment preferences. The objectives of the
analysis were to determine (1) whether
patients'prognosticestimateswereinde-
pendent predictors of their treatment
choice, (2) whether patients' prognostic
estimates were concordant with their
physicians' estimates, (3) whether pa-
tients' or physicians' estimates were
more accurate, and (4) whether patients'
treatment preferences influenced their
medical outcomes.
METHODS
Study Population
Patients enrolled in phases 1 and 2 of
the Study to Understand Prognoses and
Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of
Treatments (SUPPORT) were eligible
for the study. Although the study in-
cluded hospitalized patients with any of
9 different diagnoses, only data pertain-
ing to patients with non­small cell lung
cancer and colon cancer will be present-
ed in this report. A full description of the
SUPPORTprojectobjectivesandmeth-
ods has been published previously.14
Phase 1 was a prospective observa-
tionalstudythatdescribedtheprocessof
decision making and patient outcomes.
Phase 2 was a cluster-randomized, con-
trolled clinical trial to test the effect of
an intervention in which physicians were
provided with information about both
prognosis and patient preferences and in
whichanurseattemptedtofacilitatecom-
munication to enhance decision making.
Enrollment, data collection, and inter-
viewing were virtually identical during
the 2 phases.15 Phase 1 enrolled patients
from June 1989 through June 1991, and
phase 2 enrolled patients from January
1992 through January 1994. Patients
were enrolled at the time of hospitaliza-
tion at 1 of 5 medical centers (Beth Israel
Hospital,Boston,Mass;DukeUniversity
Medical Center, Durham, NC; Metro-
Health Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio;
St Joseph's Hospital/Marshfield Clinic,
Marshfield, Wis; and University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles, Medical Center. No
differences in any of 5 outcome measures
(timing of do not resuscitate orders, pa-
tient and physician agreement on prefer-
encesregardingresuscitation,daysspent
in the intensive care unit while in coma
or receiving mechanical ventilation, fre-
quency and severity of pain, and hospital
resourceuse)werefoundbetweenphases
1 and 2.15 Therefore, in the analyses pre-
sented herein, patients from the 2 phases
are pooled in a single sample.
To be eligible for the diagnostic cat-
egory of non­small cell lung cancer, pa-
tients were required to be hospitalized
with non­small cell lung cancer, stage
III or IV. To be eligible for the diagnos-
tic category of colon cancer, they were
required to be hospitalized with colon
cancer metastatic to the liver. Patients
whose conditions had been newly diag-
nosed (within 1 month) and who were
hospitalized for the first time since diag-
nosis, as well as patients who had been
hospitalized for reasons unrelated to
their cancer, were ineligible. Patients
were excluded from enrollment in
SUPPORT if they were non­English
speaking,hadaplannedadmissionofless
than72hours,werepregnant,orhaddied
or been discharged from the hospital
within 48 hours of study entry.
All study patients were asked to iden-
tifyasurrogatedecisionmaker,whompa-
tients "would want to help [their] doc-
tor[s]makeadecisionabout[their]medical
careif[they]weretooilltodoso."Forpa-
tientswhowereunabletodesignateasur-
rogate,thephysicianand/ornextofkinwas
asked to name a surrogate. Physicians in-
terviewedwerethoseidentifiedbyadmis-
sion records as the responsible physician
and were confirmed by physician inter-
view to be the individual having primary
responsibility for that patient's care.
Data Collection
Data were gathered prospectively by
chartreview,patientinterview,andsur-
rogate interview. An attempt was al-
ways made to interview the surrogate
even if patient data were complete.
Chart reviews were performed by
trained research nurses, while inter-
views were performed by trained inter-
viewers. Data collected by chart review
included in this analysis were insurance,
disease type, disease stage, time from
cancer diagnosis, number of readmis-
sions to the study hospital, resuscita-
tions attempted,anddeathwhilereceiv-
ing ventilatory assistance.
Data collected by patient and/or surro-
gate interview included demographics
(age, sex, race, education, income); global
quality of life (rated on a single-item scale
from0-100);activitiesofdailyliving(ADL)
using a modified Katz ADL scale16,17;
patient's estimates of the probability of
2-and6-monthsurvival;andpatient'spref-
erence for receiving life-extending treat-
ment. Regarding their prognoses, pa-
tients were specifically asked, "What are
thechancesthatyouwilllivefor2months
or more if the current plan of care stays
the same?" and "How about 6 months or
more?"Patientswereaskedtochoosefrom
the following responses: "90% or better,"
"about 75%," "about 50-50," "about 25%,"
"10% or less," or "don't know." Regard-
ingtreatmentpreferences,theywerespe-
cificallyasked,"Ifyouhadtomakeachoice

treatment that focuses on extending life
as much as possible, even if it means hav-
ingmorepainanddiscomfort,orwouldyou

ingpainanddiscomfort,evenifthatmeans
notlivingaslong?"Responseoptionswere
"extendlifeasmuchaspossible,""relieve
pain or discomfort as much as possible,"
and "don't know."
Information obtained by physician in-
terviewincludedphysicianestimatesfor
the patient's likelihood of survival at 6
months. This question was asked prior
to providing any computer-based prog-
nosticinformationtophysiciansinphase
2.Physicianswereaskedtorespondwith
a number ranging from 0% to 100% to
the question "What is the probability
that this patient will live for 6 months
or more?"
Statistical Methods
Bivariable analysis and a logistic re-
gression model were used to test the re-
lationshipbetweenpatient-prognostices-
timatesandtheirtreatmentpreferences.
The fit of a logistic regression model was
assessedbytheHosmer-Lemeshowgood-
ness-of-fittest.18 Asecondaryanalysiswith
stratification by the physician-prognos-
tic estimates was performed. Physician-
prognosticestimatesweremeasuredasa

parison with patients, these estimates
were grouped into 5 categories similar to
those available to the patients (90%,
61%-89%, 40%-60%, 11%-39%, and 10%).
Correlation coefficients for patient esti-

ingthesensitivityandspecificityofthetest
or prediction at various criteria of positiv-
ity. The greater the area under the curve
(onascaleof0.5-1),thebetterthediscrimi-
nation of the test or prediction. The sensi-
tivity of the patients' estimates at a crite-
rion of positivity of 90%, for example,
represented, among patients who lived 6
months or more, the ratio of the number
who estimated their probability of being
alive at 6 months at 90% or higher to the
totalnumberofpatientsinthesubset.The
specificity of the "test" at this criterion of
positivityrepresented,amongpatientswho
lived less than 6 months, the ratio of the
number of patients who estimated their
probabilityofbeingaliveat6monthsatless
than 90% to the total number of patients
in this subset.
Thedegreeofcorrelationbetweenpa-
tientandphysicianprognosticestimates
was evaluated with a -b statistic.20 Bi-
variable analysis and a logistic regres-
sion model were used to test the rela-
tionship between patients' treatment
preferences and their 6-month survival.
The relationship between treatment
preference and occurrence of adverse
events was evaluated with a 2 statistic.
When information on income, educa-
tion, functional status, or quality of life
was not available, we substituted surro-
gate reports, calibrated to patient re-
sponseorimputedvaluesusingmethods
described previously.21
Only patients for whom patient or sur-
rogate prognostic estimates were avail-
ablewereincludedintheanalysis(n=917,
63% of otherwise eligible subjects). For
somepatients,dataonperceivedprogno-
sis were not available because they were
cognitively impaired, intubated, or oth-
erwise too ill to participate in the inter-
view. All analyses involving patient esti-
mates of prognoses were performed on 2
data sets. The first data set included only
those patients who provided an estimate
of the probability of their being alive at 6
months (n=546). In the second data set
(n=917), when patient estimates were
missing but a surrogate estimate of the
probabilityofbeingaliveat6monthswas
available, this value, adjusted in accor-
dance with the observed relationship be-
tweensurrogateandpatientestimatesin
the group for whom both variables were
present, was used to replace missing val-
ues (n=271). When a surrogate estimate
of the probability of the patient's being
alive at 6 months was not available, the
patient'sestimateoftheprobabilityofthe
patient's being alive at 2 months, cubed,
was used in place of the missing value
(n=33). (The 6-month probability of be-
ing alive would equal the cube of the 2-
monthprobabilityofbeingaliveifthehaz-
ard function were constant.) For the re-
maining patients used in this analysis,
onlyasurrogateestimateoftheprobabil-
ity of being alive at 2 months was avail-
able, and this value cubed was used in
place of the missing value (n=67). There
were no meaningful differences between
the 2 data sets in any of the analyses;
therefore, only the results from the sec-
ond data set are reported here.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of all eligible sub-
jects are shown in Table 1. The average
age of study patients was 62 years. Most
(84%) were white, and 62% were male.
Thirty-nine percent of the patients had
metastatic colon cancer and 61% had
lung cancer, most of which were stage
IV. At 6 months of follow-up, 500 (55%)
of the 917 patients had died. Character-
istics of patients not included in the
analysis because data on their 6-month
survival estimates were not available
proved to be similar to study patients
exceptthatahigherproportionhadnon­
small cell lung cancer and their 6-month
survival was poorer. These patients also
had slightly lower incomes, fewer years
of education, and poorer scores on qual-
ity-of-life and ADL scales. Characteris-
tics of patients for whom data on pref-
erences for life-extending therapy were
missing (34%) were similar to patients
forwhomthisinformationwasavailable,
although they were also more likely to
have non­small cell lung cancer, their
mean age was 1 year higher, and they
had slightly poorer 6-month survival,
lower incomes, and poorer scores on
quality-of-life and ADL scales.
Preferences
The distribution of patient 6-month
survival estimates and their prefer-
ences for life-extending therapy and ac-
tual survival stratified by their prognos-
tic estimates are shown in Table 2.
Because there were relatively few pa-
tients in each category below 75%, pa-
tient-estimated prognosis at 6 months
was treated as a dichotomous variable
(90% vs 90%) in analyses of the rela-
tionship between survival estimates and
preference for life-extending therapy

(Table 3). In unadjusted analyses, the
patients who estimated their probability
of being alive at 6 months to be 90% or
better were more likely to favor life-
extending therapy (odds ratio [OR], 2.6;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3.7)
(Table3).TheORforthiscomparisonwas
unchanged in logistic regression models
that examined the need to adjust for age,
sex, race, education, income, insurance,
disease site and stage, time since diagno-
sis,functionalstatus,andglobalqualityof
life (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=.54 for final
model).Astatisticallysignificantrelation-
ship between patient-prognostic esti-
matesandtreatmentpreferenceswasob-
served in both phase 1 and phase 2. In
addition, no significant difference in pa-
tientpreferenceorintherelationshipbe-
tween patient-prognostic estimates and
preference was observed between inter-
vention and control patients in phase 2.
Stratification of patients by physician
estimate of survival demonstrated that
therelationshipbetweenperceivedprog-
nosis and desire for life-extending
therapy was particularly strong among
patientswhosephysiciansbelievedthem
to have a poor prognosis. For example,
among patients whose physicians esti-
mated a less than 10% probability of 6-
month survival, the odds of patients who
thought they had a 90% probability of 6-
month survival choosing life-extending
therapywere8.5timeshigherthanthose
of patients in this category who thought
theyhadlessthan90%probabilityofsur-
viving 6 months (Table 3). The progres-
sive increase in the OR for the relation-
ship of self-perceived prognosis to desire
for life-extending therapy with declin-
ing physician estimates of the probabil-
ity of 6-month survival was statistically
significant (P=.02).
Comparison of Patient and
Physician Estimates of Survival
Patients were substantially more op-
timisticabouttheirprognosesthantheir
physicians were (-b = 0.29) (Table 4). In
82% of physician-patient pairs, the pa-
tients' estimate of their chance of living
6 months was higher than the physi-
cians'; in 59%, the patient estimate ex-
ceededthephysicianestimateby2prog-
nostic categories or more.
Patient- and Physician-Prognostic
Estimate Accuracy Comparison
The percentage of patients actually
surviving 6 months or more within each
physician- and patient-prognostic cat-
egory is shown in Table 5. Although pa-
tients who believed they had at least a
90% probability of surviving 6 months
lived longer than patients who were less
optimistic about their prognoses (Table
5), physician estimates were better cali-
brated than those of patients. The dis-
crimination of physician and patient es-
timates of the probability of surviving 6
months were compared with ROC
curves. Using this technique, physician
estimates of survival were significantly
more accurate than patient estimates,
with ROC curve areas of 0.78 and 0.66,
respectively (P.0001).

times more likely to experience a read-

suscitation, or death while receiving
ventilatory assistance (42/146 [29%])
than patients who preferred therapy di-
rected at pain relief (29/159 [18%])
(P=.03). In bivariable analysis, patients
who preferred life-extending therapy
were more likely to be alive at 6 months
(P=.005). However, in a logistic regres-
sion model that controlled for age, race,
sex, education, income, insurance sta-
tus, site and stage of disease, functional
status, overall quality of life, and physi-
cian-prognostic estimates, there was no
statistically significant difference in 6-
month survival between those who fa-
vored life-extending therapy and those
who did not (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=.17
for final model).
COMMENT
In a large cohort of terminally ill can-
cer patients, we found that how patients
estimated their prognoses influenced
their treatment preferences. Specifi-
cally, patients who believed that they
would survive for at least 6 months fa-
vored life-extending therapy over com-
fort care at more than double the rate of
those who believed that there was at
leastasmallchance(aslittleas10%)that
they would not live 6 months. This asso-
ciationwasmostmarkedinpatientswho
were optimistic about their probability
of surviving 6 months despite physician
estimates to the contrary. In addition,
we found that patients greatly overesti-
mated their chances of surviving 6
months, while physician-prognostic es-
timates were more accurate. Finally, we
found that patients who expressed a
preference for life-extending therapy
were more likely to undergo aggressive
treatment, but controlling for known
prognostic factors, their 6-month sur-
vival was no better.
This study confirms the findings of a
number of smaller case series showing
thatcancerpatientstendtooverestimate
their prognoses.2-6 But it is the first to
demonstrate that patients' beliefs about
their prognoses are associated with their

*Of the 917 patients in the analytic sample, 311 had missing data on preference for life-extending therapy, and
95 additional patients had missing data for physician estimate of 6-month survival; therefore, these patients are not
included in rows 1-5 and the "n" for these rows is 511 (917 - 311 - 95). Because the "Total" row is not stratified by
physician estimate of survival, these 95 patients are included in that row, resulting in an "n" of 606 (511 + 95).
The increase in odds ratio with decreasing physician estimate of 6-month survival is statistically significant
(P = .02). CI indicates confidence interval.

justifications that has been offered for
withholdingprognosticinformationfrom
patients with a terminal disease is that,
while promoting quality of life by main-

and comfort care--may be highly influ-
enced by their understanding of their
prognoses. These results are consistent
withtheempiricdatademonstratingthat
patient preferences about resuscitation
dependonthenatureoftheexpectedout-
comes.23-28 Ourfindingstakethisworkone
step further by showing that a patient's
preference about overall therapy goals is
also associated with his or her perceived
prognosis.
Whataretheimplicationsofthisstudy
for patient care? One possible interpre-
tation of the findings is that enhanced
communicationfromphysiciantopatient
about prognosis could help patients
make better-informed treatment deci-
sions that are more consonant with their
values. The observed relationship be-
tween patient preferences for life-ex-
tending therapy and their likelihood of
experiencing aggressive therapy and
adverse events suggests that this com-
munication might also diminish patient
suffering at the end of life. Our data sug-
gest that these efforts might be particu-
larly helpful in patients with poorer
prognoses. Most importantly, we found
that it is not necessary for patients to
have a precise understanding of their
prognoses to alter their treatment pref-
erences. Study patients who simply un-
derstood that there was at least a 10%
probability that they might not survive
6monthsexpressedsubstantiallydiffer-
ent treatment preferences from those
whodidnot.Thissuggeststhatitmaybe
quite possible both to maintain patient
hope and to provide sufficient prognos-
tic information so that patients would be
abletomaketreatmentdecisionsconsis-
tent with their underlying values.29,30
One important lesson from phase 2 of
SUPPORT is that an understanding of
the sources of patients' beliefs, and pref-
erences, and of the processes by which
they arrive at decisions about their care
may be critical to designing interven-
tions that are effective in changing end-
of-life patterns of care and communica-
tion. Although our data provide compel-
ling evidence that the cancer patients
participating in this study did not have
anaccurateunderstandingoftheirprog-
noses,datawerenotcollectedthatwould
allow us to identify what was driving
these estimates. In particular, we do not
know what sources of prognostic infor-
mation patients used, how and whether
physicians provided accurate prognos-
tic estimates to patients, and why pa-
tients did not understand them or chose
not to believe them. Analysis of the ac-
curacy of patient-prognostic estimates
in the SUPPORT cohort as a whole
showed no association with study site,
disease category, or whether patients
were in the intensive care unit.31 This
suggests that there may be pervasive
and fundamental barriers to effective
communication about prognosis among
seriouslyillpatientsthatshouldbemore
fully investigated if effective interven-
tionstoaddressthemaretobedesigned.
Our findings with respect to influence
of patient-prognostic estimates on their
treatment preferences, and, in turn, of
those preferences on actual patterns of
care, highlight the critical importance
of gaining a better understanding of the
sources of these estimates.
Severallimitationsofthisstudydesign
should be noted. First, because data on
patient- or surrogate-perceived progno-
sis were available for only 63% of other-
wise eligible study subjects, the results
may not be generalizable to all patients
with these incurable solid tumors. And
although the patients for whom data on
perceived prognosis or treatment pref-
erence were missing resembled those
with complete data with respect to most
sociodemographic and clinical variables,
these patients did have slightly lower in-
comes, quality-of-life scores and ADL,
and a higher proportion had lung cancer
and died within 6 months of study enroll-
ment. Questions asked of the terminally
ill patients in this study are difficult ones
and, despite considerable investment in
study procedures designed to minimize
missing data, response rates were not
ideal.Weattemptedtoaddressthisprob-
lem by including subjects for whom only
surrogates' estimates of prognoses were
available, and it was reassuring to find
that this did not alter any of the findings
of the study. But it is important to recog-
nize that our results describe the beliefs
and preferences of only those patients
who were willing to share their views
with the study team and should not be
generalized to the entire population.
Generalizability is also limited by the
fact that all patients participating in this
studywerehospitalizedfortreatmentof
their disease or disease-related compli-
cations at an academic medical center.
The characteristics of hospitalized pa-
tients may differ in systematic ways
from those of ambulatory patients. Fur-
thermore, patients opting for care in an
academic setting may be especially in-
terested in obtaining state-of-the-art or
aggressive therapy. Future studies in
different settings would be valuable in
elucidatingtheinfluenceofthesefactors
on the relationship between patient per-
ceptionofprognosisandtreatmentpref-
erences.
Finally, and most importantly, dem-
onstration of an association between
self-perceived prognosis and treatment
preference does not prove a causal rela-

tionship.Itispossiblethatthesameper-
sonality traits or coping strategies that
lead certain patients to cling to overly
optimistic views of their prognoses may
also lead those patients to opt for life-
extending therapy. Although our multi-
variable analysis suggests that the as-
sociation between self-perceived prog-
nosis and treatment preference is not
explained by sociodemographic, clinical,
or quality-of-life variables, this does not
prove causation.
The real value of this observational
study is not that it provides definitive
proof that improving cancer patients'
understanding of their prognoses would
enable them to make better decisions
about their treatment. Rather, it is im-
portant preliminary evidence that could
be used to justify an intervention study
to examine the issue. The potential costs
ofeffectivelyeducatingincurablecancer
patients about their prognoses might in-
clude the loss of hope and associated del-
eterious effect on quality of life. How-
ever,ourdatasuggestthattheremaybe
realbenefitsaswell,includingtreatment

tient preferences, which could lead to a
diminisheddemandforaggressive,toxic
interventions driven by unrealistic ex-
pectations. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that physicians may be able to
provide prognostic data that are suffi-
ciently accurate to achieve these ben-
efits.
The results of the phase 2 SUPPORT
intervention trial demonstrated that
providingprognosticinformationtophy-
sicians was not effective in changing the
patterns of care of the seriously ill.15 The
results of this analysis suggest that to
achieve the goals of making care at the
end of life consistent with patient values
and minimizing futile therapy, we may
need to change what physicians tell pa-
tients about their prognoses and be sure
that patients hear and understand what
their physicians have said. Meticulous
carewouldberequiredtodesignanethi-
cal and informative study of the impact
educatingcancerpatientsaboutprogno-
sis has on a variety of outcomes. The po-
tential benefit of such findings to pa-
tients, their families, and society could
be substantial.

Johnson Foundation and the American Society of

phylactic mastectomy should be performed (FIGURE). Re-
spondents' answers were not correlated with women's age
at the time of the survey, their disease status, or their ge-
netic risk. In contrast, the age at which surgery hypotheti-
cally would be scheduled was strongly associated with the
acceptability of prophylactic mastectomy. Only 4.7% (22)
of patients and 10.9% (76) of physicians found the surgical
intervention acceptable in women younger than age 35 years.
Comment. Although prophylactic mastectomy may pro-
long life in women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who
accept the intervention, if the intervention is unacceptable
to most women, particularly when suggested to women
younger than 35 years, the age at which the benefit is ex-
pected to be the highest, prophylactic mastectomy is un-
likely to have a substantial impact. The convergence of pa-
tientaversion,physicianreluctance,andcautiousinstitutional
guidelines4 will likely make prophylactic mastectomy a rarely
performed procedure in France, even if other populations
may find this strategy more acceptable.4-6

The acceptability of prophylactic mastectomy to women potentially at risk was
assessed prior to the first cancer genetic consultation. We plotted the rate at which
women and physicians said surgery would be acceptable according to age at which
the intervention is hypothetically scheduled. Effectiveness (Ef) of the strategy was
computed using the following formula: Ef = C (Dfw), where Dfw is the propor-
tion of cancer-prone women still disease free who accept prophylactic mastec-
tomy at a given age based on Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium penetrance data,3
and C is the efficacy of the intervention (90%) as given by Hartmann et al.2
