 The Decline of Electoral Participation in America

 Since 1960 turnout has declined in presidential elections, and since 1966 it has declined in off-year
 congressional elections. These declines occurred despite several major trends that could have in-
 creased electoral participation. An analysis of the eight SRC-CPS presidential election surveys con-
 ducted between 1952 and 1980 and of the six SRC-CPS congressional election surveys conducted be-
 tween 1958 and 1978 suggests that these declines may result largely from the combined impact of two
 attitudinal trends: the weakening of party identification and declining beliefs about government
 responsiveness, that is, lowered feelings of "external" political efficacy. Between two-thirds and
 seven-tenths of the decline in presidential turnout between 1960 and 1980 appears to result from the
 combined impact of these trends. Data limitations hinder our efforts to study the decline of congres-
 sional turnout, but approximately two-fifths to one-half of the decline between 1966 and 1978 appears
 to result from the combined impact of these attitudinal trends.

 The decline of electoral participation is among
 the most clearly documented trends in postwar
 American politics. Turnout was low in 1948, but it
 grew between 1948 and 1960, by which time 63
 percent of the adult population voted for pres-
 ident. Since then the percentage has consis-
 tently declined, reaching only 53 percent in 1980.1
 Turnout in off-year congressional elections
 follows a similar trend. Turnout was low in 1946
 but grew steadily through 1962, peaking at 45 per-
 cent in the 1962 and 1966 off-year elections. Since
 then, turnout has consistently declined, reaching

 'Except for 1980 all our reports on turnout are based
 upon U.S. Bureau of the Census (1980, p. 515). Our
 estimate of turnout for 1980 is based upon the total
 number of votes cast for president (86,496,851) reported
 by the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the
 U.S. Bureau of the Census count of the population aged
 18 and older as of April 1, 1980 (162,760,668). The lat-
 ter figure is unpublished but was provided to us by the
 Bureau. As the adult population grew between April 1
 and November 4, the final turnout figure may be lower
 than the 53.1 percent we estimate.

 only 35 percent in the 1978 congressional elec-
 tions.

 The dangers of electoral nonparticipation for
 American democracy have been pointed out by
 both journalists and scholars; in his "crisis of
 confidence" speech, President Carter lamented
 that "Two-thirds of our people do not even
 vote." The decline in turnout is paradoxical, for it
 has occurred despite several major trends that
 might well have increased electoral participation:
 the rise in educational levels of the electorate, the
 enactment of less restrictive registration pro-
 cedures, and the enfranchisement of southern
 blacks. Moreover, even though a substantial ma-
 jority of the electorate thought the 1968, 1976,
 and 1980 presidential contests would be close,
 turnout declined in all three of these elections.
 The enfranchisement of 18, 19, and 20 year olds
 did reduce turnout, but several scholars have
 demonstrated that their enfranchisement de-
 creased overall turnout by only one percentage
 point (cf. Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980, p. 58).
 Given all the factors that should have increased
 turnout, the decline in turnout may properly be
 labelled a puzzle (Brody 1978).

 This article suggests that the decline in electoral
 participation results largely from two basic attitu-
 dinal trends: the weakening of party loyalties
 among the American electorate and declining
 beliefs about government responsiveness, that is,
 lowered feelings of "external" political efficacy.2

 2Although the data suggest that these attitudinal

 changes contributed to the decline of electoral participa-
 tion, they cannot be used to establish causal relation-
 ships. Even though we have strong theoretical reasons

 Although the importance of these variables has
 been noticed before in the research literature, our
 analysis contributes to explaining the decline of
 turnout in four ways. First, we clarify some of the
 conceptual confusion which has characterized
 much of the extant research. Second, we demon-
 strate the importance of attitude change for the
 decline of both presidential and congressional
 turnout. Third, we clearly demonstrate the com-
 bined impact of these two attitude trends. Last,
 we employ two complementary methods to eval-
 uate the impact of these attitude trends, for we
 use both a simple algebraic correction procedure
 and probit estimates.

 Data and Measurement Problems

 We analyzed the eight presidential election
 surveys conducted by the Survey Research Center
 and the Center for Political Studies (SRC-CPS) of
 the University of Michigan between 1952 and
 1980, as well as the six off-year congressional
 surveys conducted between 1958 and 1978.
 Although the SRC-CPS surveys provide the best
 data for studying attitudinal change, like all
 surveys conducted in the United States they over-
 estimate turnout. Since the SRC data tend to
 overestimate turnout by about 15 percentage
 points, can they be used to study changing levels
 of electoral participation?

 In our view there are three reasons why the
 SRC-CPS data can be used to study the decline in
 turnout. First, in spite of their systematic over-
 reporting of turnout, the SRC data do closely
 parallel the real world trends observed from using
 electoral statistics and the Census estimates of the
 voting-age population. The SRC data, for exam-
 ple, show that turnout peaked in 1960 and record
 a decline of eight percentage points between that
 election and 1980.3 The correlation between the
 actual trend between 1952 and 1980 and the trend
 observed with the SRC data is 0.86; the correla-
 tion for the two trends between 1960 and 1980 is
 0.98. The SRC data record a decline of ten per-
 centage points in voting for congressional candi-
 dates between 1962 and 1978. The correlation be-
 tween the actual trend between 1958 and 1978 and
 the trend observed with the SRC data is 0.78; the

 to suggest that these attitudes contribute to the indi-
 vidual-level propensity to vote, the decline in turnout
 may also have contributed to attitudinal change.

 3For the sake of comparability with the aggregate

 data, in this paragraph we report the SRC trends for the
 total electorate. However, as we shall see, the decline of
 turnout among the white electorate is somewhat greater,

 correlation between the two trends between 1962
 and 1978 is 0.79.

 Second, we can use the SRC data because,
 although they always overestimate voting, we
 have some evidence that such overestimates are
 not substantially different for the various attitude
 groups we will be studying. In 1964, 1976, 1978,
 and 1980 the SRC-CPS supplemented its election
 survey by a check of official voting records to
 determine if respondents actually voted.4 Our
 analysis shows that in all three presidential surveys
 there were only negligible differences in voting
 overreports among whites with different levels of
 partisan strength or differing levels of "external"
 political efficacy. In 1978 there were also few dif-
 ferences in overreporting, although pure indepen-
 dents were more likely to report voting falsely
 than any other partisan group.

 Third, we can rely upon the SRC data because
 they allow us to analyze the decline of turnout be-
 tween 1964, 1976, and 1980 with the validated
 results that utilize voting records. These data, too,
 overestimate turnout, showing a 71.1 percent
 turnout rate in 1964, 60.9 percent in 1976, and
 56.6 percent in 1980 (whereas actual turnout was
 61.9 percent, 54.3 percent, and 53.1 percent in
 these elections), and record a substantially greater
 decline than the actual voting statistics. Still, they
 provide a valuable data set to supplement our
 analyses.

 Despite these reasons, certain limitations must
 be considered in using the SRC data. Although
 the SRC data undoubtedly provide a good cross-
 section of voters, these surveys interview propor-
 tionately fewer nonvoters (even when the voter
 validation studies are used to identify nonpartici-
 pants). There may be some biases in the set of
 interviewed nonvoters compared to the entire
 population of nonvoters. We also recognize that a
 comprehensive study of the decline of turnout
 must use a wide variety of survey data, including
 the U.S. Bureau of the Census surveys and
 possibly Gallup, Harris, and National Opinion
 Research Center surveys. A comprehensive study
 should also employ aggregate voting statistics.
 However, whatever their limitations, the SRC
 data provide the best source to study the attitu-
 dinal correlates of the decline of turnout, for they

 tudinal correlates of overreports of voting using the
 1976 and 1978 voter validation studies, see Traugott and
 Katosh (1979) and Katosh and Traugott (1981). The ma-
 jor bias revealed by their analysis is the tendency of
 blacks to be more likely to overreport voting than whites
 (a result that also obtains with the 1964 and 1980 sur-
 veys). This bias need not concern us here, since our
 analyses are restricted to whites.

 provide consistent measures of political attitudes
 over the period when turnout declined.

 Logic of Research Strategy

 In this article we focus on two political attitudes
 to account for the decline of turnout.' An alterna-
 tive approach is to use a multivariate analysis that
 includes a large number of variables, but this ap-
 proach is usually unsuccessful in accounting for
 the decline of turnout because such studies have
 often given little thought to the ways variables
 relate to each other, how they should best be mea-
 sured, and why they might be expected to con-
 tribute to turnout. Even so, a multivariate ap-
 proach would be necessary if our goal were to ex-
 plain all variation in turnout, but our goal is to ex-
 plain why turnout declined. Thus it is not neces-
 sary to consider directly changes such as increas-
 ing levels of education that can only have acted to
 retard the decline of electoral participation.

 Despite the lack of success of most previous
 analyses in accounting for the decline of turnout,
 previous studies have often proved valuable by
 identifying variables that are not related to turn-
 out. We are guided by two fundamental facts.
 First, political attitudes that have not changed in
 the aggregate cannot account for the change in the
 behavior of the electorate. Second, attitudes that
 are not related to turnout cannot account for its
 decline.

 This first fact leads us to reject several candi-
 date variables from consideration. For example,
 although feelings of citizen duty are consistently
 and strongly related to turnout, there has been no
 decline in such feelings (Miller, Miller, and
 Schneider 1980, p. 288). Likewise, beliefs about
 personal political effectiveness, that is, feelings of
 "internal" political efficacy are strongly related
 to turnout. However, feelings of personal political
 effectiveness have not declined, and this dimen-
 sion of efficacy cannot account for the decline of
 participation (Miller 1980).6 Likewise, although

 5This article focuses on the attitudinal correlates of
 turnout. For useful discussions of the social and demo-
 graphic correlates of turnout during the postwar years
 that uses SRC-CPS data, see Boyd (1981), Hout and
 Knoke (1975), and Reiter (1979). For a useful discussion
 using the U.S. Bureau of the Census Surveys, see
 Cavanagh (1981).

 'Feelings of "internal" political efficacy have not
 changed, since one of the two items used to measure
 these feelings, "voting is the only way," has registered a
 substantial increase in efficacious responses since 1966.
 Although the second item used to measure "internal"
 political efficacy, "politics seem complicated," regis-
 tered a decline, the changing responses to these two

 persons who are interested in politics are more
 likely to vote, interest in politics has not waned
 during the past two decades (Miller, Miller, and
 Schneider 1980, p. 307).

 Political trust, on the other hand, has declined

 markedly (Abramson and Finifter 1981; Miller,
 Miller, and Schneider 1980, p. 268). However,
 feelings of political trust are only weakly related
 to electoral participation (Citrin 1981, 1974), and
 the decline in trust cannot directly account for the
 decline of turnout.7

 On the other hand, concern about which party
 will win the election has declined steadily since
 1964, and concern is related to turnout. Ferejohn
 and Fiorina (1979) argue that the decline in turn-
 out can largely be explained by declining concern
 over electoral outcomes. They argue that the
 decline in turnout does not constitute a "puzzle,"
 since "recent fluctuations in turnout in Presiden-
 tial elections appear to arise from variations in
 election specific factors" (p. 30). In our view,
 however, the declining concern with electoral out-
 comes probably results largely from the erosion of
 party loyalties, for there is a very strong relation-
 ship between strength of party identification and
 concern about which party will win. Therefore,
 we shall turn to the erosion of partisanship to
 begin our analysis and return to this "concern"
 variable later.

 Decline of Party Identification

 and Decline of Turnout

 The party identification of white Americans
 was fairly stable between 1952 and 1964. In 1964,

 items have led to virtually no change in overall levels of
 "internal" political efficacy.

 There is a debate over the best way to measure sense

 of political efficacy, although many scholars now argue
 that the "voting is the only way" item should not be in-
 cluded in an overall sense of political efficacy measure
 (Balch 1974; Converse 1972). Balch has presented con-
 vincing evidence that the four standard items used to
 measure feelings of political efficacy may best be viewed
 as tapping two separate dimensions. The two items men-
 tioned above appear to tap beliefs about personal politi-
 cal effectiveness, or "internal" political efficacy,
 whereas the remaining two items (reported in full in
 note 18) measure beliefs about government respon-
 siveness or "external" political efficacy. Factor
 analyses we have conducted with Finifter suggest that
 Balch's interpretation is sound. Analyses by Craig
 (1979) also strongly support this view.

 'Following the scoring procedures used by Abramson
 and Finifter (1981), we found that in 1980 only 24 per-
 cent of the electorate scored medium or high on the
 standard five-item political trust index. Our analyses of
 both this index and of the five items individually showed

 36 percent of the white electorate were strong
 party identifiers, a figure that dropped to 27 per-
 cent in 1966. Since 1966 the decline has been more
 gradual. In 1978 only 21 percent of the whites
 interviewed were strong partisans, whereas 23 per-
 cent were in 1980. In all the SRC surveys between
 1952 and 1964 the proportion of independents
 with no party leanings never rose about 9 percent.
 This figure increased to 12 percent in 1966 and to
 14 percent in both 1978 and 1980. As is well
 known, however, the party loyalties of black
 Americans grew dramatically between 1960 and
 1964. With a single exception, party identification
 among blacks has always been stronger from 1964
 on than it was in surveys conducted before 1964.
 Given the markedly different trend between
 blacks and whites in one of our two independent
 variables, it is important to analyze whites and
 blacks separately. The results presented in this ar-
 ticle are limited to whites.8

 There are strong theoretical reasons to expect
 partisan loyalties to contribute to electoral par-
 ticipation. As Campbell and his colleagues (1960)
 argued, strong feelings of partisan identifica-
 tion contribute to psychological involvement in
 politics. From a rational-choice perspective,
 which may view party identification as a weighted
 average of past evaluations of the parties (Fiorina
 1981), we would also expect partisanship to con-
 tribute to electoral participation, since partisan
 loyalties reduce information costs and thereby
 reduce the costs of voting. Further, strong par-
 tisans are more likely to have stronger preferences
 among the candidates, and thus evaluate a greater
 differential benefit from the election of their pre-
 ferred candidate. However, regardless of our
 theoretical perspective, we have many empirical
 studies that document a relationship between par-
 tisan loyalties and electoral participation.

 Given that strong partisans are more likely to
 vote than either weak partisans or independents
 who lean toward a party, and that independents
 who do not lean toward a party are the least likely

 that feelings of political trust were not related to turnout
 in the 1980 presidential election.

 'In addition to manifesting a different trend in their
 partisan loyalties, blacks also manifest a different trend
 in turnout, since participation increased markedly
 among southern blacks. However, this increase can
 scarcely be explained in attitudinal terms, since it results
 from such forces as the civil rights movement and the
 Voting Rights Act of 1965 which enabled southern
 blacks to register and to vote. An analysis of changing
 turnout among blacks, therefore, would need to rely on
 a different theoretical perspective from the one we use
 to study change among whites.

 to vote, the overall weakening of party identifica-
 tion among the white electorate may partly con-
 tribute to the decline in electoral participation. In-
 deed, several studies have already explored this
 possibility, although there is wide disagreement
 about the impact of the decline of partisanship
 upon the decline of turnout.

 Using a multivariate analysis that examines only
 the 1960 and 1972 SRC-CPS surveys. Ashenfelter
 and Kelley (1981, p. 717) conclude that "the
 strength of 'partisanship' of the respondent had
 little or nothing to do with the probability of
 voting." However, their conclusion that "the
 single most important factor accounting for the
 decline in turnout . . . is the dramatic shift in
 voter expectations about the closeness of the race
 in these two elections" (p. 721) cannot possibly
 account for the monotonic decline of turnout
 since 1960. At the other extreme, DeNardo (1980)
 argues that partisans constitute the core of the ac-
 tive electorate, and that "The withering of the
 core is thus sufficient to explain the predominant
 trends in recent elections" (p. 417). However, this
 conclusion was reached without actually analyz-
 ing individual-level data that relate partisanship to
 political participation.

 Most scholars have reached conclusions that
 fall between these extremes. For example, Hill
 and Luttbeg (1980) examine turnout levels among
 different partisan strength categories for the en-
 tire electorate with the use of all the SRC-CPS
 presidential election surveys from 1952 through
 1976. They conclude that "increasing indepen-
 dence from political parties has contributed to
 declining participation" (p. 106), but do not ac-
 tually estimate its impact. And Cassel and Hill
 (1981) in a multivariate analysis of non-
 southerners in the 1964 and 1976 SRC-CPS voter
 validation studies, conclude that the erosion of
 partisan loyalties contributed to a decline in turn-
 out of only one percentage point. A multivariate
 analysis by Reiter (1979) presents the relationship
 of partisan strength to turnout among whites in all
 the SRC-CPS presidential election studies from
 1960 through 1976, but it is difficult to interpret
 his results to estimate the impact of declining par-
 tisan loyalties. Miller (1980) concludes that the
 decline in partisanship has contributed to the ero-
 sion of turnout, but he does not directly estimate
 the decline's impact. And Conway (1981) con-
 ducts a multivariate analysis of turnout among the
 entire electorate using the 1970 and 1974 SRC-
 CPS surveys as well as the 1978 CPS voter valida-
 tion study. She briefly considers the possibility
 that the erosion of party loyalties contributed to
 the decline in congressional turnout by leading to
 a decline in political involvement and concludes it
 did not. However, Conway does not provide a
 longitudinal test of the direct effects of the ero-

 sion of partisanship upon turnout during this
 period.

 In our view, the best estimates have been pre-
 sented by Shaffer (1981), who presents a multi-
 variate analysis of SRC-CPS data on turnout
 among non-southerners in the presidential elec-
 tions from 1960 through 1976. His conclusion that
 approximately one-fourth of the decline in presi-
 dential turnout results from the decline of parti-
 sanship seems sound, and his algebraic estimation
 procedures are similar to those we use. However,
 although his discriminant analyses are sound, they
 do not present clearly the changing impact of the
 decline of partisanship upon turnout from elec-
 tion to election. Moreover, since trends in both
 partisan loyalties and turnout are substantially
 different among whites and among blacks, it is
 preferable to examine whites and blacks separate-
 ly.' Last, Shaffer did not examine the impact of

 'We have no objection to analyses that examine the
 South and the rest of the nation separately, although
 Shaffer's analysis suggests that the pattern of relation-
 ships outside the South is very similar to that for the na-
 tion as a whole. However, it is far more important to
 examine whites and blacks separately, since the party
 identification trend for blacks runs directly counter to
 that for whites. White southerners and whites outside
 the South have both experienced declining feelings of
 party identification and eroding feelings of "external"
 political efficacy. Moreover, the U.S. Bureau of the
 Census surveys show that between 1964 and 1980 turn-
 out has actually been declining somewhat among white
 southerners, although the decline is greater outside the
 South. (See U.S. Bureau of the Census 1981.)

 declining partisanship upon turnout in congres-
 sional elections, even though, as we shall see, the
 decline of partisanship has affected congressional
 turnout more than presidential turnout.

 Like all but one of the studies cited above, our
 own analysis of the impact of the decline of par-
 tisanship relies upon the SRC-CPS surveys. Table
 1 shows the percentage of whites who said they
 voted for president for all the elections between
 1952 and 1980 and examines participation levels
 within each partisan strength category. By reading
 down each column we can examine turnout
 among each partisan group. It is clear that there
 has been little change in turnout among strong
 partisans, whereas all remaining groups register a
 decline.

 Two facts should become apparent if we exam-
 ine the data presented in Table 1. First, there
 would have been some decline in turnout after
 1960 even without a decline in any of the four col-
 umns, simply because the distribution of respon-
 dents in the partisan-strength categories had
 shifted. Second, there would have been a substan-
 tial erosion in turnout even if partisanship had not
 declined, because no partisan group increased its
 participation and because three groups registered
 a decline.

 We can estimate what turnout would have been

 from 1960 on if no decline in partisan strength
 had occurred."' Using the distribution of partisans

 'Most of the substantive concern with the decline of

 turnout has focused on the erosion of participation
 since 1960, which is our primary reason for using the

 tiveness, we will not examine the effects of con-
 gressional turnout in detail. However this decline
 also resulted partly from the erosion of partisan
 loyalties. According to our algebraic estimates,
 about one-third of the decline in congressional
 turnout between 1962 and 1978 resulted from the
 erosion of partisanship. If, as will be necessary for
 our comparisons with political efficacy, we begin
 the analysis with 1966, approximately one-fifth of
 the decline can be accounted for by the decline in
 partisan loyalties.

 in 1960 as our base, we will assume that levels of
 turnout for each subgroup would have been the
 same even if no erosion in partisanship had oc-
 curred. As partisan strength did not decline be-
 tween 1960 and 1964, the estimates using this
 algebraic correction technique have little effect on
 the results. However, after 1964 the percentage
 that would have voted if partisan strength is
 assumed to remain constant is consistently higher
 than the percentage that actually reported voting.
 The algebraic correction procedure predicts 79.4
 percent turnout in 1968, 74.6 percent in 1972, 75.9
 percent in 1976, and 75.6 percent turnout in 1980.
 According to the SRC-CPS data, there was a
 decline of 10.2 percentage points in presidential
 voting between 1960 and 1980; if there had been
 no decline in party loyalties, then everything else
 being equal, the decline would have been 7.7 per-
 centage points. Roughly three-fourths of the
 decline in turnout would have occurred without
 any erosion in partisan loyalties. Viewed from
 another perspective, however, about one-fourth
 of the decline in turnout can be attributed to the
 erosion of partisan loyalties."1

 Up to this point, our analyses have focused on
 the declining levels of turnout from 1960 through
 1980 by imagining what turnout would have been
 without any decline in the aggregate strength of
 partisan affiliation in the electorate. This
 algebraic technique provides an assessment of the
 impact of declining partisanship but does not ad-
 dress squarely differences in the relationship be-
 tween partisanship and turnout from election to
 election. To address this question we combined
 the data reported in Table 1 into a single, large,
 pooled, cross-sectional, time-series data set.

 Our major concern is to estimate the effect of
 declining feelings of partisan affiliation on turn-
 out. This basic argument can be tested in equation
 (1):

 Similar results obtain when we turn to the vali-

 dated voting records for the 1964 and 1976 sur-
 veys, although given the sharp decline of "vali-
 dated" turnout in 1980, the impact of partisan-
 ship is reduced when we compare 1964 and 1980.
 According to our algebraic estimates, about a
 fourth of the decline of turnout between 1964 and
 1976 results from the weakening of party identifi-
 cation, but only a seventh of the decline can be ac-
 counted for if we compare 1964 and 1980.

 Because data limitations restrict our ability to
 examine the effects of feelings of political effec-

 Kennedy-Nixon contest as our baseline. It would be pos-
 sible to begin our analyses with 1952 or 1956, since the
 key attitudes we study were measured in both those
 years. For a discussion of technical reasons for which
 we do not begin with these surveys, see Abramson and
 Aldrich (1981, note 12).

 "Because part of the decline of turnout between 1960
 and 1980 results from the enfranchisement of 18, 19,
 and 20 year olds, and since these youths have very weak
 partisan loyalties as well as low turnout, we conducted
 an analysis in which 18, 19, and 20 year olds outside of
 Georgia and Kentucky were excluded from our calcula-
 tions. (Alaska allowed 19 and 20 year olds to vote, and
 Hawaii enfranchised 20 year olds, but the SRC does not
 interview in those states.) Obviously, excluding 18, 19,
 and 20 year olds raised aggregate turnout slightly, but
 their exclusion had virtually no effect on our estimates
 of the impact of declining party loyalties. These youths
 actually had slightly higher feelings of "external" politi-
 cal efficacy than their elders, and their exclusion slightly
 increased the impact of declining feelings of efficacy on
 the decline of turnout.

 Here, Pit refers to the ith individual's reported
 strength of partisan affiliation in election year t
 (t= 1960, . . ., 1980).12 Yit is one if individual i
 voted in year t and 0 if he or she abstained, where-
 as Pr denotes a probability of turnout to be esti-
 mated. The equation, then, states that the proba-
 bility of voting is a transformation of a linear
 function of strength of partisanship. Changes in
 proportionate turnout are attributable to varia-
 tions in Pi in any given year or to changes in the
 distribution of Pi over the various election years,
 t. We will estimate it, f, and Pr(Y) via probit (us-
 ing the McKelvey-Zavoina program (1975); see
 also Aldrich and Cnudde (1975)). Therefore, the
 transformation function, f, is assumed to be the
 cumulative normal distribution function (com-

 12We collapsed the strength of partisan identification
 scale to three points, combining weak partisans with in-
 dependents who lean toward a party. Thus, Pit equals 0
 for independents with no partisan leanings, 1 for weak
 partisans and independent leaners, and 2 for strong par-
 tisans. As can be seen in Table 1, turnout among inde-
 pendent leaners tends to be quite comparable to turnout
 among weak partisans. We also ran all estimations with
 the four-point party identification scale. Although these
 estimates are somewhat attenuated, the differences are
 very small and not significantly different from those
 reported here.

 monly denoted 4A, so f = 4) in equation 1). We are
 assuming that strength of partisanship is an inter-
 val scale.13 More important, equation (1) assumes
 that the same parameters describe the relationship
 between strength of partisanship and turnout for
 all election years.

 something more to the decline of turnout than
 just changes in strength of partisanship. The theo-
 retical problem is more severe if equation (3) is
 significantly superior to equation (2), for that im-
 plies that whatever is left out is confounding the
 relationship between Pit and turnout."4

 It is possible, of course, that factors will inter-

 The estimates of equations (1-3) are reported in

 vene which will either stimulate or depress turnout
 uniformly in any one year for all categories of Pi.
 For example, the one-sided election of 1964 (or
 1972) might have depressed turnout regardless of
 the strength of one's attachment to a party; that
 is, such factors may intrude without changing the
 relationship between strength of partisanship and
 abstention. If we let Tit be one, if i is in the sample
 in the tth election year, zero otherwise, this
 hypothesis can be written as:

 Pr(Yit= 1) = a(ny6 + At Tit + 3P1,) (2)

 The difference between equation (2) and equation
 (1) is only in the constant term; that is, equation
 (1) is a special case of equation (2), where A=60
 and At = 0 for t = 1964, . . . , 1980.

 Equation (3) is an even more general equation:

 Pr(Yit=l) = ('460 + AtTit + 0Pit

 + at TitPid (3)

 The addition of the "interaction terms" and
 parameters ft in equation (3) allows for a changed
 relationship between strength of partisanship and
 turnout in each election year. If there is no change
 in the relationship in any given year compared to
 1960, ft = 0. If that is true for all elections after
 1960, equation (3) reduces to equation (2). By
 definition, then, equation (3) must fit the data no
 worse (and ordinarily better) than equation (2),
 whereas equation (2) can fit no worse than equa-
 tion (1).

 Table 2. The fit of all equations is very high (bas-
 ed on the chi-square, -2 x LLR, statistic), but the
 probit-analog to R2 is rather low (for equation (1),
 roughly equivalent to a simple "correlation" of
 0.25), obviously suggesting a moderate relation-
 ship."5 In each equation, the relationship between
 Pit and turnout is strong, positive, and significant
 and remains so in each election year in equation
 (3). For example, equation (1) predicts a pure in-
 dependent to vote with a probability of 0.60, a
 weak partisan or leaner with probability 0.75, and
 a strong partisan with probability 0.86. The cor-
 relation between predicted proportionate turnout
 and the actual rate of turnout for each partisan
 category in each election year is very high in all
 these equations, e.g. it is 0.96 for equation (1).
 These correlations are denoted r(actual/predicted) in
 Table 2.

 Equation (1) is the most direct test of the
 hypothesis, and Figure 1 graphically presents
 these results. The solid line shows reported turn-
 out for each election year, while the broken line
 presents turnout as predicted by equation (1).
 Clearly, equation (1) predicts much less change in
 turnout than actually occurred. Although re-
 ported turnout declines 10.2 percentage points be-
 tween 1960 and 1980, equation (1) predicts a drop
 in turnout owing to a decline in the strength of
 partisan affiliation of only 2.3 percentage points.
 Yet approximately 30 percent of the drop in
 voting can be attributed to the decline of Pit."'

 The hypothesis that equation (2) is not a signifi-

 cant improvement over equation (1) can be re-
 jected easily, whereas equation (3) is only some-

 "4It is possible, of course, that other, excluded varia-
 bles confound the relationship if equation (2) or even if
 equation (1) is satisfactory. The inference in that case
 would be that the confounding is constant over time.

 "Since the estimates reported here (and in Table 4)
 predict that citizens in all categories of the independent
 variable in each election year have a higher probability
 of voting than abstaining, all are predicted to vote.
 Thus, such measures as the percentage of cases pre-
 dicted correctly are irrelevant.

 "6One measure of this is the regression of turnout in

 each election year on that predicted by the estimate of
 equation (1). This regression has a slope of 3.43, with a
 reciprocal of 0.29, meaning that it takes about ten units
 of predicted decline to yield three units of actual
 decline. This figure is essentially the same as that de-
 rived from the algebraic technique used previously.

 Although the equations are nested in terms of
 generality, the increasing generality raises theo-
 retical questions. If equation (2) is a significant
 improvement over equation (1), then there is

 13We recognize that there is considerable controversy
 over the proper classification of independent leaners,
 and over the dimensionality of the party identification
 scale itself (Weisberg 1980; Shively 1980). However, this
 controversy is largely orthogonal to our treatment of
 party identification in this analysis. The debate over the
 classification of leaners does not bear on our analysis,
 since similar results obtain regardless of how we classify
 them. The debate over the dimensionality of party iden-
 tification does not directly concern us, since for the pur-
 poses of this analysis party identification is close to in-
 terval as it relates to turnout, at least when weak par-
 tisans and independents who lean toward a party are
 combined.

 what less clearly a significant improvement over
 equation (2).17 The problem is seen quite clearly in
 either equation estimates. Tt is significant and
 negative in each election year. In 1964 and in 1968
 there was a drop in participation for all levels of
 Pit (of about the same magnitude each year),
 whereas there was a second substantial drop in
 1972, 1976, and 1980. For equation (3), we can see
 in addition that there was a positive interaction ef-
 fect in all election years after 1960, but it was a
 significant improvement only in the last three elec-
 tions. In sum, the 1960 election was atypical in
 having a higher participation rate for all Pi's, but
 with a weaker relationship between Pi and turn-
 out. The last three elections, for example, evi-
 denced a much stronger relationship between
 strength of partisanship and turnout compared to

 "7The test is developed in Aldrich (1977) and is
 analogous to the Chow test in regression (Chow 1960).
 Basically, the test is of the difference in the log likeli-
 hood functions of the more and less constrained equa-
 tions. The comparison of equation (2) to (1) yields a x2
 of 55.9 (a > 0.999), equation (3) compared to equation
 (2) yields a X2 of 12.1 (0.975 > a > 0.95) and equa-

 1960, but for pure independents, starting at a
 much lower level of participation.

 We estimated the comparable probit equations
 for the 1964, 1976, and 1980 elections using
 reported and validated turnout as the dependent
 variables. The results are similar to those reported
 previously. Although the slope coefficients are
 somewhat smaller (especially for 1980) in the
 validated vote estimates, they are not significantly
 different from those using reported voting. Thus,
 the use of self-reported turnout does not affect
 our results significantly.

 We also estimated equations (1-3) for off-year
 congressional turnout for the 1962 through 1978
 election years. The coefficient estimate for parti-
 sanship in equation (1) is almost identical to that
 for the presidential turnout estimates (0.404 ver-
 sus 0.424, respectively). However, the decline in
 turnout for congressional elections is much more
 closely related to partisanship. Equation (1) esti-
 mates predict seven-tenths of the actual decline in
 turnout between 1962 and 1978. If we begin the
 analysis with 1966, then partisanship is estimated
 to account for just over one-fourth of the decline.
 In sum, the strength of partisan affiliation is

 strongly and positively related to turnout in each
 election, and this relationship has grown over

 statements: "I don't think public officials care much
 what people like me think," and "People like me don't
 have any say about what the government does." (See

 into a single measure.) Respondents who disagreed with
 both items were scored as highly efficacious; those who
 disagreed with one but agreed with the other were
 scored as medium; those who agreed with both were
 scored as low. Respondents with ambiguous responses
 to one of these questions were scored as either high or
 low according to their response on the remaining item,

 time. As a result, the erosion of partisanship in
 the electorate can explain between 25 and 30 per-
 cent of the decline in participation in presidential
 elections and even more of the decline in off-year
 congressional elections. Still, there is a good deal
 more to the decline of turnout than the decline of
 partisanship. We turn now to consider a second
 attitudinal trend to help solve the puzzle of declin-
 ing turnout-the erosion of "external" political
 efficacy.

 Decline in Beliefs about Government
 Responsiveness and Decline of Turnout

 The decline in feelings of political effectiveness

 has been widely documented (Abramson 1977;
 Wright 1976), but the extent of that decline
 becomes clearer if we focus on beliefs about gov-
 ernment responsiveness, or what Balch (1974) and
 others have called feelings of "external" political
 efficacy. To study such feelings over the period of

 ate time period."' When we turn to our index we
 find that feelings of "external" political efficacy
 were highest in 1956 and 1960, when 64 percent of
 the whites scored high on our measure. By 1964
 the percentage scoring high dropped to 56 per-
 cent, and this percentage has declined consistently
 through 1978. By 1978 only 38 percent scored high
 on the "external" political efficacy measure,
 while 39 percent did in 1980. Likewise, the per-
 centage scoring low on this measure was only 15
 percent in 1956 and 1960 but has risen fairly
 steadily since. By 1978 34 percent of the white
 electorate scored low on this measure, and in 1980
 30 percent scored low.

 We have strong theoretical reasons to expect
 that persons who feel politically effective will be
 more likely to vote. Persons who feel politically
 capable may feel psychologically motivated to
 participate, whereas those who feel overwhelmed
 by the political process may withdraw from
 political activity. Moreover, feelings of political
 effectiveness are also related to support for
 democratic political norms that value citizen par-
 ticipation. From a rational-choice perspective,
 one would expect that beliefs that the government
 is responsive would increase the subjective utility
 of voting. The expected benefits of voting will be
 higher if one believes that officials are unrespon-
 sive. Regardless of our theoretical perspective, we
 have numerous empirical studies that document a
 relationship between high feelings of political ef-
 fectiveness and political participation. Some of
 these studies have examined the impact of chang-
 ing levels of political efficacy upon the decline of
 turnout. However the conceptual confusion that
 now surrounds the measurement of this concept
 has led to contradictory conclusions about the ef-
 fects of efficacy.

 Ashenfelter and Kelley (1975), who include one
 "internal" efficiacy item in their measure
 ("politics seem complicated"), conclude that feel-
 ings of efficacy have little effect upon turnout.
 Hill and Luttbeg (1980) combine the two "exter-
 nal" efficacy items into a measure of "aliena-
 tion," but they fail to estimate the impact of in-
 creasing "alienation" upon turnout. And in his
 article with Cassell, Hill used the standard four-
 item index of political efficacy which has now
 been abandoned by the Michigan researchers
 themselves. Cassel and Hill (1981) conclude that
 the decline of efficacy has had little impact on the
 decline of turnout. However by including the

 "9New items to measure feelings of "external" politi-

 cal efficacy were introduced in 1968. These new items
 can be used to form useful measures, but they are not
 included in this analysis because of the need to maintain
 comparability over time.

 "voting is the only way" item in their measure,
 they seriously weaken their ability to study trends
 (see Converse 1972). Reiter's (1979) analysis is dif-
 ficult to interpret since he does not report the
 items he used to construct his measure of political
 efficacy. Miller, on the other hand, reaches clear
 conclusions when he reports (1980, p. 24) that
 "The explanation for declining turnout is not to
 be found in commensurate declines in political in-
 terest or involvement, or in decreasing sense of
 civic duty, feelings of political efficacy, or trust in
 government." These conclusions about efficacy
 actually refer only to "internal" political efficacy,
 although even here Miller's conclusions are con-
 founded since he includes the "don't have any
 say" item in his measure of "internal" effec-
 tiveness.

 Once again, Shaffer (1981) has presented the
 most solid analysis. He correctly chooses the two
 basic "external" efficacy items to construct his in-
 dex, although he selects them on grounds of
 reliability rather than validity and does not label
 his measure as "external" efficacy. Although he
 tends to exaggerate his estimate of the impact of
 the decline of efficacy (see Abramson and Aldrich
 1981, note 25), his fundamental conclusions are
 sound. And although Shaffer's discriminant
 analyses do not clearly present the changing im-
 pact of the decline of efficacy on the decline of
 turnout from election to election, these analysis
 also are basically sound. Including blacks with
 whites is not a serious problem when examining
 the impact of "external" political efficacy, since
 the trends for both races are similar from 1960 on-
 ward. However given the differing racial trends in
 participation, it is still preferable to examine
 whites and black separately.

 Despite the considerable confusion in the
 research literature, our own expectations are clear
 enough. Given that persons who feel politically ef-
 ficacious are more likely to vote than those who
 feel inefficacious, the overall weakening of feel-
 ings of "external" efficacy among the electorate
 may contribute to the decline of electoral par-
 ticipation. The data in Table 3 allow us to ex-
 amine the relationship of feelings of "external"
 political efficacy to participation in all eight
 presidential elections between 1952 and 1980.20 By

 "In examining these trends over time, we do not pre-
 sent change among each efficacy level with controls for
 level of education. Cassel (1981), in a discussion of an
 earlier version of this article (Abramson and Aldrich
 1981), argues that by not including level of education in
 our analysis we have not specified our model ade-
 quately. We disagree. Including education would be
 necessary if our goal were to explain all variation in
 turnout during the postwar years, but our goal is to ac-
 count for the decline of turnout. During the postwar

 reading down each column of Table 3 we can ex-
 amine change in turnout among each political ef-
 ficacy group. Among whites with high levels of
 "external" political efficacy, turnout was highest
 in 1960 and has declined since. Among whites
 with medium levels, turnout was fairly high in
 1960 and was somewhat lower in 1972, 1976, and
 1980. On the other hand, there has been little con-
 sistent change among respondents with low feel-
 ings of political efficacy, and turnout was only
 marginally lower in the three most recent elections
 than it was in 1960.

 We can estimate what turnout would have been
 from 1960 on if no decline in feelings of "exter-
 nal" efficacy had occurred by using the distribu-
 tion of respondents in each efficacy category as
 our base, and by assuming that levels of turnout
 for each subgroup would have been the same even
 if no erosion in feelings of "external" efficacyhad
 occurred. According to our estimates, if "exter-

 nal" efficacy had not declined, turnout would
 have been 80.5 percent in 1964, 81.0 percent in
 1968, 76.4 percent in 1972, 78.2 percent in 1976,
 and 77.7 percent in 1980. In every survey from
 1964 on, estimated turnout with no change in feel-
 ings of political effectiveness is higher than the
 reported turnout (see the last column of Table 3).
 According to the SRC-CPS data there was a
 decline of 10.3 percentage points in reported turn-
 out between 1960 and 1980. If there had been no
 decline in feelings of "external" political efficacy,
 then everything else being equal, the decline
 would have been only 4.7 percentage points. In
 other words, less than one-half of the decline in
 turnout would have occurred without any change
 in beliefs about government responsiveness. At
 the same time, somewhat more than one-half of
 the decline in turnout can be attributed to the ero-
 sion in feelings of "external" political efficacy.

 Unfortunately, we are somewhat thwarted in

 years educational levels have risen. Throughout the
 postwar years whites with higher levels of education
 have scored higher on "external" political efficacy.
 However, since 1960 feelings of "external" efficacy
 have declined among whites at all levels of education,
 and efficacy has declined despite rising levels of educa-
 tion. Likewise, throughout the postwar years, whites
 with higher levels of education have been more likely to
 vote. However, since 1960 turnout has declined among
 all educational subgroups (except college graduates),
 and turnout has thus declined despite rising educational
 levels. The main effect of rising educational levels has
 been to slow down both the decline of "external" ef-
 ficacy and the decline of turnout.

 our efforts to estimate the effects of the erosion of
 feelings of political efficacy upon the decline of
 "validated" turnout, as the first voter validation
 study was conducted only in 1964 after the decline
 in feelings of "external" political efficacy was
 already under way. Still, the validated results also
 suggest that the erosion of these feelings con-
 tributed to the decline of turnout. According to
 our algebraic estimates, about one-third of the
 decline of turnout between 1964 and 1976 resulted
 from the erosion of feelings of political efficacy,
 although if one only examines the decline between
 1964 and 1980, eroding feelings of efficacy ac-
 count for only one-fifth of the decline.

 We are also hindered in our efforts to estimate
 the effects of the erosion in feelings of political ef-

 fectiveness upon the decline of congressional
 voting because the first survey that allows us to
 examine the relationship between these feelings
 and off-year voting was conducted only in 1966.
 Nonetheless, our algebraic estimates suggest that
 about one-fifth of the decline in off-year turnout
 between 1966 and 1978 resulted from declining
 beliefs about government responsiveness.

 that an individual with low feelings of "external"
 efficacy will vote with a probability of approxi-
 mately 0.60. This probability rises to 0.75 for
 those in the middle category and to 0.85 for those
 highest in feelings of efficacy. The correlations
 between actual and predicted turnout rates in the
 eighteen efficacy/year categories are very high for
 each equation.

 Given the limitations of our algebraic estimates,

 we again turn to probit analysis to specify these
 relationships better. We substituted "external"
 efficacy for strength of partisanship into equa-
 tions (1-3), with efficacy coded 2 = high,
 I = medium, 0 = low, and estimated the three
 equations via probit. These estimates are reported
 in Table 4 for presidential turnout over the period
 from 1960 through 1980.

 As expected, the relationship between efficacy
 and turnout is somewhat stronger than that be-
 tween strength of partisanship and turnout. All
 goodness-of-fit-type measures are somewhat
 stronger, and of course efficacy is strongly and
 positively related to turnout in each set of
 estimates. The estimates of equation (1) predict

 Figure 2 presents the results of the equation (1)
 test. Again, the solid line shows reported turnout,
 and the broken line shows the equation (1) predic-
 tions. As compared to strength of partisanship,
 the estimates of equation (1) are much more close-
 ly aligned with the actual decline in voting. Equa-
 tion (1) predicts a turnout rate of 80.2 percent in
 1960 and 75.1 percent in 1980, for an overall
 predicted decline of 5.1 percent. As with our
 algebraic estimates, the estimates of equation (1)

 decline in turnout from 1960 to 1968 very closely
 but underpredict the extent of the decline from
 1968 to 1972 (and thus 1976 and 1980).

 The estimates of equation (3) fit significantly
 better than those of equation (2) which, in turn,
 fit significantly better than those of equation (1)22
 These equation-by-equation differences are not as
 substantial as with partisanship, however. The
 relationship of efficacy to turnout was highest in
 1960, fell sharply in 1964, rose close to its 1960

 level in 1968, then declined again. The pattern for
 partisanship, we should recall, was substantially
 different. The relationship of partisanship to
 turnout was low in 1960 but has risen over time.

 The estimates of the validated versus self-

 reported turnout variables with efficacy further
 support the use of the self-reported turnout
 measure, for the impact is not significantly dif-
 ferent from self-reported voting.

 Probit estimates of equations (1-3) for the 1966

 that it takes about 1.97 units of predicted decline to
 yield one unit of actual decline. The reciprocal of the
 slope estimate is 0.507; thus about one-half of the
 decline in turnout can be attributed to the decline in
 "external" efficacy.

 22The chi-square values, analogous to those reported

 in footnote 17, are 30.4 (5 degrees of freedom, a >
 0.999) for the comparison of equation (2) to (1); 14.1 (4
 degrees of freedom, 0.995 < a < 0.999) for comparing
 equation (3) to (2); and 45.7 (10 degrees of freedom, a
 > 0.999) for comparing equation (3) to equation (1)
 estimates.

 through 1978 congressional election years tell
 basically the same story as the results reported
 previously. The estimates of equation (1) suggest
 that about 27 percent of the decline in turnout
 over this period can be attributed to the (by now
 well under way) erosion in feelings of "external"
 efficacy. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation
 (MLE) coefficient of efficacy in equation (12) is
 0.236, a figure lower than in the presidential turn-
 out estimates. In equations (2) and (3), for exam-
 ple, no individual coefficient except those for ef-
 ficacy itself is statistically significant (although the
 cumulative impact is), implying that no single

 election year was significantly different from
 1966.

 On balance, the decline in feelings of
 "external" political efficacy appears to provide a
 partial first-order explanation for the decline in
 electoral participation and may account for about
 one-half the decline in turnout in presidential elec-
 tions. Unfortunately, we do not have an ap-
 propriate baseline for estimating the effect of this
 erosion upon the decline of turnout in off-year
 congressional elections. For the presidential
 voting trend, the decline in beliefs about govern-
 ment effectiveness appears to account for more of
 the decline in turnout than the erosion of partisan
 strength. Given that each of these attitudinal
 trends appears to account for some of the decline
 in turnout, we may now turn to the next logical
 question: What is the combined effect of both
 these attitudinal trends?

 Combined Impact of Decline in Party
 Identification and Decline in Beliefs
 about Government Responsiveness

 The combined impact of the two attitudinal
 trends upon the decline of participation will ob-
 viously depend upon how strongly these two at-
 titudes are related to each other; the maximum
 opportunity for the combined trends to have a
 greater impact on the decline of participation will
 occur if these attitudes are unrelated. As we have
 shown elsewhere (Abramson and Aldrich 1981, p.
 31), strength of party identification and beliefs
 about government responsiveness are largely or-
 thogonal.

 When we classify each respondent according to
 his or her partisan strength and feelings of "exter-
 nal" political efficacy, twelve subgroups emerge.
 We have elsewhere (Abramson and Aldrich 1981,
 p. 32) presented the distribution of the white elec-
 torate according to these two attitudes for all
 twelve surveys in which both attitudes were
 measured. There has been a very substantial shift
 in the distribution of respondents. This shift
 began in 1964 when feelings of "external"
 political efficacy declined and was intensified in
 1966 when strength of party identification
 registered its greatest decline. In 1960, nearly one-
 fourth of the white electorate was in the combined
 category with the highest potential for participa-
 tion-strong partisans with high feelings of "ex-
 ternal" political effectiveness. Since 1972 about
 one white in ten fell in this combined category.
 Change was less dramatic for the category with
 the lowest potential for participation-pure in-
 dependents with low feelings of political efficacy.
 In 1960 fewer than one white in forty was in this
 subgroup; by 1976 and 1978 this group had grown

 to one in sixteen and one in seventeen. In 1980 one
 white in twenty fell in this group. In addition,
 there has been a shift in the relative size of other
 attitude subgroups. Most high-participation
 groups have diminished in size, whereas most low-
 participation groups have grown. (Abramson and
 Aldrich 1981, pp. 33-34, and note 32).

 Table 5 presents the percentage of whites who
 said they voted for president for all the elections
 between 1952 and 1980 among each of the twelve
 attitude subgroups. By reading down each column
 of Table 5 we can examine change in turnout
 among each subgroup. Seven of the subgroups
 registered no consistent change in turnout be-
 tween 1960 and 1980, and two groups, weak par-
 tisans with medium efficacy levels and indepen-
 dent learners with medium efficacy levels,
 registered only a moderate decline (a drop of
 about 1.5 percentage points per quadrennium).
 Three subgroups registered a decline of about
 three percentage points per election: weak par-
 tisans with low feelings of political effectiveness,
 pure independents with high feelings of political
 effectiveness, and pure independents with
 medium levels of political effectiveness.

 To estimate the effects of the combined attitude
 change on the decline of turnout we will use the
 distribution of respondents in each attitude
 subgroup in 1960 as our base and assume that
 levels of turnout for each subgroup would have
 been the same even if there had been no attitude
 change among the electorate. According to our
 algebraic estimates, turnout would have been 80.8
 percent in 1964, 83.5 percent in 1968, 78.5 percent
 in 1972, and 80.7 percent in both 1976 and 1980.
 In every survey from 1964 on, estimated turnout
 with no attitude change is higher than the
 reported turnout (see the last column of Table 5).
 According to the SRC-CPS data, there was a
 decline of 10.3 percentage points in turnout be-
 tween 1960 and 1980. If there had been no decline
 in either partisan strength or in feelings of "exter-
 nal" political efficacy, the decline would have
 been only 2.9 percentage points. In other words,
 just under three-tenths of the decline in turnout
 would have occurred without any change in the
 distribution of these attitudes. Conversely, more
 than seven-tenths of the decline in turnout can be
 attributed to the combined effect of the erosion in
 partisanship and the decline in feelings of "exter-
 nal" political efficacy.

 The "validated" voting results also suggest that
 the combined impact of declining party loyalties
 and eroding feelings of "external" political ef-
 ficacy played a major role in the decline of turn-
 out. According to our algebraic estimates, about
 three-fifths of the decline in presidential turnout
 between 1964 and 1976 resulted from the com-
 bined impact of these two trends. However, given

 the sharp decline of "validated" turnout in 1980,
 the combined impact of these trends accounts for
 only one-third of the decline in turnout between
 1964 and 1980.

 We must wait until 1966 to examine the joint ef-
 fects of these attitudes on voting in off-year con-
 gressional elections. According to our estimates,
 about two-fifths of the decline appears to result
 from the combined impact of these two attitude
 trends.

 The probit estimates of the effects of both party

 and efficacy on turnout are displayed in Table 6.
 In most respects, these results are a straightfor-
 ward combination of those obtained by analyzing
 the two variables separately. All equations fit the
 data well. For the first time, such groups as those
 low in efficacy and independent of party are
 predicted to be-and in fact are-more likely to
 abstain than to vote. Both party and efficacy are
 strongly and positively related to turnout in all
 equations, and there is a very close fit between ac-
 tual and predicted proportionate turnout for the

 54 party-efficacy election-year categorizations.
 Figure 3 presents the results of equation (1).

 The solid line plots the reported turnout for each
 election year; the broken line shows turnout as
 predicted by equation (1). The results look a bit
 like the efficacy figure. The equation (1) estimate
 fits the actual turnout rates very closely for 1960
 through 1968 but underpredicts the drop from
 1968 to 1972 (and therefore misses 1976 and 1980
 somewhat). The algebraic technique suggests that
 about seven-tenths of the increase in abstention is
 due to the changes in the two independent
 variables. Equation (1) predicts 82.3 percent turn-
 out in 1960 and 75.8 percent in 1980, a drop of 6.5
 percentage points. Estimates of equation (1) imply
 that about two-thirds of the decline in turnout is
 due to the drop in Pit and EFFit23.

 23The regression of actual on predicted (via equation

 (1)) turnout rates for each year yields a slope of 1.50,
 with reciprocal of 0.67; hence the two-thirds figure.

 Equations (2) and (3) also display much the
 same patterns as those found earlier. In particu-
 lar, there is a significant improvement in moving
 from equation (1) to (2) and, also, although a
 more minor one, from equation (2) to (3).
 Although statistically significant, the improve-
 ments are only marginal.24 From equation (3), we
 can see that the constant term drops more or less
 consistently and in fact is significantly lower in the
 1970s and 1980s compared to 1960. The estimated
 impact of strength of partisanship is lowest in
 1960 and rises monotonically but apparently in

 two steps. The slope estimates for 1964 and 1968
 are moderately larger than in 1960 and roughly
 identical, whereas those for 1972 through 1980 are
 significantly larger than that of 1960 and of
 roughly the same magnitude. Efficacy was most
 strongly related to turnout in 1960, although the
 decreased impact is but slight from 1968 through
 1980. However, in 1964 the impact of efficacy was
 about one-half that of 1960.

 Once again, the validated vote estimates have

 been compared to the self-reported vote measure
 for the 1964, 1976, and 1980 elections, and once
 again these comparisons yield no surprises. Self-
 reporting is nearly unrelated to the independent
 variables examined here.

 The analysis of congressional election-year
 turnout is confined to the period from 1966
 through 1978. The joint effects of the two varia-
 bles are basically equivalent to the sum of their
 separate effects. Both variables accounted for
 about one-quarter of the decline in turnout sepa-

 rately, and their combined effect, through equa-
 tion (1) estimates, is 49.4 percent.

 Conclusions

 The combined effect of the decline in partisan
 strength and the decline in beliefs about govern-
 ment responsiveness appears to account for be-
 tween two-thirds and seven-tenths of the decline
 in presidential turnout. Although we do not have
 an appropriate baseline for estimating the effects
 of the attitude changes upon the decline of con-
 gressional turnout, the combined trends appear to
 account for about two-fifths to one-half of that
 decline even for the limited period that we were
 able to study.

 This analysis has not attempted a comprehen-
 sive explanation of the changes in attitudes them-
 selves, mainly because the reasons for these atti-
 tude changes have been widely discussed. For
 example, the decline of party identification results
 from the combined impact of generational re-
 placement and the historical forces which eroded
 partisanship between 1964 and 1966 (cf., Abram-
 son 1976; Converse 1976; Glenn 1972), whereas
 the decline in feelings of political effectiveness
 results from more generalized disaffection which
 may be a response to political events (cf., Abram-
 son 1977; Wright 1976; House and Mason 1975;
 Converse 1972). However, even without attempt-
 ing to explain the causes of the attitude changes,
 more complex analyses are possible. One of the
 major areas for future attitude research, which we
 will discuss below, is an attempt to evaluate the
 impact of both short-term and long-term forces
 on the decline of turnout. Analyses of individual-
 level attitude change, which can be explored
 through both the 1956 to 1960 and the 1972 to
 1976 SRC panel studies, may provide insights
 about these forces.

 It should also be recognized that the data pre-
 sented in this article do not account for all of the
 changes in postwar electoral participation. For
 example, the decline in participation between 1968
 and 1972 is greater than one would predict from
 attitude change alone. And these attitudes do not
 account very well for rise in political participation
 between 1952 and 1960.25

 Still, our empirical results are highly satisfac-

 "Approximately one-third of the increased partici-
 pation between 1952 and 1960 can be accounted for by
 increased feelings of "external" political efficacy. How-
 ever the increase in "external" political efficacy oc-
 curred between 1952 and 1956, and participation fell in
 1956. Moreover, increases in participation cannot result
 from changes in partisan loyalties, since partisan
 strength was stable between 1952 and 1960.

 tory. However, they do not discriminate between
 alternative theoretical views of voting behavior.
 For example, our findings are quite consistent
 with the social-psychological view of voting
 behavior. Indeed, the two independent variables
 that we use are firmly grounded in, and derived
 from, this attitudinal view of behavior. We have
 indicated already that the relationships we dis-
 covered would also be predicted by a rational-
 choice orientation, but this last point needs some
 further elaboration, particularly in light of the
 decline in the expressed concern over the electoral
 outcome since 1964 and the importance of this
 ''concern" variable in rational-choice models of
 turnout (Aldrich 1976; Ferejohn and Fiorina
 1979, 1974; Riker and Ordeshook 1968).26

 As Ferejohn and Fiorina (1979) demonstrate,

 since 1964 the electorate's concern with the elec-
 toral outcome has declined, and concern is a good
 predictor of turnout (see also Brody 1978). Fere-
 john and Fiorina claim that the electorate's
 declining concern with which party wins con-
 tributes to a substantial portion of the decline in
 turnout. Since they argue that concern with an
 election's outcome is an election-specific phenom-
 enon, they claim that the decline of turnout does
 not constitute a puzzle.

 Five points are in order. First, the relationship

 between concern and turnout is moderate. Sec-
 ond, although the decline of concern with which
 party wins parallels the decline of turnout, from a
 peak of 69 percent of the whites caring which par-
 ty won in 1960 to a low of 54 percent in 1980, this
 decline is moderate. Third, given the two relation-
 ships above, the total impact of declining concern
 on the turnout trend is also relatively moderate
 and can account for only between one-fifth and
 one-fourth of the decline in turnout among the
 white electorate. Fourth, as Rollenhagen (1981)
 demonstrates, there is a strong relationship be-
 tween strength of party identification and caring
 which party wins; as a result, the combined im-
 pact of these two attitude trends does not account
 for much more of the decline of turnout than the
 effects of declining partisanship taken alone.

 Fifth, we do not accept Ferejohn and Fiorina's
 conclusion that the decline in concern with elec-
 toral outcomes is primarily an election-specific
 phenomenon. We think it would be difficult to
 develop election-specific explanations to account
 for the continual decline in electoral concern
 among whites from 1960 through 1980. We find it
 hard to believe that the decline in concern can be

 16Concern is measured by asking, "Generally speak-
 ing, would you say that you personally care a good deal
 which party wins the presidential election this fall, or
 that you don't care very much which party wins?"

 attributed to the most obvious sources of election-
 specific factors: the two candidates and their
 evaluation by the electorate. If so, why is concern
 lower in 1972 than in 1964? Why would con-
 cern with the outcome be lower in 1968 than in
 1960 or in 1964? Why, despite sharp policy dif-
 ferences between Carter and Reagan, does con-
 cern with which party wins reach its lowest level in
 1980? We find it easier to believe that declining
 concern with electoral outcomes results, at least in
 part, from the same forces eroding partisanship
 and feelings of political effectiveness.

 Indeed, partisanship and concern with the elec-
 toral outcome are closely intertwined, perhaps
 because the concern item specifically refers to car-
 ing which party wins the election. Our own analy-
 ses suggest that in three of the last four presiden-
 tial elections concern with which party wins was
 more strongly related to party identification than
 it was to differential evaluations of the candidates
 as measured by the candidate "thermometers."
 Moreover, assuming that declining party loyalties
 contributed to a declining concern with which par-
 ty wins presidential elections, about one-half of
 the decline in electoral concern among the white
 electorate between 1960 and 1980 can be ac-
 counted for by the weakening of party identifica-
 tion (Rollenhagen 1981). These results strongly
 suggest that the effects of declining electoral con-
 cern upon turnout during the past two decades
 should not be viewed in purely election-specific
 terms but are at least partly systemic.

 If we are correct in concluding that the decline

 of turnout results largely from long-term attitude
 change, our findings must be discouraging to
 Americans who wish turnout to increase. The
 decline in party identification largely results from
 generational replacement, and, given the very low
 levels of partisan loyalties among young adults,
 party loyalties are likely to remain weak for the re-
 mainder of this century. On the other hand, feel-
 ings of "external" political efficacy are somewhat
 stronger among young adults than among their
 elders. Whether beliefs in government responsive-
 ness will in fact increase will probably depend
 mainly upon the future actions of political
 leaders. This article cannot predict those actions,
 but it does suggest that it will be difficult to
 restore higher levels of electoral participation
 unless the attitudes of the American electorate
 toward the political system are changed.
