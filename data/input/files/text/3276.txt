Introduction
Activity-related dyspnea and exercise intolerance
are important features of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD) that negatively impact
on ability to perform activities of daily living. As
such, evaluating exercise tolerance is now consid-
ered to be an essential component of disease
assessment.1 Of available exercise-testing proto-
cols, constant work-rate exercise tests, such as
cycle and treadmill endurance tests and the
endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), are the
most sensitive for detecting change in exercise
capacity following intervention (pharmacologic
and nonpharmacologic).2
Over the past several years, constant work-rate
cycle ergometry (CWRCE) has been used exten-
sively in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of

Abstract
Background: The TORRACTO® study evaluated the effects of tiotropium/olodaterol versus
placebo on endurance time during constant work-rate cycling and constant speed shuttle
walking in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after 12 weeks of
treatment.
Methods: The effects of once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5 g) on endurance
time during constant work-rate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment
were compared with placebo in patients with COPD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Endurance time during the endurance shuttle walk
test (ESWT) after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment was also evaluated in a subset of patients.
Results: A total of 404 patients received treatment, with 165 participating in the ESWT
substudy. A statistically significant improvement in endurance time during CWRCE was
observed after 12 weeks (primary endpoint) with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg [14% (p =
0.02)] but not with tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg [9% (p = 0.14)] versus placebo. In the
ESWT substudy, a trend to improvement in endurance time during ESWT after 12 weeks (key
secondary endpoint) was observed with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg [21% (p = 0.055)] and
tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg [21% (p = 0.056)] versus placebo.
Conclusion: Tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg improved endurance time during cycle ergometry
versus placebo, with a strong tendency to also improve walking endurance time.

long-acting bronchodilators in patients with
COPD,2,3 and is often included in clinical devel-
opment programs as a complementary assess-
ment of efficacy, alongside traditional assessments
of lung function. There is, however, a debate
regarding the most appropriate endurance exer-
cise testing protocol.2,4­7 In this regard, there has
been recent interest in the ESWT,7­11 in some
part due to a view that field walking tests are more
reflective of activities performed by patients in
everyday life.12
The TORRACTO® study was part of a clinical
program evaluating the efficacy and safety of tio-
tropium/olodaterol in patients with COPD.
TORRACTO® was designed to evaluate two
doses of tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5 µg)
compared with placebo on exercise endurance
time (EET) during CWRCE in patients with
COPD in a parallel-group design after 12 weeks
of treatment. Secondary objectives were to evalu-
ate EET during the ESWT after 6 and 12 weeks
of treatment with tiotropium/olodaterol in a sub-
set of patients.
Methods
TORRACTO® [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01525615] was a multicenter, multinational,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group trial to evaluate the effects of once-
daily tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5 g)
compared with placebo on exercise tolerance after
12 weeks of treatment in patients with COPD (5/5
g is the approved tiotropium/olodaterol dose).
The primary evaluation of exercise tolerance was
based on EET during CWRCE, while evaluation
of EET during ESWT was conducted in a subset
of patients (ESWT subgroup).
The study was conducted at 58 centers in 10
countries. The ESWT substudy was conducted at
a subset of 26 sites with experience in the ESWT;
all patients at the selected sites were asked to par-
ticipate in the substudy.
Patients
Patients aged 40­75 years with a clinical diagno-
sis of COPD and stable airway obstruction were
included if they had postbronchodilator forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1
)/forced vital
capacity (FVC) <70% and postbronchodilator
FEV1
<80% and 30% predicted normal.
Patients were current or exsmokers with a smok-
ing history of >10 pack-years. Exclusion criteria
are detailed in the online supplement.
Study design
During screening, patients performed spirometry
to determine study eligibility. Eligible patients
were randomized to receive one of three treat-
ments: tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 g, tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 5/5 g, or placebo, all delivered
once daily via the Respimat® (Boehringer
Ingelheim International GmbH, Ingelheim am
Rhein, Germany) inhaler (Figure 1).
Throughout the 12-week treatment period, trial
medication was self-administered by the patient
once daily between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.; on test
days, administration of trial medication was per-
formed under research staff supervision. Patients
continued with inhaled corticosteroids if taken at
baseline. Open-label salbutamol (albuterol) was
provided as rescue medication throughout the
study.
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International
Conference on Harmonization Tripartite
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Before the
study started, the protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Boards, and
all patients provided written, informed consent.
Pulmonary function testing
Spirometry (FEV1
, FVC) was performed using
standard methodology.13 FEV1

immediately before the first dose of trial medication
at the randomization visit was a priori defined as the
pretreatment baseline. Spirometry was also per-
formed 1 h postdose at the randomization visit, and
predose and 1 h postdose after 6 and 12 weeks of
treatment.
Incremental cycle ergometry and constant
work-rate cycle ergometry
The specific details of both incremental cycle
ergometry and CWRCE have been described pre-
viously.14­16 During run-in, patients performed
incremental cycle ergometry to symptom limita-
tion to determine peak work rate (Wpeak), the
highest work rate maintained for 30 s. Two
CWRCE tests to symptom limitation at 75%
Wpeak were performed during run-in: the first
test familiarized the patient with the exercise pro-
tocol, while the second test 4 days later was a
priori defined as the pretreatment baseline. To
avoid excessively long endurance times that may
be limited by motivation rather than physiology/
symptoms, patients with an endurance time of
>25 min in training or baseline CWRCE were not
eligible for randomization. CWRCE at weeks 6
and 12 was performed 2 h postdose. Additional
information is provided in the online supplement.
Incremental and endurance shuttle walking
(endurance shuttle walk test substudy)
Patients included in the ESWT substudy per-
formed an incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT)
2­4 days after the initial screening visit.17 At 2­4
days after the baseline and training CWRCE
tests, training and baseline ESWTs were per-
formed at a walking speed corresponding to 85%
of the peak oxygen consumption estimated from
the ISWT.8 The ESWT was repeated at the same
walking speed after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment,
2 h postdose, again with a 2­4-day separation
between the CWRCE and ESWT. Both the
ISWT and ESWT were performed in an enclosed
corridor on a flat 10-meter-long course. Patients
who completed the highest level in the ISWT
were not eligible for the substudy because a walk-
ing speed for the ESWT could not be established
for these patients. Patients with an endurance
time during the training or baseline ESWT of
>15 min were excluded from the ESWT sub-
study due to the limited (20-min) duration of the
audio used for pacing the ESWT. These patients
did continue in the main part of the study
(CWRCE). Further details are provided in the
online supplement.
Breathing discomfort, leg discomfort, and
inspiratory capacity
During CWRCE and ESWT, patients rated
intensity of breathing discomfort and leg discom-
fort using the modified Borg scale18 at rest, during
each 2-min interval during exercise, and at the
end of exercise. During CWRCE (but not ESWT)
patients also performed an inspiratory capacity
(IC) maneuver after each rating of breathing and
leg discomfort. Immediately after completing
exercise, patients were asked to identify the pri-
mary reason for stopping exercise using a previ-
ously described questionnaire.19
Safety assessments
At each visit, adverse events (AEs) reported by
the patient were recorded irrespective of causal-
ity. Pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood
pressure were measured at each clinic visit imme-
diately prior to spirometry. Clinical laboratory
testing (hematology, blood chemistry, and uri-
nalysis) and a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram
were performed at screening and at week 12.
Efficacy endpoints
The primary endpoint was EET during CWRCE
after 12 weeks of treatment. Owing to the skew-
ness of the EET data during CWRCE,20 the pri-
mary analysis was prespecified to be based on the
logarithm to the base 10 of EET during CWRCE.
The key secondary endpoint was EET during
ESWT after 12 weeks of treatment (ESWT sub-
group), also based on log10
-transformed data.
Other exercise-related efficacy endpoints included
pre-exercise, isotime, and end-exercise IC during
CWRCE, and intensity of breathing and leg dis-
comfort during CWRCE and ESWT.
Isotime for each patient was defined as the mini-
mum EET among the pretreatment baseline,
week 6, and week 12 CWRCE tests. Isovalue was
defined as the value of a specific parameter at iso-
time. This isovalue could be an observed value
(e.g. when it occurred at the end of exercise) or it
could be determined by interpolation between the
values at the two time points immediately above
and below the isotime.

FEV1
and FVC (trough and 1 h postdose) were
also measured to confirm bronchodilator efficacy.
Statistical analysis
Mean log10
EETs from CWRCE and ESWT were
analyzed using a restricted maximum likelihood-
based mixed-effects model repeated measure
(MMRM) approach. Analyses included the fixed,
categorical effect of treatment, test day, and treat-
ment-by-test-day interaction, as well as the continu-
ous, fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-
by-test-day interaction. The baseline covariate term
also used the logarithm to the base 10. The primary
analysis was performed on the full analysis set (i.e. all
randomized patients who received at least one dose
of treatment, and who had both baseline and at least
one postbaseline measurement at or before 12 weeks
for the primary efficacy endpoints).
Based on a previous trial,21 an appropriate esti-
mate of the standard deviation for log10
EET from
CWRCE was 0.206; with this standard deviation,
a sample size of 130 patients per group provided
90% power to detect a 21% improvement in EET
during CWRCE.
Analyses for EET during CWRCE at 12 weeks
(primary endpoint), EET during ESWT at 12
weeks (key secondary endpoint), and pre-exercise
IC during CWRCE at 12 weeks (secondary end-
point) were included in a step-down hierarchical
testing strategy. Testing strategy details are pro-
vided in the online supplement (Figure S1).
The same MMRM approach was adopted for all
other continuous secondary endpoints. Adjusted
mean values as well as treatment contrasts were
presented, together with 95% confidence inter-
vals. Secondary endpoints (i.e. other than EET
during ESWT and pre-exercise IC at 12 weeks)
were not included in the step-down hypothesis-
testing hierarchy and are considered descriptive
(nominal p values).
All treated patients were included in the safety
analyses, which were descriptive in nature.
Results
Patient disposition and baseline characteristics
A total of 404 patients were randomized and
received treatment (Figure 2), with 385 included
in the full analysis set.
Baseline patient characteristics for the treated set are
shown in Table 1. Overall, 73% were Global
Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
stage 2, with mean predicted normal FEV1
of 58.6%.
Baseline exercise-specific patient characteristics
for the treated set are shown in Table 2. Baseline
characteristics were generally well balanced across
treatment groups.
A total of 165 patients were included in the
ESWT subgroup. Baseline patient characteristics
and exercise-specific characteristics for the ESWT
subgroup are shown in Tables 1 and 3, respec-
tively. Baseline characteristics were generally well
balanced across treatment groups.
Two patients had an EET during CWRCE at
baseline of >25 min (i.e. screen failure); 11
patients had an EET during ESWT at baseline of
>15 min (i.e. not included in the ESWT sub-
study, but continued in the main study).
Constant work-rate cycle ergometry (full
analysis set)
Common baseline geometric mean EET [stand-
ard error (SE)] during CWRCE was 443.0 (12.4)
s. Geometric mean (SE) EET during CWRCE at
week 12 (primary endpoint) was 463.6 (18.8) s
for placebo, 503.6 (19.6) s for tiotropium/
olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and 527.5 (20.2) s for tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 5/5 µg, with a statistically signifi-
cant increase of 13.8% compared with placebo
for tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg (p = 0.02) and
an increase of 8.6% compared with placebo for
tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg (p = 0.14) (Figure
3). Since the comparison for tiotropium/olo-
daterol 2.5/5 µg compared with placebo did not
reach statistical significance, subsequent hypoth-
esis tests within the step-down hypothesis-testing
strategy are considered descriptive rather than
confirmatory (nominal p values).
Geometric mean (SE) EET at week 6 was 427.7
(17.1) s for placebo, 522.3 (20.2) s for tiotropium/
olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and 525.6 (20.0) s for tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 5/5 µg, with a 22.9% increase
compared with placebo for tiotropium/olodaterol
5/5 µg (nominal p = 0.0002) and a 22.1% increase
compared with placebo for tiotropium/olodaterol
2.5/5 µg (nominal p = 0.0004) (Figure 3).
The common mean IC values at baseline
were: pre-exercise, 2397 ml; isotime, 2131 ml; and
F Maltais, D O'Donnell et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 5
end-exercise, 2111 ml. Mean IC increased at pre-
exercise, isotime, and end-exercise for both tiotro-
pium/olodaterol doses compared with placebo at
weeks 6 and 12 (Figure 4a) (nominal p < 0.05 at
all time points for tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 and
5/5 µg).
The rate of increase in intensity of breathing dis-
comfort (Borg scale) during exercise [(end of
exercise Borg score minus pre-exercise Borg
score)/EET] was lower for both tiotropium/olo-
daterol doses compared with placebo at weeks 6
and 12 (Figure 4b) (nominal p = 0.0218 for tio-
tropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg and p = 0.0598 for
tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg at week 12).
For both tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 and 5/5 µg,
increases in FEV1
and FVC were observed 1 h
after the first dose, and predose and 1 h postdose
after 6 and 12 weeks.
Endurance shuttle walking (ESWT substudy)
Common baseline geometric mean EET (SE) dur-
ing ESWT was 311.2 (13.7) s. Geometric mean
(SE) EET during ESWT at week 12 (key secondary
endpoint) was 311.4 (22.5) s for placebo, 377.2
(25.9) s for tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and
376.4 (25.0) s for tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg, with
an increase of 20.9% compared with placebo for
tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg (nominal p = 0.055)
and an increase of 21.1% compared with placebo
for tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg (nominal p =
0.056) (Figure 5). One patient on placebo, four
patients on tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and two
patients on tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg reached
test termination (i.e. 20-min duration).
Geometric mean (SE) ESWT EET at week 6 was
312.0 (22.5) s for placebo, 377.9 (25.8) s for tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and 376.2 (24.9) s for
tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg, with an increase of
20.6% compared with placebo for tiotropium/olo-
daterol 5/5 µg (nominal p = 0.058) and an increase
of 21.1% compared with placebo for tiotropium/
olodaterol 2.5/5 µg (nominal p = 0.055) (Figure 5).
No patients on placebo, three patients on tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and two patients on tio-
tropium 5/5 µg reached test termination (i.e.
20-min duration).

comparison to the log10
-transformed data [online
supplement Tables S2 and S3 (CWRCE) and
Tables S4 and S5 (ESWT)]. Using the arithmetic
data, there were 25.0 and 14.4% increases in EET
during CWRCE with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg
over placebo at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively.
Safety (treated set)
Incidences of AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to
discontinuation with tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5
and 5/5 µg were similar to placebo (online supple-
ment Table S6). Most AEs were mild to moderate
in severity and not considered related to study
medication by the investigator. The most common
AE was COPD exacerbation, which occurred in
12.1%, 11.3%, and 7.2% of patients receiving pla-
cebo, tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg, and tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 5/5 µg, respectively. Two deaths
occurred during the study, both in patients receiv-
ing tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg: one patient died
from lung cancer and the other from cardio-respir-
atory arrest (this event did not occur during the
exercise testing). Neither was considered related to
study drug by the investigator.
Discussion
In this study, tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg
increased EET during CWRCE by 13.8% com-
pared with placebo after 12 weeks in patients with
moderate to severe COPD (primary endpoint). In
the ESWT substudy, a 20.9% increase in EET
for tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg compared with
placebo after 12 weeks did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.055).
The effects of tiotropium/olodaterol on EET dur-
ing CWRCE in moderate to very severe COPD
have also been investigated in two replicate, dou-
ble-blind, crossover studies of 6-week duration
(MORACTO®).22 Similar to the present study,
the MORACTO® studies evaluated two doses of
tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5 µg), and
included placebo, tiotropium 5 µg alone, and olo-
daterol 5 µg alone as comparator arms to evaluate
the efficacy of tiotropium/olodaterol compared
with placebo and its added benefit over the indi-
vidual monotherapies. The TORRACTO® study
was designed to complement the MORACTO®
studies by determining whether the effects of tio-
tropium/olodaterol compared with placebo on

EET during CWRCE were maintained up to 12
weeks to document the duration of effect.
EET during CWRCE for tiotropium/olodaterol
5/5 µg was similar at 6 weeks (geometric mean:
525.6 s) and 12 weeks (geometric mean: 527.5
s), representing 18.6 and 19.1% improve-
ments, respectively, compared with a baseline
geometric mean EET of 443.0 s. Statistically
significant improvements in EET for tiotro-
pium/olodaterol 5/5 µg compared with placebo
were observed after both 6 and 12 weeks, with
differences in response magnitude (22.9%
improvement after 6 weeks, 13.8% improve-
ment after 12 weeks) explained by variability in
EET in the placebo arm (geometric means of
427.7 and 463.6 s after 6 and 12 weeks,
respectively).

Tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg did not achieve
statistical significance for the primary endpoint
(EET during CWRCE after 12 weeks). However,
several lines of evidence point to an effect of the
lower dose on exercise endurance: (i) tiotropium/
olodaterol 2.5/5 µg significantly improved EET
during CWRCE compared with placebo in both
MORACTO® studies [26.5% (p < 0.0001) and
12.1% (p = 0.0003)]; (ii) there was a nominally
significant improvement in EET during CWRCE
after 6 weeks (22.1%, nominal p = 0.0004) in the
present study; (iii) in post hoc analysis, change
from baseline in EET during CWRCE after 6 and
12 weeks was nominally significant.
Endurance time during ESWT has been used as
an outcome measure in pulmonary rehabilitation
studies for many years.23 Recently, there has been
increased attention on ESWT as a methodology to
evaluate bronchodilator efficacy. Early single-
center studies provided promising results, showing
that endurance time during ESWT offered a sensi-
tive test to assess bronchodilation in patients with
COPD.7,9­11 However, multicenter, multinational
studies have value in supporting generalizability, as
has been done for CWRCE.21,24­32 At the time of
study initiation in March 2012, there were no pub-
lished studies using a multicenter trial with ESWT
to evaluate the effects of pharmacotherapy in
COPD. The first multicenter study was conducted
in 2010­2011, with results published in 2013.33
Two replicate, multicenter studies were conducted
in 2011­2012, with results published in 2014.34
The present study adds to the knowledge about
the use of ESWT to assess the effects of bron-
chodilation on exercise capacity in patients with
COPD in a multicenter setting. Based on the
methodologic concerns regarding the transition
from a single-center to a multicenter setting, a
high degree of attention was placed on trial over-
sight with respect to the training and monitoring
of the ESWT. Details of these quality control
efforts are described in the online supplement as
reference for other researchers interested in con-
ducting multicenter studies using ESWT. The
ESWT performed well in this trial; the lack of a
learning effect in the placebo arm (i.e. similar
EET in placebo arm at baseline and after 6 and
12 weeks) suggests that study participants were
able to produce reproducible exercise tests.
Future efforts to determine the minimal quality
control criteria in multicenter ESWT studies are
warranted.
Although statistical significance was just missed (p
= 0.055), the observed 20% improvement in EET
in ESWT at 6 and 12 weeks with both doses of
tiotropium/olodaterol is beyond the proposed min-
imally important difference for this parameter.35
With the recognition that the ESWT has a fixed
test termination of 20 min,8 study eligibility criteria
included a baseline EET of <15 min to allow for
sufficient post-treatment endurance times within
the 20-min test. This was the case for the majority
of patients, but one patient in the placebo group,
four patients in the tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg

group, and two patients in the tiotropium/olo-
daterol 5/5 µg group reached the 20-min test ter-
mination time point during ESWT after 12 weeks
(i.e. did not reach symptom limitation). This may
have contributed to reducing the statistical power
of the study. A more recent study (PHYSACTO®),
with a greater sample size than the present study
(65­72 patients per treatment arm), has shown
significant improvements in EET during ESWT
after 8 weeks of treatment with tiotropium/olo-
daterol compared with placebo in patients who
participated in a self-management behavior-change
program (29% increase, p < 0.01).23
An important methodologic consideration in rela-
tion to the current trial is that statistical analyses
were performed on log10
-transformed endurance
time data. Although these analyses are justified in
that endurance time during constant work-rate
exercise is asymmetrically distributed around the
mean, with a significant skew towards long
EETs,20,36 this approach complicates compari-
sons with previous trials.
For the purpose of facilitating comparisons across
studies, we also report arithmetic mean treatment
effects of tiotropium/olodaterol versus placebo,
which ranged from 118 s to 124 s, or ~25%
increase over placebo for CWRCE at week 6.
Despite expected differences in adjusted mean
values between untransformed and log10
-trans-
formed approaches, relative (%) increases in EET
for active treatment arms versus placebo and the
respective statistical significances were very simi-
lar for the two statistical approaches, supporting
the robustness of the findings.
The improvements in EET versus placebo are
consistent with what is expected from single and
dual long-acting bronchodilators.21,25,28,32,36,37
Also, increases in EET in CWRCE with active
treatments in the present study were beyond the
estimated range for a clinically meaningful differ-
ence, compared with placebo, of 46­105 s for
endurance time, as proposed by the European
Respiratory Society task force on outcomes in
COPD.38 Despite not reaching formal statistical
significance, the increase in EET during ESWT,
averaging 81­88 s or 21% at week 6, compared
advantageously with previous publications (121 s,
31% at 3 weeks;39 47 s, 15% at 12 weeks34). The
increase in EET during ESWT with tiotropium/
olodaterol was also beyond the proposed clini-
cally meaningful difference.35
The primary evidence of clinical efficacy to sup-
port the health authority approval of tiotropium/
olodaterol 5/5 µg was based on the observed effects
on lung function (FEV1
) and health-related qual-
ity of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire)
in the 52-week TONADO® studies. However,
exercise capacity has been recommended as an
important additional clinical outcome in COPD
pharmacologic trials.40 The results from the pre-
sent TORRACTO® study, as well as from the pre-
viously reported MORACTO® studies, extend the
clinical evaluation of tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg,
and provide a more complete characterization of
therapeutic benefit at the impairment-disability
interface. The results show that the primary effects
of tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg on lung function
lead to clinically meaningful downstream improve-
ments in the capacity to perform different types of
exercise (cycling, walking), which is arguably a
more meaningful outcome to patients with COPD,
who struggle to perform daily activities due to
exertional breathlessness.
Conclusion
Tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg improved endur-
ance time during cycle ergometry versus placebo,
with a strong tendency to also improve walking
endurance.
