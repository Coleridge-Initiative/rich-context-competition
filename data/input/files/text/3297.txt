Abstract
Objective: Embedding clinical pharmacists into ambulatory care settings needs to be assessed in
the context of established medical home models.
Methods: A retrospective, observational study examined the effectiveness of the Intermountain
Healthcare Collaborative Pharmacist Support Services (CPSS) program from 2012­2015 among
adult patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or high blood pressure (HBP). Patients
who attended this program were considered the intervention (CPSS) cohort. These patients were
matched using propensity scores with a reference group (no-CPSS cohort) to determine the effect
of achieving disease management goals and time to achievement.
Results: A total of 17,684 patients had an in-person office visit with their provider and 359
received CPSS (the matched no-CPSS cohort included 999 patients). CPSS patients were 93%
more likely to achieve a blood pressure goal < 140/90 mmHg, 57% more likely to achieve HbA1c
values < 8%, and 87% more likely to achieve both disease management goals compared with the
reference group. Time to goal achievement demonstrated increasing separation between the study
cohorts across the entire study period (P <.001), and specifically, at 180 days post-intervention
(HBP: 48% vs 27% P <.001 and DM: 39% vs 30%, P <.05).
Conclusions: CPSS participation is associated with significant improvement in achievement of
disease management goals, time to achievement, and increased ambulatory encounters compared
with the matched no-CPSS cohort.

Background
Currently, organizations are charged with
improving the population's health, by
``improving the health outcomes of a group
of individuals'', to efficiently transition
towards new mechanisms of value-based
care delivery and population-based pay-
ment.1 These changes have reinforced the
role of primary care in meeting the growing
healthcare needs of the population and
coordinating access to specialty services,
while controlling overall healthcare spend-
ing.2 However, optimization of care delivery
modalities is still required among high-
performing practices. Embedding a clinical
pharmacist in an ambulatory care setting,
including primary care, is a growing trend.
Data have been published to support
improvement in patients' care and decreased
healthcare costs when pharmacists are
added to the care team.3­5
Involvement of clinical pharmacists
improves clinical outcomes in many disease
states, and improves patients' satisfac-
tion.5­8 Optimizing medication regimens to
meet clinical goals and prevent adverse
events is the clinical pharmacist's specialty.
Having a pharmacist included in patients'
care improves medication-related quality
measures and reduces errors. These same
quality and safety metrics are increasingly
tied to reimbursement and population
health management initiatives.4
Outcomes from involvement of a clinical
pharmacist in the care of patients with high
blood pressure (HBP) and/or diabetes (DM)
have been highlighted in several previous
clinical trials.9­14 Hirsch et al.9 found that
using a pharmacist for drug therapy man-
agement for hypertension resulted in a
higher rate of patients reaching a blood
pressure target (88.5%) compared with
usual care (63.6%). Comprehensive man-
agement of DM by clinical pharmacists
within primary care practices shows
improvement in numerous diabetes-related
outcomes, including a greater likelihood of
reaching hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood
pressure, and low density lipo-protein
(LDL) targets compared with patients
receiving care in a clinic without a pharma-
cist as a member of the healthcare team.14
Each of the above-mentioned studies
showed positive associations when a pharma-
cist was integrated into the care team.
However, this study analyzed the effective-
ness of the Intermountain Healthcare (IH)
Collaborative Pharmacist Support Services
(CPSS) program, which was deployed in
established primary care medical home prac-
tices. The IH CPSS program emphasizes
partnership and collaboration between clin-
ical pharmacists and primary care teams,
rather than co-location of services. CPSS
provides efficiency in care delivery by max-
imizing the role of the pharmacist. This
provides a benefit to physicians who lack
the ability to actively provide additional
care interactions. This program uniquely
incorporates collaborative drug therapy
management agreements that include the
following: developing and executing
treatment plans; and managing medications,
including selection, titration, monitoring,
and medication adjustments, while support-
ing existing relationships between patients
and their care teams.
However, whether the IH CPSS can
support short-term improvement and
enhance current clinical goal achievement
among patients with DM and HBP are still
Brunisholz et al. 235
unknown. These chronic diseases have pre-
viously been demonstrated to have excellent
baseline disease management at IH.15 This
study evaluated the immediate effect of the
IH CPSS to determine the associated clinical
and healthcare use patterns among enrolled
patients compared with patients with these
conditions from a neighboring geographical
region who did not participate.
Methods
A retrospective, observational design was
used to study the effectiveness of the IH
CPSS program, which was implemented in
seven pilot clinics among patients diagnosed
with HBP and/or DM. Patients who were
enrolled in CPSS were considered the inter-
vention cohort. The CPSS group was
matched using propensity scores (defined
below) with a reference group comprising
patients who were selected from an adjacent
geographic region within the healthcare
system (no-CPSS cohort). This matching
was performed to determine the effect of
achieving disease management goals and
time to achievement, increasing the number
of clinical encounters, and improving the
overall efficiency of care teams.
Study setting
IH is an integrated delivery system of 22
hospitals. IH is also a medical group with
more than 185 ambulatory physician clinics
and approximately 1100 primary and sec-
ondary care physicians. This system has an
affiliated health plan that provides more
than half of all healthcare services within
Utah and southeastern Idaho.16 IH's mis-
sion, ``to help people live the healthiest lives
possible,'' is actualized through a clinical
integration structure that drives clinical
work processes. This is achieved through a
culture of accountable leadership, continu-
ous quality improvement, and measurement
of patients' outcomes and delivery system
costs.16 IH's Enterprise Data Warehouse
collects source data from its integrated
health plan and the electronic medical
record (EMR). The resulting data infra-
structure means that every patient who is
treated at an IH inpatient or outpatient
facility contributes structured data for
formal learning. Therefore, IH is an example
of a learning healthcare system, where
routine state-of-the-art patient care also
produces rapid advances in formal medical
knowledge.
CPSS program
Clinical pharmacists embedded in primary
care medical home practices have multiple
patient care responsibilities, with co-manage-
ment of DM and hypertension representing
approximately 50% of the pharmacists'
responsibilities. Patients with DM, HBP, or
a combination of the two, are identified for
referral to the clinical pharmacist by either a
primary care provider directly or review of
system population health management
reports (Figure 1). The majority of patients
are referred to the pharmacist for manage-
ment of HBP when systolic blood pressure
is> 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure
is> 90mmHg, and for management of DM
when HbA1c values are > 8%. Additionally,
patients who were escalating medications or
dosages were considered for referral.
However, there were no strict exclusion
criteria for referral.
Clinical pharmacists were employed by
IH and devoted 100% of their time to the
intervention. Selection criteria for clinical
pharmacists required board certification and
an established training process (i.e., mentor-
ing, testing and peer-review of clinical
competencies) before full integration began.
Upon referral, the clinical pharmacist
assumed responsibility for co-management
of DM and/or hypertension under a
Collaborative Drug Therapy Management
(CDTM) agreement. The CDTM agreement
236 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
Figure 1. Collaborative Pharmacy Model: algorithm for the pharmacy medical management care process.
Brunisholz et al. 237
authorizes the pharmacist to initiate,
modify, and discontinue medication ther-
apy, order labs (i.e, HbA1c, Basic Metabolic
Panel, Serum Creatinine), provide educa-
tion, refer patients to other healthcare pro-
fessionals, and provide ongoing monitoring
and follow-up. Care was individualized and
there were attempts to provide avenues that
best suited the needs of the enrolled patients.
Three attempts at phone calls were made by
the clinical pharmacist to enroll each patient
who was referred for the services. When
contact attempts by phone were not success-
ful, a letter was sent to patients informing
them of the services and seeking their par-
ticipation. Referrals were tracked and rea-
sons noted in the electronic medical record if
a patient was not enrolled. Once enrolled,
pharmacists delivered care free of charge
because there was no mechanism to bill for
services. Pharmacists provided follow-up
every 1 to 4 weeks via face-to-face visits,
telephone visits, or secure electronic
messaging.
Study participants
Patients who were enrolled in CPSS between
July 2012 and April 2015 were eligible for
inclusion in the intervention group (CPSS).
Patients were only included in the interven-
tion group for analysis if they had an out-of-
control condition (HBP and/or DM) at
enrollment and a corresponding outcome
measure (i.e., blood pressure measurement
or HbA1c test) during the follow-up period.
Independent chart review was performed by
the research team (P.T. and E.H.) to ensure
participation in CPSS and adjudicate results
that were observed.
A reference, or control group (no-CPSS),
was selected from an adult population (! 18
years) who was determined from IH's net-
work of outpatient clinics. Patients were
included in the no-CPSS group if they fit the
following criteria: 1) they were previously
diagnosed with HBP or met the national
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and
Information Set (HEDIS)17 criteria for
DM, and 2) had a visit to a primary care
provider within a established medical home
practice located in an adjacent geographic
region between July 2012 and May 2015. All
IH practices included in the study (i.e.,
intervention and control practices) were
high-performing, routinized medical home
practices with a similar team composition,
including nurse care managers and mental
health specialists. However, patients who
were included in the no-CPSS group did not
have access to a clinical pharmacist included
as a member of the team. The earliest visit
encounter date for each patient within the
study period was used as the no-CPSS study
enrollment date. This study was approved
by the IH's institutional review board
(#1050294) and was granted a waiver of
informed consent and documentation of
consent for all eligible patients who were
considered for analysis.
Measurements
Baseline measures. Patients were compared
within the study groups to assess if
differences in patients' demographics and
clinical characteristics were present prior to
enrollment in the study. Baseline
demographics included age, sex, race, ethni-
city, and insurance status. Information on
current smoking status at the time of enroll-
ment was collected. Clinical characteristics
for the study cohort included the proportion
of patients with chronic conditions prior to
enrollment in the study, including depres-
sion, DM, and HBP. Criteria for chronic
conditions were standardized by an internal
expert committee of practicing providers
(Appendix Table A1). The most recent
clinical biometric measures ( 12 months
prior to enrollment) were collected and
included body mass index (BMI) (BMI
classes: underweight, normal, overweight,
and obese), HbA1c levels, and systolic and
238 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
diastolic blood pressure. Medications that
were ordered prior to enrollment in the
study were also included and categorized
based on their class (anti-hypertensive, met-
formin, diabetes medications, including
injectable and oral therapy other than
metformin, and statins). Information on
the number of patients per primary care
physician (PCP) and the number of PCPs
per clinic was collected at the practice level
for each of the participating clinics.
Outcome measures. The primary outcome
measure for the study was achievement of
disease management goals as follows. 1)
Control of Blood Pressure (BP) was defined
by achieving < 140/90 mmHg for the general
population and < 150/90 mmHg for patients
aged ! 80 years within 7 months. 2) Control
of DM was defined as HbA1c values < 8%
within 12 months. The cutoffs were selected
by the research team a priori to allow for a
window of time for patients to return to
their PCP after baseline measurement.
Secondary measures included time to the
disease management goal and the number of
encounters with additional members of the
care team that were required to achieve
disease management goals. The time to goals
was defined as days between study enroll-
ment and first in-control measurement
during the follow-up period. An encounter
with the care team was defined as any type of
ambulatory interaction with the patient.
This encounter could have been a phone
call or visit in person with a pharmacist,
PCP, specialist, or other member of the
primary care management team.
Statistical analysis. Patients were matched at a
1:4 ratio (intervention to control) based on
propensity score methodology using the
nearest neighbor technique.18 This method-
ology was operationalized by first, including
potential confounders within a logit model,
to predict the propensity for treatment (i.e.,
participation in CPSS).19 Matching
characteristics included age, sex, race/ethni-
city, insurance status, disease status and
duration (HBP, DM, and depression),
BMI, number of patients per PCP panel,
and number of PCPs at the clinic. This
weighting method produced an average
treatment effect on the treated estimates,
answering the question ``Among control
patients closely resembling CPSS patients,
what outcomes were associated with the
intervention?''18
Study group demographics were com-
pared using chi-square analysis for categor-
ical variables and the t-test for continuous
data. Conditional logistic regression was
used to test the null hypothesis that the
association of achieving disease manage-
ment goals was not different between par-
ticipants and non-participants. Odds ratios
were generated after accounting for demo-
graphic and clinical characteristic differ-
ences to assess the likelihood of achieving
disease management goals. Non-adjusted
Kaplan­Meier survival curves were used to
visually compare achievement of clinical
goals over time between the study groups.
Incidence rates (number of events per
patient-years) were used to test the associ-
ation of participation in CPSS and the
number of encounters with the care team
within the study period. An incidence rate
ratio with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals were computed to determine the
probability of an event occurring between
study groups. For all analyses, a two-sided P
value .05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. All data were analyzed using Stata
12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Results
A total of 17,684 patients were identified
within the IH delivery system as meeting the
selection criteria for CPSS during the study
period. A total of 489 individuals were
referred to the CPSS program. However,
56 patients were excluded from analysis
Brunisholz et al. 239
because they were referred for management
of hyperlipidemia and 74 were referred, but
never enrolled in CPSS. Patients who
received CPSS (n ¼ 359) were matched,
using previously described propensity score
matching, to a no-CPSS cohort (n ¼ 999). In
the CPSS group, 93 (25.9%) patients had
HBP, 22 (6.1%) had DM, and 244 (68.0%)
had both diagnoses.
Baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics are shown in Table 1. No signifi-
cant differences in age, female sex, race/
ethnicity, type of insurance, smoking status,
duration and prevalence of HBP and/or
DM, prevalence of depression, baseline
BMI (kg/m2), and BMI class were found
between patients in the reference and inter-
vention groups. CPSS patients were signifi-
cantly more likely to already be on
established evidence-based medication regi-
mens, including anti-hypertensives, metfor-
min, and oral and injectable diabetes
medications excluding metformin compared
with controls (P < .001). CPSS patients were
more likely to have higher HbA1c values
(P < .001), and systolic (P < .001) and dia-
stolic (P ¼ .05) blood pressure when aver-
aged over the last 12 months from
enrollment compared with controls.
After a priori adjustment for confounders
(see Table 2), patients in the CPSS group were
93% more likely to achieve a BP goal
of < 140/90mmHg (Odds Ratio (OR)¼
1.93; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)¼ 1.40,
2.65; P < .001), 57% more likely to achieve
HbA1c values of < 8% (OR ¼ 1.57; 95%
CI¼ 1.06, 2.34; P < .026), and 87% more
likely to achieve both disease management
goals (OR ¼ 1.87; 95% CI¼ 1.41, 2.50;
P < .001) compared with the reference
group. In Kaplan­Meier survival analysis,
the time to achievement of goals showed
increasing separation between the study
cohorts across the entire study period
(P < .001), especially at 180 days post-inter-
vention (HBP: 48% vs 27% P < .001 and type
2 DM: 39% vs. 30%, P < .05) (Figure 2).
Within the CPSS cohort, there were sig-
nificantly more ambulatory clinical visits
compared with the no-CPSS cohort (8.4 vs.
5.1 visits per patient-year, P < .001) (Table
3). In the CPSS group, there were 1742
encounters with the clinical pharmacist,
averaging 3.07 visits per patient-year (med-
ian ¼ 3 visits) during enrollment in the
study. The number of visits to primary
care, specialty care, and care managers
(registered nurses) were all significantly
higher in the CPSS group compared with
the no-CPSS group (P < .001). While there
was no difference in hospital admissions,
there was a significantly higher number of
emergency department visits in the CPSS
group compared with the no-CPSS group
(0.27 vs. 0.21 visits per patient-year,
P ¼ .007). Additional post-hoc analyses
were completed to identify the most
common primary diagnoses that were asso-
ciated with aberrant visits to the emergency
department (Figure 3). Of the 133 different
primary diagnoses, 27 were determined to be
linked with CPSS comorbidities when
reviewed by the study team.
Discussion
Patients in the CPSS program showed sig-
nificant improvement in disease manage-
ment goals and time to achievement
compared with a patient group who did
not enroll in this program. Patients in the
CPSS program experienced a significant
increase in the rate of all ambulatory
encounters (i.e., visits with primary and
specialty care providers, nurse care man-
agers, and pharmacists), which indicated
greater overall effectiveness with better
coordinated care delivery. Additionally,
patients in the CPSS program showed a
significantly higher rate of visits to the
emergency department compared with
those who did not enroll in this program.
However, on further review, the emergency
services that were rendered did not appear

attributable to the program and the clinical
relevance is unclear. Nonetheless, these
results originated from a population of
patients who had established medical home
practices. This population has previously
demonstrated exceptional baseline medical
therapy and achievement of disease
management targets.15
A large body of evidence supports intensi-
fication of treatment and adherence to the
treatment regimen as significantly leading to
improved control of DM and HBP.20 A lack
of these factors is defined as a failure to either
increase a drug dose or change a drug class.
Findings in our study support previous clin-
ical trials that showed an improvement of
approximately 20% in achievement of clin-
ical targets and a $1600 reduction in health-
care use costs.3 While these studies validate
the results in our study, the IH CPSS
program went beyond what has been previ-
ously reported. This program uniquely
authorized the pharmacist to take account-
ability for a patient's disease management
experience within a medical home practice,
while efficiently coordinating care among the
whole clinical team.
However, even with success of the IH
CPSS program, operational resources to
deliver non-traditional models of ambula-
tory care require substantial investment and
a pay-for-value strategy. In this program,
clinical pharmacists were unable to bill for
the collaborative services that were ren-
dered. The pharmacists' salary was paid
for by institution to test the effectiveness of
this modality for improving adherence to
clinical management goals. Ultimately,
implementing CPSS will be an ongoing
investment where outcomes that provide
value to the health system may need to be
realized over time. If this program is sup-
ported by value-based or capitated reim-
bursement structures, it could represent
decreased healthcare expenses.
With growing patient panels for phys-
icians (average for an IH physician is > 2000
patients), three additional encounters were
needed to further refine clinical disease
targets, as demonstrated in this study to
achieve superior results compared with a
matched control group. Using ancillary
clinical team members to perform CDTM
becomes an operational necessity to provide
access and efficiency in delivering these
services. As healthcare delivery systems
move towards capitated reimbursement
models, investing in collaborative pharmacy
services may reduce the professional salary
cost by as much as half to deliver chronic
disease management. This could result in
major savings to accountable care organiza-
tions and/or capitated systems.21 Further
rigorous economic analyses studying the
financial effects of this program in relation
to other integration improvement activities
were not part of the scope of this study.
However, these analyses are required to
prioritize and support the spread of innov-
ations that provide the most value to cus-
tomers, with the patient and their families
foremost.
Finally, this program had operational
challenges. Further evaluation is ongoing
to study facilitators and barriers to imple-
mentation and patients' reports of their
experience. Similar to the literature, engage-
ment of patients and activation were major
impediments observed by clinical pharma-
cists for obstructing the services that they
rendered.22 Additionally, the cost of treat-
ment (i.e., medications, monitoring tools,
and devices) needed to optimize the disease
management process for patients contrib-
utes to stagnant intensification or poor
adherence. This could potentially lead to
avoidable incident disease and complica-
tions over time.20 Uncertainty still exists
regarding how to finance new mechanisms
of value-based care delivery. Additionally,
determining who is responsible within the
care delivery system to cover the expenses of
the CPSS program still continues to affect
expansion and dissemination. Despite these
244 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
issues, the CPSS program transformed the
practice culture among the intervention
clinics. Physicians and care management
nurses worked in concert with pharmacists
to provide improved and timely care. This
study showed that integrating clinical
pharmacists into established medical home
practices provided additional levels of suc-
cess in managing chronic disease within a
learning healthcare system. The CPSS pro-
gram may be used nationally as demonstra-
tion of a promising practice for improving
adherence to clinical goals.
Limitations
The control group was carefully selected
from an adjacent geographical region that
was not participating in this program to
account for possible selection bias.
However, patients who were enrolled in the
CPSS program may have been more ready to
change than those who did not participate.
Subsequently, there remains a possibility that
PCPs only referred patients that they felt
would participate in CPSS. Unfortunately,
data were not available to measure this
possibility (i.e., through documentation in
the EMR or through measurement of health
literacy, patient activation, or engagement
levels) and should be an area of future study.
Additionally, patients who were enrolled in
CPSS were prescribed proportionally more
medications, presenting a possible selection
bias. However, biometrics (i.e., HbA1c and
blood pressure) were also elevated in this
group of patients, potentially indicating a
more complicated clinical course.
The IH Diabetes Registry does not dis-
tinguish between type 1 or type 2 DM.
Therefore, the study groups may still include
both disease phenotypes within the patient
population. In this study, we
identified > 40,000 patients who were diag-
nosed with DM and/or HBP. However, only
a small proportion of this group was
enrolled because of the pragmatic nature of
this evaluation related to resource and clin-
ical constraints within primary care teams.
We acknowledge that the study population
was largely derived from patients who had
visited a primary care provider within a
large integrated healthcare system and may
not be generalizable to populations outside
of IH. Data that include social determinants
of health (income and education level,
number of family members or dependents,
and the contextual elements of the neigh-
borhood or geographical location where the
patient lives) are predictive of outcomes in
control of disease management; however,
these data were not available for this
study. The level of satisfaction with the
program, patient activation and/or
engagement were not measured and sec-
ondary data collection was not available
for analysis. Additionally, the exact mode
of the pharmacist's interaction was not
differentiated in the medical record (i.e.,
interaction via face-to-face visits, tele-
phone visits, or secure electronic messa-
ging) and thus this information was not
available for study. Iteration on data
collection processes is planned to allow
for future understanding on the best
method of delivering the intervention.
Conclusions
Integrating clinical pharmacists to function
in collaboration with established care teams
for direct management of chronic diseases
using CDTM is proposed. This could opti-
mize operational utility, promote evidence-
based change within a learning healthcare
system, and demonstrate improved adher-
ence to clinical goals. Furthermore, this
study highlights the promise of improving
the efficiency of care teams, while reducing
the burden of disease management, which is
traditionally exclusively attributed to
physicians.
