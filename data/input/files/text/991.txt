A community-based survey was conducted during 1995­1997 of factors related to menopausal and other
symptoms in a multi-racial/ethnic sample of 16,065 women aged 40­55 years. Each of seven sites comprising
the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN) surveyed one of four minority populations and a
Caucasian population. The largest adjusted prevalence odds ratios for all symptoms, particularly hot flashes or
night sweats (odds ratios = 2.06­4.32), were for women who were peri- or postmenopausal. Most symptoms
were reported least frequently by Japanese and Chinese (odds ratios = 0.47­0.67 compared with Caucasian)
women. African-American women reported vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness more (odds ratios =
1.17­1.63) but urine leakage and difficulty sleeping less (odds ratios = 0.64­0.72) than Caucasians. Hispanic
women reported urine leakage, vaginal dryness, heart pounding, and forgetfulness more (odds ratios =
1.22­1.85). Hot flashes or night sweats, urine leakage, and stiffness or soreness were associated with a high
body mass index (odds ratios = 1.15­2.18 for women with a body mass index 27 vs. 19­26.9 kg/m2). Most
symptoms were reported most frequently among women who had difficulty paying for basics (odds ratios =
1.15­2.05), who smoked (odds ratios = 1.21­1.78), and who rated themselves less physically active than other
women their age (odds ratios = 1.24­2.33). These results suggest that lifestyle, menstrual status, race/ethnicity,
and socioeconomic status affect symptoms in this age group. Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:463­73.

By the year 2025, the number of postmenopausal women
in the United States is projected to double from the mid-
1990s (1), with half a million women added annually to the
midlife population for the rest of this decade (2). An esti-
mated 3­5 billion dollars will be spent annually by the year
2005 for hormone replacement and physician monitoring
alone (3). However, relatively little is known about the
prevalence of symptoms in women in their fifth and sixth
decades of life, and much of what is known is derived from
studies of White women. Developing preventive strategies
for such women who are undergoing social and physiologic
transition requires understanding multiple factors that affect
symptom reporting in women from different socioeconomic
and racial/ethnic backgrounds.
In the present study, we investigated the relation of
sociodemographic and lifestyle factors to a number of spe-
cific symptoms or conditions in a large, multiethnic, com-
munity-based sample of women from across the United
States who participated in the first phase of the Study of
Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN). We hypothe-
sized that: 1) vasomotor and other estrogen-related symp-
toms would be more frequently associated with factors that
result in decreased production of estrogen, such as surgical
menopause, smoking, reduced body mass, and physical
activity; 2) prevalence of non-estrogen-related symptoms
would increase with age, independent of menopausal status;
and 3) factors resulting in physiologic, economic, or social
stress (lower education, being unmarried, difficulty paying
for basics, and unemployment) would be associated with
increased symptomatology but that the prevalence of spe-
cific symptoms would differ by race/ethnicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The first phase of SWAN consisted of a cross-sectional
survey conducted from 1995 through 1997 of 16,065
women from seven geographic areas in the United States
(Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark, Oakland,
and Pittsburgh). The purpose of the survey was twofold:
1) to screen women for eligibility for enrollment into a longi-
464 Gold et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 5, 2000
tudinal study of premenopausal women and 2) to investigate
cross-sectional relations of a limited number of risk factors
and health outcomes. Each site screened one minority pop-
ulation (African Americans in Pittsburgh, Boston, the
Detroit area, and Chicago; Japanese in Los Angeles;
Chinese in the Oakland area of California; and Hispanics in
New Jersey) in addition to a Caucasian population.
Community-based sampling, using established lists of pop-
ulations at five sites and random digit dialing combined with
a "snowball" approach at two sites (4) (those with the
Hispanic and Japanese minority samples), was used to sam-
ple women aged 40­55 years, who resided in the area sur-
rounding each clinical site. In the snowball technique,
women first identified by a list-based or random digit dial-
ing technique were asked for the names and contact infor-
mation of other women who would meet the eligibility cri-
teria, and these women in turn were contacted, screened for
eligibility, and asked for the names of other appropriate
women. This process continued until a sufficient number of
eligible women was identified. Women were included who
spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Japanese at the
respective sites where these languages were used and who
identified themselves as Caucasian, African American,
Hispanic, Japanese, or Chinese, depending on the site-
specific population screened.
Data collection
Ascertainment of symptoms. Since the cross-sectional
survey had to be brief, the presence of vasomotor, psycho-
logic, and physical symptoms during the previous 2 weeks was
determined from self-reported (yes/no) responses to closed-
ended questions. Most interviews were computer-assisted tele-
phone interviews, with about half being in-person at two sites.
The specific symptoms included were based primarily on pre-
vious epidemiologic work on Caucasian women (5­7) and
included the following: difficulty sleeping, night sweats,
headaches, hot flushes or flashes, forgetfulness, vaginal dry-
ness, leaking urine, feeling tense or nervous, feeling blue or
depressed, and irritability or grouchiness. In addition, symp-
toms such as stiffness or soreness in joints, neck, or shoulders
and heart pounding or racing were included, based on previous
anthropologic work in the different race/ethnic groups (8, 9).
Symptoms thought to be associated with menopause, such as
hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness, were inter-
spersed with other symptoms to minimize bias from stereo-
typic thinking about menopause (10). The relation of demo-
graphic and lifestyle variables to the psychologic symptoms is
addressed elsewhere (L. H. Powell et al., Rush Presbyterian-
St. Luke's Medical Center, unpublished manuscript), while the
relations to physical symptoms are addressed here.
Assessment of independent variables. Independent vari-
ables of interest were self-reported current status related to
demographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, educational attain-
ment, employment, marital status, number of children, and
ability to pay for basics), lifestyle factors (smoking, physical
activity), height and weight, and menopausal status.
Race/ethnicity was self-defined as Black or African
American, non-Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese or Chinese
American, Japanese or Japanese American, or Hispanic
(Central American, Cuban or Cuban American, Dominican,
Mexican or Mexican American, Puerto Rican, South
American or Spanish, or other Hispanic). In addition,
respondents could specify a race/ethnicity other than the
defined categories or indicate "mixed" or no primary affili-
ation. Since most extant literature is based on non-Hispanic
Caucasians, this was the reference group. Questions about
smoking were modified from those of the American
Thoracic Society (11). Physical activity was assessed with
one question about activity level relative to other women of
the respondent's age. The body mass index was calculated
from self-reported height and weight and equals weight
(kg)/height (m)2.
Menopausal status was based on menstrual characteristics
as: surgical, indicating menses had stopped as a result of hys-
terectomy and/or oophorectomy (thus not necessarily repre-
senting cessation of hormonal cycling); postmenopausal,
indicating menses had stopped for at least 12 months without
surgery; late perimenopausal, indicating menses had
occurred in the past 12 months but not in the last 3 months;
early perimenopausal, indicating menses had occurred in the
past 3 months but had become less predictable; and pre-
menopausal, indicating menses had occurred in the past 3
months with no decrease in predictability. Women whose
menstrual periods had stopped because of medication, radio-
therapy, pregnancy or lactation, or extreme weight change
(n  311), who reported use of exogenous female hormones
in the past 3 months (since such use might reflect greater
symptom prevalence or reduced symptom reporting and thus
be uninterpretable, n  1,635), or who reported their
race/ethnicity as mixed/other (since this was a very non-
homogeneous group, n  1,694) were excluded, for a total of
12,425 included in the present analyses.
Data analyses
Crude prevalence odds ratios for the association between
the selected characteristics and each symptom were com-
puted. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust preva-
lence odds ratios simultaneously for site and demographic,
lifestyle, and reproductive characteristics (12). As a result of
factor analyses (13), we combined hot flashes and night
sweats into one outcome variable of hot flashes and/or night
sweats. The odds ratios for the symptoms "difficulty sleep-
ing," "forgetful," and "heart pounding or racing" were also
adjusted for reporting irritability, feeling tense, or feeling
anxious or depressed. Initial exploratory adjustment for
diagnosis or treatment of arthritis was made for the symp-
tom "stiffness or soreness in joints, neck, or shoulders," but
this did not modify the results. Exploratory adjustment for
language in which the interview was conducted, as an indi-
cator of acculturation, also did not modify the results.
Parity was treated as a continuous variable. Four-year age
groups and body mass index (14) were treated as categorical
variables, since they were not linearly related to the preva-
lence of most of the symptoms. All categorical variables
were treated as dummy variables in the logistic regression,
thus assuming no particular ordering. Goodness-of-fit of

models was tested by the Hosmer and Lemeshow procedure
(15). Because sites were not randomly selected and because
sampling procedures varied by site to accommodate the dif-
ficulties in attaining adequate numbers of each racial/ethnic
minority (i.e., formal representative sampling procedures
were not exclusively used at two sites), use of estimation
procedures based on formal sampling methods was inappro-
priate. The variance estimates used in the confidence inter-
vals shown here were thus based on simple random sam-
pling, but they should be interpreted with caution for these
reasons.
Interactions of race/ethnicity or menstrual status with the
association of each factor and symptom were first examined
by stratifying on race/ethnicity or menstrual status to deter-
mine if the stratum-specific natural logarithms of the odds
ratios differed from each other or from the unstratified nat-
ural logarithm odds ratio by more than two times the stan-
dard error for the unstratified effect. If so, the statistical sig-
nificance of interaction terms was examined in the multiple
logistic regression model.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population
Age distributions were generally similar by race/ethnic
group, although a higher proportion of Chinese women
were aged 40­43 years and a lower proportion were aged
52­55 years compared with other race/ethnic groups (table
1). Most women were premenopausal or in the early peri-
menopause; the proportion of women who had had surgi-
cal menopause was higher in African Americans, and the
proportion who were postmenopausal was higher in
Hispanics than in other race/ethnic groups. Hispanics had
the lowest and Caucasians the highest educational attain-
ment, while Japanese and Chinese women reported the
least difficulty paying for basics. African-American and
Hispanic women had higher parity, and African Americans
had higher body mass index than did women in the other
race/ethnic groups. Smoking rates were lower in Japanese
and Chinese women. The perception of amount of physical

activity compared with other women of the same age did
not differ greatly by race/ethnic group.
Unadjusted relation of sociodemographic, health, and
lifestyle factors to symptom prevalence
Increased age, lower educational level, difficulty paying
for basics, race/ethnicity, increased parity, and employ-
ment were related to the prevalence of most symptoms
(table 2). Virtually all symptoms, except stiffness and
soreness in joints, neck, and shoulders, were less fre-
quently reported in Japanese and Chinese women, while
vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes or night sweats) were
most frequently reported by African-American or Hispanic
women. Urine leakage, vaginal dryness, and heart pound-
ing or racing were more frequently reported by Hispanic
women. The prevalence of most symptoms varied by site,
thus warranting inclusion of site in multivariate logistic
regression analyses.
Vasomotor symptoms were much more frequently
reported by women in the late perimenopause or by women
who were surgically or naturally postmenopausal compared
with premenopausal women (table 2). Most other symptoms
were also more frequent in women who were peri- or post-
menopausal, but the differences were not as large. Prior to
adjustment for other covariates, the prevalences of hot
flashes or night sweats increased with age in most menstrual
status categories, except for postmenopausal women in
whom it declined (data not shown). However, the preva-
lence of most symptoms varied more by menstrual status
than by age. Heart pounding or racing and difficulty sleep-
ing were not independently related to age (data not shown).
Reporting of all other symptoms increased with age,
although not in a monotonic trend. Current smoking, engag-
ing in less physical activity than other women of the same
age, and increased body mass index were associated with
increased prevalence of almost every symptom, although
the trends were not monotonic.
Multivariate adjusted associations of risk factors to
symptoms
Age. After adjustment for the other covariates in table
1, vasomotor symptoms and urine leakage were not related

to age in postmenopausal and late perimenopausal women
(data not shown).
Menstrual status. Menstrual status had the largest
adjusted prevalence odds ratios of any risk factor for most
symptoms, particularly vasomotor (table 3). All symptoms
were more frequent in women who were not pre-
menopausal. Vasomotor symptoms were particularly fre-
quent in women who were in the late perimenopause,
although the numbers in this category were relatively small.
Sociodemographic factors. Adjusted prevalence odds
ratios for vasomotor symptoms and heart pounding or rac-
ing generally increased with decreasing level of educational
attainment (table 3). The prevalences of vaginal dryness
and forgetfulness were elevated only in women with less
than a high school education. All symptoms were increased
in women who reported difficulty paying for basics, and
prevalence increased with greater difficulty. Heart pound-
ing or racing, forgetfulness, and difficulty sleeping
increased in women who were not employed full time.
Vasomotor symptoms, urine leakage, and vaginal dryness
were reported less frequently among never married, wid-
owed, or divorced than currently married women (data not
shown).
Race/ethnicity. All symptoms, except heart pounding
and forgetfulness, were reported less frequently by Japanese
and Chinese women compared with non-Hispanic
Caucasians. This finding persisted after adjustment for lan-
guage as a measure of acculturation (data not shown). Urine
leakage and difficulty sleeping were reported significantly
less often, but vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness
were reported significantly more frequently by African-
American than by Caucasian women. Hispanic women
reported urine leakage, vaginal dryness, heart pounding or
racing, and forgetfulness more frequently than did non-
Hispanic Caucasian women. All minority ethnic groups
reported difficulty sleeping significantly less frequently than
did Caucasians after adjusting for other covariates. No
marked interaction of race/ethnicity with prevalence odds
ratios for risk factors and symptoms was observed.
Body mass index. Hot flashes or night sweats, urine
leakage, and stiffness or soreness in joints, neck, or shoul-
ders were reported more frequently in women with a body
mass index of 27 kg/m2 or greater compared with women
with a body mass index of 19­26.9 kg/m2 (or less). This
relation was particularly marked for urine leakage, for
which prevalence increased more than twofold for women
with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2 or greater. However,
hot flashes or night sweats were not associated with an
increased body mass index in postmenopausal and late peri-
menopausal women (data not shown).
Smoking. Past smoking and current smoking were
related to prevalence of most symptoms, except vaginal
dryness and forgetfulness (the latter being positively related
only to past smoking). No clear trends with amount cur-
rently smoked were observed.
Physical activity. All symptoms (particularly stiffness
or soreness, heart pounding or racing, forgetfulness, and
difficulty sleeping) were more frequent among women who
reported getting less physical activity compared with

Socioeconomic status
In the present study, lower educational attainment and
greater difficulty paying for basics were related to increased
symptom prevalence. In addition, lack of full-time employ-
ment was associated with heart pounding or racing, forget-
fulness, and difficulty sleeping. These findings are consis-
tent with those of a number of others (16, 24, 34, 35).
Race/ethnicity
The prevalence of vasomotor symptoms in developed
countries in largely Caucasian populations has previously
been examined in cross-sectional (22, 25, 32, 33, 36) and
prospective (20, 21) studies, with considerable variability
in results. The finding in the present study that more
African-American women reported hot flashes or night
sweats than Caucasian women (37 percent vs. 24 percent)
is of interest. In a study of Caucasian and African-
American women from a population-based study of repro-
ductive cancers, 71 percent of participants reported experi-
encing hot flashes at menopause, with no racial differences
in prevalence (34). Our finding of increased reporting of
vaginal dryness in African-American women also differs
from recent unadjusted findings by Wilbur et al. (16),
which also indicate an increased risk of urine leakage in
African-American women, while we found a reduced
prevalence of this symptom in this group compared with
Caucasians. Also of interest in the present study, Hispanic
women reported the highest prevalence of vaginal dryness.
Asian women (9, 36­39) report fewer hot flashes than do
Caucasian women. Because of simultaneous adjustment of
multiple variables in the present study, differences among
race/ethnic groups in these other variables (e.g., body mass
index or smoking) do not account for differences in symp-
tom reporting among the groups.
Body mass index
In the present study, women with a body mass index of at
least 32 kg/m2 had a greater prevalence of hot flashes or
night sweats (43.8 percent) than did those having a body
mass index of less than 19 kg/m2 (30.6 percent). A higher
body mass index has been associated with increased symp-
tom reporting during the menopausal transition in one study
(40) and with fewer hot flashes in other studies (34, 41, 42).
Since adrenal androgens are converted to estrogen in adi-
pose tissue (43), and since vasomotor symptoms are thought
to be related to reduced estrogen levels, a lower prevalence
of vasomotor symptoms is expected in heavier women. The
reasons for the present findings are unclear. Possibly the rate
(and steepness) of the decline in or the widely fluctuating
levels of estradiol (44) may affect symptoms more than
absolute levels (which would be associated with body
weight). Differences in study design (cross-sectional vs.
prospective), sample size, methods in ascertaining body
mass index (self-report vs. direct measurement), and simul-
taneous control of covariates (especially smoking) may also
account for discrepant findings.
women who reported getting much more or somewhat more
physical activity than women of the same age. A trend
appeared of increasing prevalence of these symptoms with
decreasing physical activity.
DISCUSSION
The present SWAN cross-sectional study is one of the
largest multiethnic studies of demographic and lifestyle fac-
tors associated with symptom reporting in midlife women,
and the findings have potentially important preventive impli-
cations. We found significant independent effects of age, edu-
cational level, difficulty paying for basics, race/ethnicity,
body mass, smoking, physical activity, and menstrual status
on the prevalence of vasomotor and other physical symptoms.
Despite the use of quite varied methodologies, in
numerous cross-sectional studies of clinical, psychoso-
cial, and sociodemographic factors associated with the
menopausal transition in Caucasian women, a few major
findings have emerged. First, vasomotor symptoms, such
as hot flashes or flushes and night sweats, are unequivo-
cally linked to hormonal changes (16­18). Longitudinal
studies have largely confirmed the relation between vaso-
motor symptoms and the climacteric (6, 18­21), and
reports of vasomotor symptoms at peri- or postmenopause
have been found to be inversely related to the level of
serum estrogens (6, 16). Menopause and reduction in
endogenous estrogen levels result in atrophic changes of
epithelial tissues including the skin and vaginal wall (22).
Other symptoms, such as sleep difficulties, are less con-
sistently associated with menopausal status (23­27).
Further, a subset of women with low socioeconomic sta-
tus who experience difficulties with personal and social
functioning during the climacteric may report more
symptoms (17).
Menstrual status and age
The results from our study indicate that over half of late
perimenopausal women report hot flashes or night sweats.
This estimate is in agreement with other studies showing
that the occurrence of hot flashes increases with irregular-
ity in menses, peaking at 50 percent just prior to
menopause, and later declining in the postmenopause
(28). The prevalence of hot flashes in perimenopausal
women of Anglo-European origin is reported to be 50­85
percent (25, 27).
The prevalence of vaginal dryness in the present study
was 13.1 percent, in agreement with several studies
(29­32). However, in a cross-sectional study of 5,990
Swedish women, aged 46­62 years, the prevalence of vagi-
nal dryness was 21 percent, with prevalence increasing with
age to about 34 percent in 62-year-old women (33). Wilbur
et al. (16) noted a higher prevalence (29 percent in women
aged 35­69 years), with the wider age range than our pop-
ulation possibly accounting for the higher prevalence.
Another limitation of previous work, however, is using age
as a surrogate for menstrual status, whereas the present
study used reported bleeding patterns.
Correlates of Symptoms in Midlife Women 471
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 5, 2000
Smoking
Past smoking and current smoking were positively associ-
ated in the present study with prevalence of vasomotor symp-
toms, in agreement with most but not all (34) others (45­48).
Women who smoke would be expected to have a higher
prevalence of vasomotor symptoms because of the antiestro-
genic effects of smoking (49­51); however, the lack of asso-
ciation of smoking with vaginal dryness is thus unexpected,
suggesting that other factors may be more important in the
occurrence of vaginal dryness. We did observe that vaginal
dryness was significantly less often reported among never
married, widowed, or divorced women compared with mar-
ried women, suggesting that opportunity for sexual activity
may be related to reporting of vaginal dryness.
Physical activity
In contrast to the present study, previous cross-sectional
surveys have generally failed to find any association between
physical activity and vasomotor symptoms (46, 52­55). One
study reported a lower prevalence of hot flashes among regu-
larly active perimenopausal women compared with popula-
tion controls whose activity level was not determined (30).
The inconsistency between the present findings and those of
previous investigations may be due, in part, to the assessment
method. The present study asked about the respondent's per-
ception of activity level but not what she actually did. This
may predispose women who are having more symptoms to
perceive themselves as less active than their peers.
Alternatively, previous studies, with more limited sample
sizes, may not have had the statistical power of the present
study to detect significant relations between activity and vaso-
motor symptoms. Most cross-sectional surveys have observed
fewer somatic symptoms (52) and better health status (53, 55)
in active women compared with sedentary women. Given the
cross-sectional design of all of these studies, it is not possible
to determine whether women feel better because they are
active or are less active because they are symptomatic.
Limitations of the present study
The present study was cross-sectional. Thus, for certain
variables, such as body mass index and physical activity, we
could not be certain that the factor actually preceded and
thus predisposed to the occurrence of symptoms. However,
a number of the factors (e.g., education, parity, and smok-
ing) were unlikely to have changed recently for most
women and thus were likely to have preceded symptom
reporting. Nonetheless, the temporal sequence of these asso-
ciations will be better established in the next phase of
SWAN, the longitudinal study.
Another limitation is self-reporting, particularly of symp-
toms, body mass index, and menstrual status. The use of
standard questions for these items enhances the comparabil-
ity of these results with those of prior studies. Again, how-
ever, these assessments will be improved in longitudinal
assessment and correlation with biologic measures of
endocrine status in the next phase of SWAN.
A third limitation is the varied sampling methods used
among sites, necessitated by difficulties in achieving needed
sample size of minority populations, making use of formal
estimation procedures inappropriate. Thus, the present con-
fidence intervals should be interpreted with caution.
A final limitation is the potential for inadequate detail on
variables of interest and inadequate control of potential con-
founding factors. In this limited interview, it was not possi-
ble to examine all such potential factors. In particular, more
detailed questions could not be asked about both symptoms
(e.g., nature of headaches and difficulty with sleep) and
additional risk factors, such as diet, nature of occupation,
income, pack-years of smoking, and nature and intensity of
physical activity. Thus, uncontrolled confounding and insuf-
ficient detail are potential limitations that will be better
addressed in the SWAN longitudinal study.
Strengths of the present study
This is the first study to have large numbers of women at
various stages of the menopausal transition and from five
race/ethnic groups. Women were selected to be generally rep-
resentative of their racial/ethnic group in their geographic area
and came from several geographic areas in the United States.
Thus, these results should apply to a large segment of women
in this age group in this country. In addition, the use of stan-
dardized methods of data collection over several geographic
areas is an important strength. Finally, the effects of each vari-
able were examined while controlling for many others.
Conclusions
The results of the SWAN cross-sectional survey indicate
that a number of potentially modifiable factors affect symp-
tom reporting. Thus, for women for whom medical treatment
is contraindicated, undesired, or not tolerated, alternatives
may be offered in lifestyle changes. In particular, smoking
cessation was associated with lower prevalence than in cur-
rent smokers of vasomotor symptoms and difficulty sleep-
ing. Increased physical activity was associated with lower
prevalence of virtually all symptoms. Overweight was asso-
ciated with hot flashes/night sweats, urine leakage, and stiff-
ness or soreness. All of these factors are, of course, also
associated with a number of other adverse health effects.
Our results also provide guidance to health care providers in
assessing symptoms by increasing their sensitivity to differ-
ences in symptom-reporting patterns by race/ethnicity and
menstrual status. Importantly, our results also show that
most indicators of low socioeconomic status, particularly
low educational level and difficulty paying for basics, were
associated with significantly increased reporting of almost
all symptoms.
