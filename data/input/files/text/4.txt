 MINIMUM WAGES AND POVERTY

 JOHN T. ADDISON and McKINLEYL. BLACKBURN*

 The principal justification for minimum wage legislation has been
 the claim that it would improve the economic condition of low-wage
 workers. Most previous analyses of the distributional effects of mini-
 mum wages have been based on simulation exercises employing restric-
 tive assumptions that guarantee the conclusion that an increase in the
 minimum wage reduces poverty. In contrast, the authors of this paper
 adopt a more flexible "reduced-form" approach that links increases in
 both federal and state minima to contemporaneous changes in poverty
 rates. For the period 1983-96, they find indications of a poverty-
 reducing effect of minimum wages among teenagers and older junior
 high school dropouts.

 upporters of minimum wage laws gener-
 ally argue that minimum wages improve
 the economic lot of low-wage workers. How-
 ever, if increases in the minimum wage lead
 to reduced employment among this group,
 the effects on poverty and other aspects of
 the distribution are ambiguous. Econo-
 mists who have examined these effects have
 primarily relied on simulation exercises that
 hinge importantly on a number of simpli-
 fied and even contentious assumptions,
 such as those having to do with
 disemployment effects and family labor
 supply responses. We follow an alternative,
 reduced-form approach that, in correlat-
 ing changes in federal and state minima
 with corresponding movements in (several

 measures of) the family income distribu-
 tion, avoids these problems.

 Our analysis uses state-level data for the
 years 1983-96, for three groups most likely
 to be affected by minimum wage mandates:
 teenagers, young adults, and junior high
 school dropouts. We focus primarily on the
 poverty rates of these groups, but also offer
 a parallel analysis of the association be-
 tween minimum wages and average earn-
 ings, and between minimum wages and
 weeks worked.

 ployment effect implies that the impact of
 minimum wage increases on the distribu-
 tion of earnings for low-wage workers is
 uncertain. Some workers may gain and
 others lose, implying that the benefits of
 the minimum wage increase are not distrib-
 uted evenly across low-wage workers. More-
 over, it is not clear that low-wage workers
 would gain in an expected earnings sense,
 because the impact on average earnings
 depends on the scale of the displacement
 effect, as well as labor supply elasticities in
 the uncovered sector (see Gramlich 1976).
 Only in the absence of disemploy-ment ef-
 fects are the implications more transpar-
 ent, since every low-wage worker should
 gain in this case.

 It is the joint presence of losers and
 gainers from minimum wage increases that
 contributes to a similar theoretical ambigu-
 ity regarding the consequences of mini-
 mum wages for the family income distribu-
 tion. Moreover, discussions of family ef-
 fects are complicated by a number of other
 considerations that do not arise when the
 focus is simply on earnings.

 First, changes in the minimum wage may
 affect the labor supply of other members of
 the families of workers directly affected by
 the minimum wage. Since such effects
 involve both income and cross-substitution
 effects, these responses become difficult to
 predict. Second, the effects of minimum
 wage increases will also depend heavily on
 the initial family income position of work-
 ers whose earnings are increased by the
 change, since such workers are not neces-
 sarily concentrated at the low end of the
 family income distribution. Third, there is
 little guidance from theory to help us iden-
 tify the position in the family income distri-
 bution of those workers who might lose
 jobs when the minimum wage is increased.
 In particular, an important question in
 determining the distributional effects is
 whetherjob losses are concentrated among
 families at either the low or high end of the
 distribution. And, finally, both losers and
 winners from the minimum wage increase
 may change their living arrangements as a
 result of their changed earnings. Even if
 there were no disemployment effects, these

 complications lead to ambiguous theoreti-
 cal predictions for the effects of minimum
 wage increases when attention shifts from
 earnings to the family income distribution.
 Given the lack of clear theoretical pre-
 dictions as to how a rise in the minimum
 wage affects the distribution of family in-
 comes, the extant empirical work has at-
 tempted to provide answers by simulating
 the effect of actual or hypothetical man-
 dates on an existing distribution. The out-
 come measures used in these exercises have
 included poverty rates (or gaps), the in-
 come-to-needs ratio, and quintile or decile
 shares.

 The simulation exercises generally allow
 for both disemployment effects and incom-
 plete coverage. Disemployment effects are
 calculated using a range of elasticities sug-
 gested by estimates from time-series stud-
 ies. One problem with this procedure is
 that these time-series studies typically re-
 port elasticities that indicate how minimum
 wages affect the employment of all teenag-
 ers, or young adults, and not just those
 workers with wages directly affected by the
 minimum wage increase. Applying these
 same elasticities directly to a group of mini-
 mum wage workers thus inevitably under-
 states the implied disemployment effect
 from the time-series estimate. Furthermore,
 the simulation studies by Horrigan and
 Mincy (1993), Johnson and Browning
 (1983), and Mincy (1990) appear to as-
 sume that the disemployment effect is a
 proportion of initial hours worked for each
 affected worker, so that all workers share in
 the disemployment effect.2 Because the
 elasticities used in these studies never ex-
 ceed unity, this assumption ensures that
 every low-wage worker will gain from the
 simulated minimum increase.

 2The proportion is a function of the size of each
 worker's wage change resulting from the minimum
 wage increase.

 3Johnson and Browning (1983) provided one set
 of results in which the elasticity of demand was set
 equal to one. Also, the poverty simulations in Mincy
 do allow some families who are nonpoor before the
 minimum wage increase to fall below the poverty line
 because of a loss of employment; at the same time,

 Simulation studies must also make some
 assumption about minimum wage effects
 on workers initially working below the cur-
 rent minimum. Most studies first assume
 that these workers would be raised to the
 new minimum and then, for the partial
 coverage case, repeat the exercise assum-
 ing that they are unaffected by the change
 (see Burkhauser and Finegan 1989; Mincy
 1990; Horrigan and Mincy 1993). The
 exception isJohnson and Browning (1983),
 who increased the wages of workers cur-
 rently below the minimum by the same
 proportion as the increase in the minimum
 wage. As for workers earning between the
 old and new minima, the simulations as-
 sume that their wages are increased to the
 new minimum.

 Previous studies of the effects of mini-
 mum wages on poverty have found that
 minimum wages reduce poverty, with simu-
 lated effects that appear to be somewhat
 strong. Thus, Burkhauser and Finegan
 (1989), who did not allow for disemploy-
 ment effects, found that a 24% increase in
 the minimum wage in 1984 would reduce
 the share of covered low-wage workers in
 poverty by 21% (reducing poverty from
 14% to 11 % for these workers). That said,
 they also reported that less than 12% of the
 increase in incomes stemming from the
 hike in the minimum wage would accrue to
 poor families, while 39% would go to fami-
 lies with incomes at least three times the
 poverty line. Mincy (1990), who simulated
 the impact of a 27% increase in the mini-
 mum wage applied to the 1987 income
 distribution, obtained what appears to be a
 bigger poverty-reducing effect. Specifically,
 he found that the number of poor fami-
 lies-among all families, notjust those with
 a low-wage worker-would fall by 6% in the
 partial coverage case and 9% in the full
 coverage case.4 These magnitudes are,

 however, quite sensitive to the choice of the
 elasticity of demand for adult minimum-
 wage workers.

 Simulations that consider the impact of
 minimum wages on the inequality of family
 incomes point to very modest effects. In a
 study that is notable for its attempt to ac-
 commodate accompanying changes in tax
 and transfer paymentsJohnson and Brown-
 ing (1983) found that a hypothetical 22%
 increase in the minimum wage in 1976
 would have had essentially no effect on the
 Gini coefficient for family incomes. Simi-
 larly, while Horrigan and Mincy's (1992)
 simulations based on a $4.71 minimum wage
 in 1987 pointed to a modest decline in
 earnings inequality, the percentage of fam-
 ily income held by each quintile of families
 was virtually unaffected.

 The consensus view of prior simulation
 studies would appear to be that minimum
 wages reduce poverty, but primarily by in-
 creasing, however slightly, incomes
 throughout the distribution. The explana-
 tion for this result is that low-wage workers
 are distributed rather evenly across the fam-
 ily income distribution. Nevertheless, there
 are several simplifying assumptions implicit
 in these simulations that may be very im-
 portant to their outcomes. The findings
 may be the product of the particular as-
 sumptions regarding the magnitude and
 incidence of displacement effects. There
 are also complications arising from assump-
 tions about the coverage of the minimum
 increase for workers initially below the cur-
 rent minimum. These studies also ignore
 issues raised by possible changes in labor
 supply of other family members, and by
 possible changes in the family unit.

 The only direct empirical study of mini-
 mum wage effects on the poverty rate is that
 contained in Card and Krueger's Myth and
 Measurement: The New Economics of the Mini-

 however, he also assumed that every ex ante poor
 family would experience an income increase if one of
 its members was affected by the minimum wage in-
 crease.

 4These are average effects from five simulations
 using published estimates of teenager and adult

 disemployment effects. On Burkhauser and Finegan's
 definition, low-wage workers represent approximately
 15% of the labor force. If a similar percentage of
 families have low-wage workers, then more families
 will be removed from poverty according to Mincy's
 findings than according to Burkhauser and Finegan 's.

 mum Wage (1995). They regressed the
 change in a state's poverty rate from 1989
 to 1991 on the fraction of the state's labor
 force (in 1989) that should have been af-
 fected by the federal minimum wage in-
 creases in 1990 and 1991, that is, the frac-
 tion in 1989 below the level of the 1991
 minimum wage. Their results vary across
 specifications but always provide a negative
 coefficient estimate, suggesting that when
 more workers are affected, poverty rates
 are more likely to fall. However, their
 results for the overall poverty rate are small
 and statistically insignificant. They also
 estimated separate regressions in which the
 poverty rate for workers only was the de-
 pendent variable, and found somewhat
 stronger effects, but this approach fails to
 capture the impact of any disemployment
 effects of minimum wages. Despite the
 weak nature of their statistical evidence,
 Card and Krueger concluded that their
 analysis "points to a modest poverty-re-
 ducing effect of the minimum wage" (p.
 307).

 Unlike simulation treatments, our ap-
 proach relaxes the need to build a restric-
 tive and perhaps unrealistic model in as-
 sessing minimum wage effects on poverty.
 We instead correlate actual changes in pov-
 erty (and other distributional measures)
 with actual changes in the minimum wage.
 Taking a cue from the literature on em-
 ployment effects of minimum wages, we
 estimate our models by focusing on par-
 ticular groups of workers considered most
 likely to be affected by minimum wage laws.
 Our approach differs from the regression
 analysis of Card and Krueger (1995) in two
 main ways: first, we focus on the effects
 among families with low-wage workers,
 rather than for all families (where the ef-
 fect, if any, is likely to be very small); and,
 second, we consider a much longer time
 frame than their two-year interval.

 (1 E t = Pl toV) P2- + Ftl

 where E is the employment (or unemploy-
 ment) rate of the affected group, f(Mt) is
 some function of the prevailing minimum
 wage, and Xis a vector of variables intended
 to capture other influences on the demand
 for low-wage workers (see the survey in
 Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen 1982). Most of
 these studies have employed monthly time-
 series data on the labor force activity of
 teenagers and young adults, though a re-
 cent study by Neumark and Wascher (1992)
 used cross-section, time-series data com-
 prising state-level observations for the 1973-
 89 period.

 As we are interested in the effects of
 minimum wages on the income distribu-
 tion, we could also estimate time-series
 models in which the dependent variable is
 some characteristic of the income distribu-
 tion for low-wage workers. Data on the
 family income distribution are available only
 on an annual basis, however, leaving a fairly
 small sample to use for such estimations.
 Therefore we chose instead to create a
 panel of state-level observations for the
 1983-96 period.5 These panel data include
 measures of poverty and upper-income sta-
 tus for particular groups of individuals in
 each state (plus the District of Columbia).
 The base sources for our measures are the
 March Current Population Surveys (CPS)
 for 1984-97, which contain information on
 individual and family income from the pre-
 vious calendar year.6 The CPS data also
 contain the poverty line for each family,
 which we use in constructing our key mea-
 sure: the percentage of individuals whose
 families have income below the family's
 poverty line. Inevitably, there is some arbi-
 trariness in the definition of the official
 poverty lines, and so we also estimate mod-
 els in which the poverty rates are calculated

 using new poverty lines that are 1.25 times
 the official poverty cutoffs.

 We calculated poverty rates for three
 groups whose income position we consider
 most likely to be affected by changes in the
 minimum wage. The first two groups are
 defined on the basis of age: all individuals
 between the ages of 16 and 19 ("teenag-
 ers"), and all individuals aged 20 to 24
 ("young adults"). Haugen and Mellor
 (1990) found that roughly 60% of mini-
 mum wage workers fell into these two cat-
 egories. We also identify a group of indi-
 viduals we call "junior high dropouts"-
 those above the age of 24 but with nine or
 fewer years of completed schooling-be-
 cause these workers are also likely to be
 involved in low-wage labor markets.7 Pov-
 erty rates were also calculated for the group
 of prime-age individuals (those aged 25-
 54).

 For each of our three groups, we esti-
 mate several models in which the group's
 poverty rate is the dependent variable.
 Denoting this poverty rate by Ps for state s
 in year t, our models are of the form

 where o and y represent state-specific and
 year-specific intercepts. These equations
 are estimated as fixed-effects models. The
 year effects should pick up any nationwide
 recessionary effects on the distributional
 measure (their inclusion also frees us from
 having to choose a price index to express
 the minimum wage variable in constant
 dollars), while the state effects should con-
 trol for any tendency for some states to
 provide better labor market opportunities
 for low-wage workers than other states do,
 as well as differences between states in the
 generosity of AFDC benefits, UI replace-
 ment rates, and so on.8 The vector Xcon-

 7Addison and Blackburn (1993) found that, in
 1992, 44% of teenagers, 19% of young adults, and
 24% ofjunior high dropouts were paid at or below the
 minimum wage (among those with jobs). Only 12%
 of all individuals were paid at or below the minimum.
 8The state effects also control for any tendency for
 state price levels to differ on average from the na-
 tional price level.

 sists of characteristics of the dependent-
 variable group (specifically, average age,
 percent white non-hispanic, and percent
 hispanic).

 Given that there may be differential busi-
 ness cycle effects across states, we also esti-
 mate specifications that include state- and
 year-specific independent variables that
 measure state-specific cycle effects. In these
 specifications, one cyclical control that we
 use is the poverty rate of prime-age indi-
 viduals. Our reasoning for this approach
 rests on the argument that the prime-age
 part of the population is unlikely to be
 directly affected to any great degree by
 changes in the minimum wage, so that the
 prime-age measure should largely reflect
 how the cycle in that state and that year
 affects the outcome indicator. We will also
 use the prime-age unemployment rate as
 an alternative cyclical control.

 If the only minimum wage law were fed-
 eral legislation, our suggested model could
 not be estimated, because the minimum
 wage variable would be a linear function of
 the year dummies. Minimum wages are not
 the same across states, however, as some
 states set wage floors that are higher than
 the federal standard. It is this variation in
 the minimum wage variable that allows us
 to identify a minimum wage effect. Specifi-
 cally, the identification of the minimum
 wage effect is achieved through a combina-
 tion of increases in the minimum wage for
 higher-income states as their state minima
 are raised, and increases for lower-income
 states as the federal minimum was subse-
 quently increased. Following Card, Katz,
 and Krueger (1994), we enter the "prevail-
 ing" minimum wage-the state or federal
 minimum, whichever is higher-in loga-
 rithmic form, rather than the coverage-
 adjusted relative minimum wage variable
 (the "Kaitz index") that is used in studies of
 minimum wage effects on employment.9

 9Card, Katz, and Krueger (1994) criticized the
 relative minimum wage variable because it tends to be
 negatively correlated with the average wage of teenag-
 ers. They found virtually no evidence of disemploy-
 ment effects when the logarithm of the minimum

 aIf the minimum wage changed in the middle of the year, the minimum wage was calculated as a weighted
 average of the old and new minima, with weights equal to the percentage of the year in which the relevant
 minimum was in effect. Blank entries imply that the prevailing minimum in that state and year was the same as
 the federal minimum. Data on state minima were obtained from January issues of the Monthly Labor Review.

 bUntil 1993, the District of Columbia (D.C.) maintained different minimum wages for different occupations.

 For this period, our minimum wage measures for D.C. were averages of these various minimum wages.

 prevailing minimum wages above the fed-

 wage was used in place of the relative minimum in the
 employment equations estimated by Neumark and
 Wascher (1992). The absolute minimum wage may
 also be more relevant than the relative minimum
 wage in analyses of absolute measures of poverty.

 Note that some states have minimum wage laws in
 which the state minimum is set below the federal
 level, so that a proportion of workers in these states
 will be covered by a state minimum but not by the
 federal minimum. For our sample period, the per-
 centage of workers covered by state but not federal
 laws is likely to be quite small (less than 10%). In
 addition, there are no reliable estimates for these
 state coverage proportions for the 1980s.

 addressed. Minimum wages often change
 within a calendar year, implying that our
 family income data (from a given calendar
 year) may correspond to two different peri-
 ods with different minima. For example,
 the federal minimum wage increases that
 occurred in 1990 and 1991 went into effect
 on April 1 in each of those years, so that the
 effective minimum wage in most states was
 different in the first three months and the
 last nine months. Our solution to this
 problem is to use a weighted average of the
 minimum wages when the minimum

 states with an above-federal minimum is
 provided in Table 1.

 The dependent variables are estimates
 of the true population quantities, and the
 variability of these estimates is likely to be
 higher when the underlying sample size is
 smaller. 12 This naturally leads to
 heteroskedasticity in the error terms in our
 regression, and so we use weighted least
 squares. The traditional solution is to as-
 sume that the error variance is inversely
 proportional to the sample size, but this
 approach implicitly assumes that the model
 would have a perfect fit if the population
 quantities were known. Accordingly, we
 use weights equal to the inverse of the
 predicted values from regressions of
 squared OLS residuals on a constant and
 the inverse of the weighted sample size for

 the particular state/year observation (see
 Blackburn 1997).13

 Findings

 Effects on Poverty

 Averages of the state-level poverty rates
 over the 1983-96 period are provided in
 the first row of Table 2. Poverty rates
 among the groups most likely to be affected
 by increases in the minimum wage are at
 least double those of prime-age individu-
 als. A similar result holds when poverty
 rates are calculated with poverty lines in-
 flated by 25%.

 We also calculated the percentage of
 individuals in families with incomes above
 three times the poverty line and above five
 times the poverty line (Table 2). The dif-
 ference between prime-age individuals and

 121n particular, our dependent variable is a

 weighted sample mean of the form p = Xw x., where xi
 is the individual poverty indicator and wi is the corre-
 sponding CPS weight for that individual (normalized
 to sum to one). This leads to a dependent variable
 with unconditional variance (due to sampling vari-
 ability) of IC(1-XC) XW2, where X is the true poverty rate.

 13The skedastic functions we estimate are of the
 form cy.2 = a+ bYw2. In instances in which the constant
 is not statistically significant (at the 5% level), we
 assume the variance of the error term is proportional
 to the sum of squared weights.

 teenagers or young adults (but not junior
 high dropouts) in the upper-income per-
 centages is somewhat smaller, reflecting a
 relatively high degree of income inequality
 among our low-wage groups. Not surpris-
 ingly, average weekly earnings appear to be
 considerably smaller for teenagers andjun-
 ior high dropouts (but less so for young
 adults) than for prime-age individuals.
 Table 2 also reports the average cell size for
 calculating the state/year statistics; these
 are all reasonably large, although there is
 naturally a great deal of variation in these
 cell sizes. Fortunately, the smallest cell size
 for any of our state/year observations is 34,
 so that none of our dependent variables is
 calculated using an extremely limited
 sample of individuals.

 Fixed-effects estimates of the impact of
 the minimum wage on the probability of
 being in poverty are reported in Table 3.14

 14We also estimated models in which the sample
 was restricted to state/year observations in which at
 least 60 individuals were used in constructing the
 poverty rate used as the dependent variable. Results
 under this sample restriction were qualitatively simi-
 lar to those obtained using the complete sample of
 state/year observations.

 We also calculated F-statistics for the presence of
 state and year effects. We uniformly rejected the null
 hypothesis that state effects are absent in Table 3.
 The analogous test for year effects often did not reject
 the null; however, we decided to include the year
 effects in all regressions to obviate the need to choose
 a specific price deflator.

 aWeights were constructed from a regression of squared OLS residuals on a constant and a factor propor-
 tional to the sampling error in the dependent variable. In situations where the constant in this regression was
 insignificant at the 5% level, it was dropped in obtaining the GLS estimates. The sample size for each regression
 is 714 (51 states observed in 14 years).

 bThe minimum wage variable is expressed in tens of 1996 dollars (using the CPI-U price index)
 cThe prime-age poverty rate is for all individuals aged between 25 and 54 years.
 dThis is average age in the targeted group, divided by 10.

 In specification (1), we include the loga-
 rithm of the minimum wage without a state-
 specific control for the business cycle. For
 each group, we find a negative estimated
 coefficient for the minimum wage variable,
 implying that higher minimum wages re-
 duce poverty. This estimate is statistically
 significant (at conventional levels) for both
 teenagers and junior high dropouts. The
 implied elasticity for both of these groups
 suggests that a 10% increase in the mini-
 mum wage would lower the dropout pov-
 erty rate by 5% (representing around a full
 percentage point drop for both of these
 groups). Among the group-specific con-
 trols, the percentage of the group that is
 white and non-hispanic always shows a
 strong and statistically significant decreas-

 ing effect on poverty that is quite consistent
 across groups. The coefficient estimate for
 the average age for the group is always
 negative, as expected, but is statistically
 significant only for junior high droputs
 (for whom there is much greater variation
 in this variable than for teenagers and young
 adults). 15

 15We also estimated specifications that included
 the percentage of the group that was female as an
 independent variable. This variable was statistically
 significant in many specifications (with the expected
 positive sign), but had essentially no effect on the
 estimated minimum wage effect coefficients. Addi-
 tionally, estimates using only the female part of the
 junior high dropout sample provided results that
 were similar to the estimates using the complete
 junior high dropout sample.

 In specification (2) of Table 3, we in-
 clude the prime-age poverty rate as an addi-
 tional independent variable. The coeffi-
 cient estimate for the prime-age poverty
 rate is always positive and statistically sig-
 nificant. Its inclusion reduces slightly the
 elasticity of the poverty rate with respect to
 the minimum, but the coefficient estimate
 remains statistically significant for junior
 high dropouts, and at least marginally sig-
 nificant for teenagers. Specification (3)
 substitutes the level of the minimum wage
 for its logarithm, with little effect on the
 statistical inference or implied elasticities.'6
 One problem with using the prime-age
 poverty rate as a control, however, is that it
 is not exogenously determined with respect
 to the poverty rate of other groups. In-
 deed, to the extent that many members of
 our affected groups reside with prime-age
 individuals, the poverty rates of the two
 groups are clearly simultaneously deter-
 mined. This problem is compounded by
 the fact that we use estimates of poverty
 rates, with many of the same families being
 used to form the poverty rates of the af-
 fected groups and the prime-age individu-
 als.'7 As an alternative control, therefore,
 we use the unemployment rate for prime-
 age individuals in specification (4) of Table
 3. With this control, estimated minimum

 16Because we are here using the level of the mini-
 mum wage rather than its logarithm, we now index
 for inflation using the CPI-U price index.

 '7We also estimated equations in which the prime-
 age poverty rate is the dependent variable, using the
 primerage unemployment rate as a cyclical control.
 The estimated coefficient (standard error) for the
 log of the minimum wage was -.034 (.014), suggesting
 that minimum wages do lower prime-age poverty.
 Although statistically significant, this coefficient esti-
 mate is smaller in absolute value than those reported
 in Table 3 for either teenagers or dropouts. The
 poverty-reducing effect for prime-age poverty could
 largely result from the fact that many prime-age indi-
 viduals are in families that also include teenagers and
 junior-high dropouts. Indeed, when we use as the
 dependent variable the poverty rate for prime-age
 individuals who have more than 12 years of schooling
 and live alone, we obtain a positive coefficient esti-
 mate (standard error) on the minimum wage variable
 of .042 (.034).

 wage effects are virtually identical to those
 obtained without cyclical controls. The
 final specification in Table 3 includes both
 the prime-age poverty rate and the male
 unemployment, with minimum wage re-
 sults the same as in specification (2).

 As a way of summarizing the estimated
 effects of minimum wages on poverty, we
 performed a back-of-the-envelope calcula-
 tion that combines the point estimates (for
 specification 5 of Table 3) for all three of
 our low-wage groups. The result suggests
 that a 25% increase in the minimum wage
 should lower the 1996 poverty rate for these
 three groups combined by 9% (a drop of
 1.9 percentage points, from a poverty rate
 of 22.4% to one of 20.5%). The 95% con-
 fidence interval ranges from a decline in
 the poverty rate of 14% to a decline of 3%. "
 By comparison, Burkhauser and Finegan
 (1989) found that a similar increase in the
 minimum wage in 1984 would have de-
 creased poverty among "low-wage" workers
 by 21%. Although comparisons are diffi-
 cult because of differences in the defini-
 tion of low-wage workers, our results do
 seem to suggest a poverty-reducing impact
 similar to that suggested by Burkhauser
 and Finegan.

 We next explored the sensitivity of our
 results to the estimation technique and the
 equation specification (see Table 4). First,
 we estimated our equations by OLS rather
 than weighted least squares, using standard
 errors that are asymptotically robust with
 respect to heteroskedasticity in the error
 term. This is an alternative manner of
 handling the heteroskedasticity problem
 that naturally arises from the difference in
 cell sizes across states and years. Unfortu-
 nately, these results (presented in the first
 numerical column in the table) suggest
 that our findings are somewhat sensitive to
 the estimation technique. The absolute
 value of the minimum wage coefficient es-

 18The calculation of the confidence interval as-
 sumes that the coefficient estimates for the three
 groups are uncorrelated, and that the prime-age pov-
 erty rate is unaffected by minimum wage changes.

 aUnless otherwise noted, all estimations use the same specification as in the fifth specification of Table 3, and

 use the same GLS correction as noted in that table.

 timate for teenagers increases, while the
 young adult and dropout coefficient esti-
 mates decrease in absolute value. The gen-
 eral tenor of the results is similar-a de-
 creasing effect-but the particular group
 that is most affected does change with these
 results. Given the considerable variation in
 sample sizes (and therefore in error vari-
 ances), we prefer the GLS estimates of Table
 3, as they should be efficient under the
 assumed model for heteroskedasticity.
 Nonetheless, either manner of handling
 heteroskedasticity leads to the conclusion
 that there is considerably stronger evidence
 of poverty-reducing effects for teenagers
 and dropouts than for young adults.

 A second sensitivity consideration stems
 from concerns about the arbitrariness of
 the poverty-line threshold. We used an
 alternative poverty rate as the dependent
 variable, based on poverty lines that are set
 25% higher than the official lines. These
 results are provided in the second numeri-
 cal column of Table 4. There is now consid-
 erably less evidence of a poverty-reducing
 effect for teenagers (while the estimated
 coefficient for young adults is again statisti-
 cally insignificant), but the effect for drop-
 outs remains statistically significant and of
 a magnitude similar to that found using the
 official poverty lines. It would appear that
 any decrease in poverty arising from mini-

 mum wage increases for teenagers is prima-
 rily serving to push individuals initially in
 poverty to income levels that are just above
 the official poverty lines.

 Neumark and Wascher (1992) found
 evidence of a lagged response of employ-
 ment to changes in the minimum wage. We
 considered a similar lagged response on
 poverty by estimating models that also in-
 cluded the minimum wage lagged one year
 as an independent variable. The results are
 presented in the third column of Table 4.
 The coefficient estimate for the lagged
 minimum wage is never individually statis-
 tically significant. It is also the case that the
 sum of the coefficients on the current and
 lagged minimum wage is always negative.
 However, this sum is statistically significant
 only for junior high dropouts (for whom
 the estimated total impact is exactly the
 same as in Table 3). For teenagers, the sum
 is of a magnitude similar to that without the
 lag, but the statistical quality of the support
 is weakened. There is considerably less
 evidence of an effect for young adults in
 this specification.

 In an earlier version of this paper, we
 found very little evidence of a poverty-re-
 ducing effect forjunior high dropouts. Two
 major differences between our current
 specifications and those of the earlier ver-
 sion are that we were considering a shorter
 time period, and that we failed to include
 important group-specific characteristics. To
 illustrate the importance of the choice of
 sample period to the estimated minimum
 wage effects, the penultimate column of
 Table 4 reports results when the sample is
 restricted to observations from the 1983-
 89 period. When information from the
 1990s is excluded, we see very little evi-
 dence of a minimum wage effect (the coef-
 ficient estimate for teenagers is actually
 positive). Admittedly, the standard errors
 are increased due to the reduction in the
 sample size, but the failure to find a statis-
 tically significant estimate in the limited
 time period is due to the change in the
 coefficient estimates and not merely to an
 increase in their standard errors. It ap-
 pears that the nature of the minimum
 wage effect on poverty changed in an

 important manner between the 1980s and
 the 1990s.

 The fixed-effects procedure assumes that
 the state effects are stable over the sample
 period for which the equation is estimated.
 If this restriction is inappropriate, the
 changes in the minimum wage could be
 partly picking up differential trends in the
 demand conditions for low-wage workers
 within states. This could be behind the
 different results found when the sample
 period is restricted to 1983-89, as the state
 effects are more likely to be essentially stable
 over a shorter period. One way to relax the
 constraint of stable state effects is to in-
 clude additional controls that allow for sepa-
 rate trend effects for each state. Estimates
 with these additional controls are presented
 in the final column of Table 4. These
 additional controls greatly weaken the sup-
 port for a poverty-reducing effect of mini-
 mum wages for teenagers (compared to the
 results in the final column of Table 3), but
 they have no effect on the estimated coeffi-
 cient for dropouts.'9

 In summary, there is considerable evi-
 dence of a poverty-reducing effect of mini-
 mum wages for junior high dropouts, and
 this evidence primarily comes from reac-
 tions to minimum wages thatwere increased
 in the 1990s. There is also evidence of a
 poverty-reducing effect for teenagers, but
 this support is much more sensitive to is-
 sues of specification.

 Effects on Earnings and Employment

 We also estimate equations in which the
 dependent variable is average earnings of
 individuals in our low-wage groups. Our
 intention is to explore the connection be-
 tween changes in the minimum wage and
 these average earnings amounts. The first
 two columns of Table 5 present results for
 specifications (with cyclical and group-spe-
 cific controls) in which we use either the
 log of annual earnings or the log of weekly

 19Asagroup, the state/trend interactions are never

 statistically significant at conventional levels.

 cThis is annual earnings in the annual earnings equations, and weekly earnings in the other equations .

 earnings as the dependent variable. These
 results suggest an increasing impact of
 higher minimum wages on both annual
 earnings and weekly earnings for all three
 low-wage groups. The impact appears stron-
 gest for teenagers, while for young adults
 and junior high dropouts the estimated
 coefficients suggest elasticities from
 changes in the minimum wage of 40% or
 less for both annual earnings and weekly
 earnings. Although the effect on average
 earnings appears strongest for teenagers,
 Table 3 indicated stronger poverty-reduc-
 ing effects of minimum wages among jun-
 ior high dropouts. This dissonance may
 partly result from a more direct connection
 between earnings and family income for

 junior high dropouts than for teenagers.
 Thus, for example, in 1996, the average
 earnings of a junior high dropout repre-
 sented 22% of the associated average fam-
 ily income, whereas the average teenager's
 earnings at that time were 1 % of his or her
 family income.

 We also estimate equations that allow us
 to explore the impact of minimum wages
 on the employment of workers in our low-
 wage groups, although that is not the pri-
 mary focus of the paper. The March CPS
 contains information on weeks worked over
 the calendar year, which we averaged across
 individuals in each of our groups to pro-
 vide a measure of average weeks worked
 over the year in each state. The logarithm

 of this variable was then used as the depen-
 dent variable in equations that included
 the log of the minimum wage as an inde-
 pendent variable. We also included the log
 of average weeks worked for prime-age in-
 dividuals as a control, as well as the unem-
 ployment rate and the log of average weekly
 earnings for prime-age individuals. Given
 the definition of the dependent variable,
 these equations are comparable to equa-
 tions elsewhere in the literature that esti-
 mate disemployment effects by regressing
 the employment rate on a function of the
 minimum wage. The primary difference is
 that we are implicitly using the employ-
 ment rate averaged over the 52 weeks of the
 year, rather than the employment rate in a
 given week, as the dependent variable.20

 The fitted equations for the full sample
 period are presented in the third numeri-
 cal column in Table 5, and the results are,
 frankly, unexpected. Previous work would
 predict a negative coefficient estimate for
 the minimum wage variable, but in our
 results the point estimate is positive for all
 three groups. And although statistically
 insignificant for young adults, the mini-
 mum wage coefficient estimate is statisti-
 cally significant for junior high dropouts
 and (at least marginally) for teenagers. The
 estimates can be interpreted as elasticities,
 and suggest a particularly large positive
 elasticity of 40% for junior high dropouts.
 The minimum wage effect we find for
 teenagers is not typical of research findings
 in this area (we are not aware of any parallel
 research results for junior high dropouts).
 The usual finding is that minimum wages
 tend to lower teenage employment rates.
 Thus, for example, in a similar analysis of
 employment effects, Neumark and Wascher
 (1992) reported an elasticity of teenage
 employment with respect to the minimum
 wage of roughly -0.1. One obvious differ-
 ence between our study and theirs is the
 time period examined, Neumark and

 Wascher's sample period ending in 1989.
 The difference in time periods again seems
 to be a major factor explaining the differ-
 ence in our results; if we confine our sample
 period to 1983-89, we also obtain a nega-
 tive coefficient estimate that indicates a
 small (but statistically insignificant) elas-
 ticity of -0.2 (see the last column of Table
 6) .21 Results for dropouts also provide much
 less evidence of an employment-increasing
 effect from raising minimum wages when
 estimated using only the data from the
 1980s. In fact, our employment estimates
 are more consistent with the line of re-
 search advocated by Card and Krueger
 (1995), including the studies by Card
 (1992a), Card (1992b), Katz and Krueger
 (1992), Card, Katz, and Krueger (1994),
 and Card and Krueger (1994).

 As noted earlier, the evidence of a pov-
 erty-reducing effect from raising minimum
 wages largely comes from the experience in
 the 1990s. This pattern seems to coincide
 with a change in the employment effects of
 minimum wages that also appears to have
 occurred after 1990. Given the lack of
 evidence of an employment-reducing ef-
 fect from higher minimums in this period
 (and the possibility that employment might
 have even been increased), it is not surpris-
 ing that there is also evidence that poverty
 is reduced because of these post-1990 in-
 creases. It is also informative that our
 coefficient estimates suggest a poverty-re-
 ducing effect of a magnitude similar to that
 suggested by Burkhauser and Finegan
 (1989); they assumed no disemployment
 effects in performing their simulations, and
 our evidence suggests that this assumption
 may not have been misleading.

 Summary and Discussion

 Studies of minimum wage effects on the
 employment of low-wage workers typically use

 20Another difference is that we estimate our re-
 gressions in logarithmic form, although results of a
 similar nature are found if the level of weeks worked
 is used.

 21There are several other differences between the
 two studies; for example, the specification of the
 minimum wage variable differs (Neumark and
 Wascher use the Kaitz index), and we do not control
 for school enrollment behavior.

 a reduced-form approach to examine the
 association between changes in the mini-
 mum wage and employment rates of teen-
 agers or young adults. We employ a similar
 strategy in investigating the relationship
 between minimum wage changes and the
 family income position of low-wage work-
 ers, using state-level panel data. Most pre-
 vious studies of minimum wage effects on
 the income distribution have relied on simu-
 lation exercises that potentially ignore many
 of the important consequences of mini-
 mum wages. Our analysis does not make
 any assumptions about these consequences,
 thereby allowing an improved and more
 direct method for estimating the impact of
 minimum wages on the distribution of fam-
 ily income.

 Our results provide evidence that in-
 creases in minimum wages in the 1990s
 have served to reduce poverty. This evi-
 dence is strongest when we examine the
 poverty rates ofjunior high dropouts. There
 is also evidence that minimum wages re-
 duce poverty for teenagers, but support for
 this result is somewhat more sensitive to
 specification changes (in particular, to al-
 lowing state effects to follow separate trends
 over time). In contrast, our results suggest
 that minimum wage increases in the 1980s
 did not reduce poverty for the groups we
 examine. A supplementary analysis of em-
 ployment for our low-wage groups suggests
 that this difference may be associated with
 a complete lack of any disemployment ef-
 fect from higher wage minima in the 1990s.
 Indeed, our results suggest that there may
 even be an employment-increasing effect
 from higher minimum wages during this
 period (at least for junior high dropouts
 and for teenagers).

 What underlies this apparent change in
 the impact of the minimum wages on both
 employment and poverty? We are not sure.
 Both the 1983-89 period and the 1990-96
 period began with the economy in a down-
 turn, and ended with sustained growth. It
 is therefore difficult to argue that there was
 more room for the minimum wage to im-
 prove the economic conditions of low-wage
 workers in the later period than in the
 earlier one. It is true that the labor market

 situation of low-skilled workers deteriorated
 rapidly during the 1980s, and that this dete-
 rioration did not continue during the early
 1990s (though it had not begun any rever-
 sion before 1995). Yet for this change to
 account for the pattern of our results, it
 would have to be the case that the relative
 demand shifts against low-wage workers
 varied across states in a manner that was
 correlated with minimum wage changes in
 those states, and it is again difficult to see
 how this might be the case.

 We did examine the possibility that our
 employment and poverty findings reflected
 differences between minimum wage-in-
 creasing states and other states in the rela-
 tive supply of low-skilled to high-skilled
 labor. Our approach was to include the
 ratio of the population of the low-wage
 group to the population of prime-age indi-
 viduals as an additional regressor in our
 employment equations. The coefficient on
 this variable was generally not statistically
 significant, however, and often had an un-
 expected positive sign (we expected that a
 reduced supply of a low-wage group would
 increase employment of that group). It
 also tended to leave the minimum wage
 coefficient estimate unaffected.

 We also considered whether or not the
 general economic conditions in states that
 increased minimum wages on their own
 accord differed greatly from those in states
 that chose not to do so, and, in particular,
 whether these differences might have them-
 selves been greater for states increasing
 minima in the 1990s than for those increas-
 ing minima in the 1980s. It is conceivable
 that the labor market conditions confront-
 ing junior high dropouts were particularly
 severe (relative to the nation as a whole) in
 states that increased minimum wages in the
 1990s, as opposed to the 1980s, implying
 that there was more potential improvement
 in those conditions in the 1990s as the
 overall economy improved. To make these
 comparisons, we separated states into those
 that did and those that did not raise mini-
 mum wages over the 1983-89 period, and
 computed some average characteristics at
 the start of that period (1983) for these two
 groups of states. These averages are pre-

 sented in the first two columns of results in
 Table 6.

 It is clear that economic conditions were
 initially better in those states that did in-
 crease wage minima, and that this differ-
 ence was particularly large in the poverty
 rate for junior high dropouts. But if a
 similar type of comparison is drawn for
 states increasing minimum wages in the
 1989-96 interval (measuring conditions at
 the start of that period), much the same
 pattern is observed-see the final two col-
 umns of Table 6. This should not be too
 surprising, given that it is largely the same
 group of states increasing minimums in
 both periods.22

 We are not sure why minimum wages
 appear to have had such different effects in
 the 1990s and 1980s. The fact that these

 22As can be seen from Table 1, only NewJersey and
 Iowa increased their minimum wage in the 1989-96

 differences show up in both employment
 and poverty analyses is intriguing to us, and
 suggests that it may be useful to apply re-
 search strategies from previous papers that
 discovered disemployment effects to data
 from the 1990s to see if these results con-
 tinue to hold. It is also interesting that the
 paper most often cited for suggesting a
 positive employment effect from minimum
 wages (Card and Krueger 1994) studied a
 minimum wage change that occurred in
 the 1990s. It may be that we are seeing a
 continuation of a trend pointed out by
 Wellington (1991), who noted the dissipa-
 tion through time of the negative employ-
 ment effects of minimum wages.

 period but not in the earlier period. Only Wisconsin
 increased its minimum in the 1983-89 period but not
 in the later period. The comparisons in Table 6 are
 still useful, however, as the economic conditions in
 those states relative to the nation as a whole could
 have changed between the two periods.
