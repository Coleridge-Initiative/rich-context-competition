While delayed home-leaving has largely been examined
through a sociodemographic lens and from the perspective of
its psychological causes and effects (e.g., Allen, Hauser,
Eickholt, Bell, & O'Connor, 1994; Kins, Beyers, Soenens, &
Vansteenkiste, 2009; Kins, Soenens, & Beyers, 2011;
McLean & Mansfield, 2012), there is a paucity of literature
regarding developmentally appropriate interventions for this
age group (Sachs, 2013), an age group that is significantly
underserved despite its heightened risk for mental health
problems (Blanco et al., 2008). Furthermore, there are no
clinical studies that specifically address the mental health
treatment of the co-residing emerging adult, a subgroup that
is increasingly prevalent in the affluent communities we
serve, and who, in our experience, can be quite clinically
challenging. In the more difficult cases, the emerging adult is
functioning at a delayed or regressive state, which we have
termed unfinished adolescence. Indicators of such a state
include a nocturnal sleep­wake cycle, an overriding focus on
videogame playing and social media, a tepid engagement
with work or school, a weak commitment toward seeking
employment, and/or frequent conflicts with parents. In the
most severe cases, the young adult is neither pursuing work
nor higher education and is emotionally shut down or ver-
bally abusive, if not physically threatening, to one or both
parents who present as defeated, frozen, anxious, or angry.
Most frequently, the parents present with an excruciating
bind: They want to "kick the kid out" but they cannot take
this step for fear that their child will suffer immensely from
such an action.
The purpose of this article is to address the needs of this
developmentally distinct and growing clinical population
from a specific theoretical model known as constructivist
control mastery theory (Lieb & Kanofsky, 2003). This clini-
cal approach appears to be particularly well suited for treating
emerging adults and their parents. Constructivist control mas-
tery theory's integration of narrative and psychodynamic
paradigms provides a powerful set of clinical tools in facili-
tating the acquisition of a healthy young adult identity which
is being impeded by separation-individuation pathology.
Because the definition of adulthood is so fluid during this cur-
rent historical period, emerging adults require aid in creating
a narrative identity, which is developed through their conver-
sations with others (Cox & McAdams, 2012; Habermas &
Bluck, 2000; McAdams et al., 2008; McLean, 2005; McLean
& Mansfield, 2012). Parents play an especially important

From Unfinished Adolescent to Young
Adult: A Constructivist Control Mastery
Theory Approach to the Treatment of the
Emerging Adult Still Living at Home
Robert J. Lieb1 and W. David Auld2
Abstract
The distinct time in life known as emerging adulthood presents its own unique developmental challenges, most centrally the
creation of an adult identity. However, an increasing number of young adults today are not living on their own, as would be
expected, but instead are living with their families of origin. For some, co-residence is largely a function of current economic
forces. For others, it is evidence of problems with the separation-individuation process. Assessing relational maturity and the
development of autonomously valued goals is crucial in forming a treatment plan. Constructivist control mastery theory is
a treatment approach that integrates psychodynamic and narrative paradigms and is especially well suited for the treatment
of this population, whether applied as a family therapy or individual therapy. This approach focuses on fostering mastery-
oriented conversations that facilitate the emergence of adult identity.

role in scaffolding these identity-making stories (McLean &
Mansfield, 2012). For this reason, our clinical approach is
centered on creating those conversations that facilitate the
emergence of adult identity.
Overview of the Treatment Model
Our approach to treating these unfinished adolescents/emerg-
ing adults is based on the integration of control mastery the-
ory (Weiss, Sampson, & The Mount Zion Psychotherapy
Research Group, 1986), and narrative therapy (White &
Epston, 1990) from a family systems perspective (Kanofsky
& Lieb, 2007). Control mastery theory elaborates Freud's
(1926) later idea that psychological problems are rooted in
grim, largely unconscious beliefs that have been inferred
from traumatic early experiences, usually within the family
or with other primary caretakers. In line with attachment
research (e.g., Beebe, Lachmann, & Jaffe, 1998; Bowlby,
1988; Gopnik, Kuhl, & Meltzoff, 1999; Schor, 1997; Stern,
1985), control mastery theory asserts that all children develop
a set of beliefs about safe or unsafe ways to adapt to the fam-
ily environment while simultaneously attempting to meet
important personal developmental needs and strivings. The
emphasis on the child's primary motives of adaptation to the
family and altruistic concern for the well-being of family
members, even at the child's expense, contributes to a
humanistic, systemic, and non-pathologizing clinical stance.
While highly adaptive in one sense, the beliefs inferred
from traumatic experiences (trauma is loosely defined as any
early experience or set of experiences that harm the child or
important others) are termed pathogenic because they inhibit
the child from pursuing preferred goals and give rise to trou-
bling feelings, problematic behaviors, and interpersonal con-
flicts. Pathogenic beliefs are formed in a number of ways.
They most commonly occur when a child attempts to achieve
certain developmentally appropriate goals and discovers that
such attempts repeatedly lead to trauma for the child or par-
ent. From these experiences, the child creates cognitive rep-
resentations of the world that ultimately impede personal
growth if they remain unquestioned and unconscious. Guilt
is the feeling tone that validates these beliefs, its power
rooted in deep attachment needs and altruistic impulses.
When activated, these pathogenic beliefs have an emotional
immediacy that makes them seem patently true. For exam-
ple, omnipotent responsibility guilt involves a pathogenic
belief that exaggerates the sense of responsibility for the
well-being of loved ones. Separation guilt involves a patho-
genic belief that one's separateness from loved ones causes
them harm, and survivor guilt is characterized by the patho-
genic belief that pursuing normal goals and achieving suc-
cess and happiness will cause others to suffer simply by
comparison (O'Connor, Berry, & Weiss, 1999; O'Connor,
Berry, Weiss, Bush, & Sampson, 1997). Pathogenic beliefs
also develop as a result of the child's compliance with paren-
tal treatment and messages. Given their dependence and lack
of prior experience, children are prone to believe that the
treatment they receive from their parents is deserved. Finally,
pathogenic beliefs are often perpetuated over generations as
children identify unconsciously with certain behaviors, atti-
tudes, and beliefs expressed by their parents, which are later
transmitted to their own progeny.
Control mastery theory further asserts that individuals
come to therapy highly motivated to overcome the suffering
derived from pathogenic beliefs and want to pursue their pre-
ferred life goals. This guiding focus on the client's inherent
motivation for health represents the mastery component of
the theory and has a very hopeful and collaborative effect on
treatment. Control mastery theory holds that, in the course of
therapy, clients work to overcome their pathogenic beliefs
primarily through a process of consciously and uncon-
sciously testing their beliefs with the therapist. Testing of
pathogenic beliefs is viewed as a fundamental activity in and
out of therapy for adapting to one's interpersonal world and
achieving personal goals.
There are two types of testing. In transference testing, the
client, initially in an unconscious fashion, behaves with the
therapist as he or she responded to the caretakers involved
with the original traumatization that led to the formation of
pathogenic beliefs. The client is seen to be unconsciously
hoping that the therapist will not repeat the traumatization. In
the other primary form of testing, passive-into-active testing,
clients switch roles and treat the therapist or others in the
traumatizing ways they were treated in the development of
their pathogenic beliefs. The unconscious goal of pas-
sive-into-active testing is that the person being tested will not
be traumatized and succumb to the same pathogenic beliefs,
thus helping to overcome the client's beliefs by demonstrat-
ing that such treatment is not deserved and by modeling vari-
ous ways of coping with it.
We believe that control mastery theory can be effectively
reformulated as a critical constructivist approach to psycho-
therapy. Critical constructivists take the postmodern position
that we do not simply observe our world; we actively partici-
pate in creating its meaning. In line with control mastery
theory, critical constructivism emphasizes the centrality of
subjective structures or schemas in fashioning the individu-
al's adaptation to, and understanding of, various environ-
mental realities (Dorpat & Miller, 1992; Lichtenberg, 1984;
Slap & Saykin, 1983; Stern, 1985; Stolorow & Atwood,
1979). Critical constructivists view the acquisition of these
personal representations of reality as occurring through a
social process of interaction with the environment (Mahoney,
1991). This is fortuitous, from a clinical perspective, because
it implies that these constructs are also amenable to change
through a social process.
We have used primarily the narrative therapy work of
Michael White and David Epston (1990) in developing a
methodology of change which is synergistic with a control
mastery therapy, constructively conceived. Narrative therapy
offers control mastery theory a new root metaphor: stories.
Lieb and Auld 3
This root metaphor generates a methodology of change that
can vividly animate our control mastery work. The aim of
narrative therapy is to focus on the person's unique story of
their experience, realizing that his or her stories are construc-
tions, and not universal or immutable truths. Each and every
action is a "performance of meaning" (Bruner, 1986) that
simultaneously re-authors past experience and frames subse-
quent experience.
Our model conceptualizes that the therapist is participat-
ing, at any given moment, in one of three story lines that the
client is telling about him/herself through their words and
actions. One of these story lines is the problem story, which
significantly limits the client's well-being. Participation in
this pathogenic story, using control mastery language, is
anti-plan and not helpful. In contrast, participation in the
other two story lines is pro-plan and facilitates the attainment
of the client's goals. The first of these pro-plan story engage-
ments we call the deconstructive story of psychotherapy and
the second we term the constructive story of psychotherapy.
Control mastery theory provides a coherent and effective
framework for deconstructing, or undermining, the client's
pathogenic story, and we call on narrative techniques and
tenets to further weaken its effect on the client. However,
from our perspective, narrative therapy makes an even more
important contribution to control mastery theory with its
postmodern emphasis on the creative or constructive work of
psychotherapy. We have found it extremely helpful to par-
ticipate in our clients' constructions of their mastery stories,
which can evolve as alternatives to their pathogenic beliefs/
stories. It is our thesis that the limiting effect of pathogenic
stories will lessen as we facilitate more preferred stories that
are as elaborated and compelling as the pathogenic stories.
While control mastery theory provides the compass, narra-
tive therapy equips us with additional means to follow its
direction.
Assessment
Our assessment protocol focuses on determining the extent
to which the mastery story of emerging adulthood is evolv-
ing in the family as evidenced by the interactions between
the emerging adult and his or her parents. From this perspec-
tive, it is important to understand what qualities are associ-
ated with successful launching and placing presenting
complaints in the context of their normative developmental
baselines. This is a clinically important application ofArnett's
(2000) assertion that emerging adulthood is a distinct life
stage. In other words, if we do not know what is normal for
this age, how can we determine what is pathological?
Otherwise, we run the risk of treating normally developing
young adults as if they were pathological and in so doing,
iatrogenically increase family discord, heighten parental dis-
tress, and create psychopathology in the young adult.
Conversely, treating individuals who are developmentally
delayed and suffering with mental health issues as if they
were developing normally will only maintain or exacerbate
the problem.
While a certain level of instability is the norm at this age,
there are certain individual and dyadic characteristics that are
associated with the successful transition to adulthood and oth-
ers that are associated with "separation-individuation pathol-
ogy" (Kins et al., 2011). One key is the development of
relational maturity (Aquilino, 2005; Nelson et al., 2007). We
assess relational maturity by evaluating the extent to which
there is a dynamic balance of autonomy coupled with a com-
mensurate capacity to stay emotionally engaged with the par-
ents (Baltes & Silverberg, 1994; Frank, Butler-Avery, &
Laman, 1988; Grotevant & Cooper, 1986; Kins et al., 2011;
Smollar & Youniss, 1989).Acompletely dismissive and disen-
gaged relation to the parents is as strong an indicator of sepa-
ration-individuation problems as is preoccupation with the
parentsandover-dependency(Scharf,Mayseless,&Kivenson-
Baron, 2004). In this regard, we assess the extent to which
child and parent are creating a narrative of increasing symme-
try and decreasing hierarchy in their relationship (Aquilino,
1997; Grotevant & Cooper, 1986; Kins et al., 2009; Kins et al.,
2011; Levy-Warren, 1999). We look for evidence that inde-
pendence and interdependence are integrated, and a growing
capacity to negotiate from more co-equal positions.
One of the relational qualities that most clearly distin-
guishes this phase of the life cycle from the previous adoles-
cent phase is that the child is becoming increasingly aware of
the capacity to influence his or her parents' well-being while
the parents are increasingly more willing to be influenced
and supported (Aquilino, 2005; Nydegger, 1991). Increased
consideration of parental well-being represents a diminish-
ment of egocentricity and sets the stage for later caregiving
behavior (Aquilino, 2005; Badger, Nelson, & Barry, 2006).
Therefore, we evaluate the young adult's capacity to empath-
ically understand the parents' life experiences and needs
from an independent point of view and not just as an exten-
sion of their own wants and needs.
In addition to assessing the emerging adult's relational
maturity, we also are interested in evaluating the extent to
which the emerging adult is capable of taking value-driven
actions. We look for actions that express competence and self-
direction as the primary motivators for moving forward in
their lives (Moore, 1987; Ryan & Deci, 2000; Vansteenkiste,
Williams, & Resnicow, 2012). We determine the extent to
which the young adult is engaging in goal-setting and initiat-
ing steps that are consistent with self-identified values. We
inquire whether the young person is actively engaged in some
process of intellectual development, regularly working or
volunteering in an area of personal interest. Conversely, we
evaluate whether the young adult's primary focus is on pas-
sive pursuits or escapist entertainment that is inhibiting his or
her ability to engage in adult-like challenges. Clearly addic-
tion, which is prevalent in this population, impedes both the
formation of relational maturity and the development of goal-
directed behaviors based on autonomous values.

We also assess through the lens of the family system.
From this perspective, it is essential to evaluate the parents'
attachment styles as manifested in their part of the relational
equation. Relating to the emerging adult child from the
standpoint of past parenting practices founded in adoles-
cence is a recipe for disaster. We want to know if they are
capable of bestowing their "blessing" on their child for
becoming an adult (Blos, 1985). Can they empathically sup-
port autonomy while remaining ready to provide emotional
and, when appropriate, financial support?AsAquilino (2006)
has stated, "In an ideal situation, parents are partners with
their offspring in the quest for independence" (p. 201).
Conversely, parental separation anxiety generates control-
ling behaviors, which rob the young adult of the sense of
autonomy and supplant it with compliance. It is imperative
to assess the extent to which worry/intrusiveness and anger/
rejection are dominant tones in the parents' relation to their
emerging adult child.
Finally, we assess the stability of the marital system and
the level of schism between the parents, especially with
regard to the parenting of their child. Instability and schism
foster the pathogenic story that individuation-separation is
an abandonment of the parents and creates unconscious guilt,
which hobbles the emerging adult child. We need to know
the family history of how the split developed and each par-
ent's attachment history to determine the intergenerational
contributions to the schism.
Application of the Model
Our approach is centered on changing the nature of the con-
versation between parent and child. We continually seek to
undermine pathogenic adult-to-adolescent conversational pat-
terns and promote the enactment of adult-to-adult conversa-
tions. We integrate control mastery theory and narrative
therapy to change the conversation, not the people. This exter-
nalizing shift (White & Epston, 1990) serves to depathologize
the young adult in the parents' eyes, and more effectively sep-
arates the young adult from their anachronistic adolescent
identity. The shift to focusing on communication processes
aligns the parents and child toward a common value: to have a
more adult-to-adult relationship. We frame those instances
when this is not happening, which is the majority of time in the
beginning of treatment, as instances when the unfinished ado-
lescent script is holding the family back. The richer we can
make the alternative description, the more meaningful and
sustainable the developmental progression. To this end, we
vividly bring forward behaviors, thoughts, emotions, inten-
tions, identities, and relationships through which the family is
having influence over their problematic interactions and creat-
ing new, developmentally appropriate patterns.
Most commonly, we bifurcate treatment with one therapist
seeing the young adult child and the other seeing the parents.
However, there are times when we never meet the young
adult, cases when we only see the young adult, and other
instances when we "mix and match," including the young
adult into some or all of the family sessions. In line with con-
trol mastery theory, the approach is highly case specific. The
decision of whom to work with is primarily based on how
"stuck" the young adult is to his or her unfinished adolescent
story. To the extent the young adult is fully oppressed by that
story, for example with addiction issues, we opt to work with
the parents; if that's less the case, then we work with the fam-
ily. On the other hand, if the child is presenting more as an
emerging adult then we actively promote that emerging qual-
ity by choosing to see him or her individually. Along those
lines, to the extent the young adult is developing adaptively,
the emphasis is put on them to "take the lead" in constructing
the family's emerging adult story.
Parents tend to present for treatment with an enormous
amount of worry and/or anger about their young adult child.
Their worry emanates from a story that their child is inca-
pacitated, which naturally calls for rescuing responses. From
an attachment perspective, anything less is experienced as an
act of abandonment. Over time, an under-functioning/over-
functioning dynamic calcifies in the family. Operating from
this narrative, it makes perfect sense that a parent would
devote himself/herself to "fixing" their needy child, spend-
ing hours on the Internet looking for jobs for their young
adult, reminding them constantly to participate in the run-
ning of the household, financially supporting them while
they are engaged in no meaningful activities, or most cru-
cially, allowing them to live at home when they are abusing
drugs and/or abusive to the parents. Alternatively, the anger
position emanates from a story of manipulation and defiance.
This construction impels the parent to exercise their author-
ity over their child, which only maintains a compliant-defi-
ant interactional pattern. These parents feel punished by their
child and adopt an authoritarian stance (Baumrind, 1966)
focused on punishing their bad behavior, an extension of
their adolescent parenting practices. However, the rub is that
now they have very few "cards to play" other than to kick the
child out of the house. In these cases, we see chronic, and, at
times, violent conflict between parent and child.
In our experience, worry and anger co-exist for the par-
ents in these families. Unfortunately, the parents are almost
always split across these two positions, and their conflicting
views of the child gridlock their capacity to effectively par-
ent and therefore perpetuate the developmental impasse in
the young adult. However, underneath the marital schism,
shared feelings of fear, guilt, and shame reflect a greater
story of parental failure. The failure-based substrate of the
parents' pathogenic story drives an explicit control agenda.
The child must change for the parents to feel better about
themselves. This context is not conducive for the child to
emerge as a young adult.
The Deconstructive Work
Deconstructing content.The purpose of the deconstructive
work of psychotherapy is to undermine the manifestations of
the pathogenic story and its hold over the family. Like a
Lieb and Auld 5
literary critic, we seek to collapse the story on itself so that its
participants increasingly experience its manifestations as
dissonant, not who they are or want to be. The first step in
undermining the hold of the pathogenic story is to help each
member see how life-limiting these adult-to-adolescent
interactions are. We deconstruct stories of despair in which
parents view their child as incompetent and an object of
worry with a powerful alternative thematic structure of altru-
ism and nobility. For example, Haley's (1980) seminal book,
Leaving Home, is replete with cases of young adults who
handicap themselves to deflect attention away from their par-
ents' unhappy marriages. In other words, the young adult's
development is primarily inhibited by their concern that
emancipation may hurt their parents and/or siblings. How-
ever, in contrast to Haley's assumption that the family is
invested in maintaining a homeostasis, we start with a more
humanistic assumption. We believe these young adults and
their parents want to achieve mastery over their difficulties.
We also work to cultivate the parents' ability to generate
their own counter-narratives and deconstruct pathogenic sto-
ries. We have conceptualized this treatment component as
teaching parents, to "think like a therapist and act like a par-
ent." To accomplish this task, we use a psycho-educational
approach that teaches them how to employ the control mas-
tery theory plan formulation method (Curtis, Silberschatz,
Sampson, & Weiss, 1994). As such, we work to promote an
understanding of the young adult's behaviors as representing
unconsciously planned efforts to test hypotheses about
whether it is safe to grow up. Parents learn how to: identify
their child's life values; the obstructions to realizing this
value-based living; how those obstructions were developed;
what tests their child is hoping the parents will pass to dis-
confirm these hypotheses; what attitudes, behaviors, and dis-
courses will pass these tests; and how their own family of
origin experiences obstruct their capacity to act in a pro-plan
manner.
Deconstructing context.The cultural context is particularly
germane for the deconstructive work with this population
(Lieb & Kanofsky, 2003). Cultural prescriptions about what
constitutes normal development at this stage of life are
increasingly anachronistic, leaving families feeling lost and
confused. Without a roadmap, parents pressure themselves,
and each other, to coerce the young adult child into conform-
ing to outdated cultural prescriptions of young adulthood.
Under the critical gaze of the culture, these families are fail-
ures, and so they feel and act like failures, demoralized and
stuck. Of course, we, as therapists, can only be expert in our
own local culture, aware of the ways its prescriptions oppress
the individual or facilitate life satisfaction. In our local afflu-
ent, high achieving culture, the bar that represents successful
child-rearing is set very high and failure to conform to those
standards can profoundly oppress and isolate the individual
and family. Deconstructing this failure-soaked story into one
in which the "culture is the culprit," not the child, is often
key in fueling the family's capacity to construct a more adult-
to-adult relationship. With families whose child is higher on
the spectrum of emerging young adulthood, unmasking these
oppressive cultural assumptions allows the family to take a
common stand against their dictates and provides them the
freedom to co-create their own path through this develop-
mental phase.
The Constructive Work
Co-authoring new mastery stories means that parents and
young adult children must actively participate in adult-to-
adult conversations with each other. Often parents cannot
recognize the non-dominant, hidden stories when the young
adult is relating like an adult because they are so focused on
the problem. Without witnessing this mastery story, progres-
sive behavior never gets any traction. Our task is to bring
forward these alternative narratives in the landscapes of con-
sciousness and action.
Taking the inward turn. We co-construct a new mastery story
in a number of ways. To promote differentiation, we help
the parents take an intrapersonal focus. The pull for parents
to focus on and control the child's behavior is very strong
and represents a continuation of earlier parenting practices
that now function to retard development. Rather than coop-
erating with the parents' presenting agenda to help them
rectify their failures to "grow their child up," the patho-
genic story, we encourage a focus on how to become less
reactive to their own fear and guilt. Parents continually
need to be re-directed to learn how to still themselves and
hold their anxiety and guilt, and the narratives that generate
these emotional states, with more psychological distance.
The more emotionally differentiated the parents become,
the more space there is for the young adult child to differ-
entiate. Or as a client of ours once said, "My child can't
launch unless I do."
Fostering adult-to-adult interactions.Adult identity is nour-
ished in every instance when members of the family, indi-
vidually or collectively, demonstrate an adult-to-adult pattern
of communication. It is important to note that we define
mature attachment on an interactional basis, not as a property
of the overall relationship. This dynamic definition of attach-
ment and identity allows for the hallmark of the constructive
work of psychotherapy: the focus on "unique outcomes"
(White & Epston, 1990) or "sparkling moments" (Monk,
Winslade, Crocket, & Epston, 1996). Whether we are con-
ducting family therapy, individual therapy, or parent coun-
seling, we are constantly trying to "catch" those instances
when the young adult and parent are participating in more
mature interactions. We ceaselessly highlight these occur-
rences in the two previously described assessment catego-
ries: relational maturity and goal-directed action based in
autonomously held values.
6 SAGE Open
We actively scaffold adult identity by stimulating conver-
sations that involve principled negotiation, which is based on
accurate empathy of the other's interests and an appeal to the
merits of one's interests (Fisher & Ury, 1981). In contrast,
positional bargaining is descriptive of adolescent negotia-
tions in which the primary goal is to fend off threats to auton-
omy and exert as much control in the conflict as possible.
Parents tend to counter with a hierarchical, power-based
position. Unfortunately, these conversations gridlock the
family during this developmental stage. The transformation
to principled negotiation leads to autonomous relatedness
and "learning conversations" (Stone, Patton, & Heen, 1999).
To whatever extent the child defers to the parent's authority,
we try to highlight those instances when this deferential posi-
tion is expressed out of respect rather than compliance.
Ideally, when parents involve themselves in their child's
decisions, their involvement is invited, not enacted ex
cathedra.
Promoting self-authoring.The young adult is in a bind when
held captive by the pathogenic story. The effort that is required
to succeed in life is co-opted by the story that such effort is
defined as an expression of compliance and represents a loss
of autonomy. Therefore, we need to cultivate the adult child's
capacity to "author their own story" (Lieb & Kanofsky, 2003),
which is their ability to locate what they want their lives to
stand for and then actively pursue a life course that harmo-
nizes with these values. In our experience, there is a nascent
spark of self-authoring in even the lowest functioning young
adult. For instance, a young adult child with serious psychiat-
ric illness assiduously practiced guitar and began playing at
open mike nights. The parents of another young man only
saw that he slept past noon every day and could not see that
he was teaching himself computer programming. Our task is
to kindle the spark of self-motivation.
We often enrich the new description of the young adult
through questions. Questions are used to create new mean-
ing, not just to ascertain information (Freedman & Combs,
1996). For example, we might wonder aloud how the guitar-
playing young adult maintains such a rigorous and disci-
plined schedule. What qualities and knowledge are called
upon? What contributions did the parents make to the devel-
opment of these attributes? How does a person favorably
work with self-doubt? At the same time, from our middle-
aged perspectives, we see the low probability of financial
success with such an endeavor and do not deny the impor-
tance of career development. In working directly with young
adults, we utilize questions to create disequilibrium in their
entitled adolescent story. How does financial dependence
affect them? If they were writing a story, how would they
write a character where passionate enterprises were not at
odds with self-sufficiency? How would they engage their
parents in that story?
We also help parents actively promote their emerging
adult child's self-directed, value-based goals. We formally
train parents in motivational interviewing (Miller & Rollnick,
2002) to enhance their emerging adult child's autonomous
motivation, which appears to be an uncommon practice
(Smeerdijk et al., 2012). We find that motivational interview-
ing promotes a mastery conversation over a pathogenic one,
and the conversation leads to changes at both a behavioral
and identity level for parent and child.
Setting boundaries versus setting limits.At the same time,
autonomy support cannot be entirely permissive. Behavioral
responses to the child's enactment of his or her pathogenic
story must be established. However, by the time young adults
have reached their twenties, parents do not have many "con-
sequent cards" to play. Grounding a young adult would be as
appropriate as giving poker chips to a teenager for positive
behaviors. More importantly, giving consequences and set-
ting limits only maintain the adult-to-adolescent conversa-
tion. We do not favor abolishing the use of consequences, but
we believe it is essential that there is a paradigmatic shift in
the function of parental consequences. We want to change
the parental paradigm from setting limits to constrain the
child's maladaptive behavior to establishing boundaries to
honor their own "right to a life" now that their child is an
adult. This shift is an expression of a message that the quality
of their lives matters; they are not just an extension of the
young adult.
Pushing out of the nest.The greatest challenge in treating
young adults and their families is when the developmental
process is not appreciably moved forward by the aforemen-
tioned interventions. They are, essentially, "dying on the
vine." In these cases, the only remaining measure is to offer
the adult child a choice: either respect the parents' right to an
adult-to-adult relationship or leave the home. The context for
this action is its key to success. Done in anger, it is an act of
rejection. In contrast, we want the difficult step of ending co-
residence to represent a redefinition of attachment, not an act
of abandonment.
The most auspicious context for this dramatic inflection
point in the family's life cycle is founded in the previously
articulated components of the treatment model. Both parents
are now aligned around this course of action. The anxious/
worrying parent is capable of the internal work of tolerating
their anxious images of a despairing child, and the angry par-
ent is also able to "sit with" their discomfort and not act out
of these states. Most importantly, we need to consistently
reinforce that the parents are establishing their personal
boundaries, not setting limits to control the behavior of the
young adult. In line with the dictum to "think like a therapist
and act like a parent," we try to help them see that their
child's intractable stance is a form of passive-into-active
testing. They will not pass this test by increasing their protec-
tive actions, they will pass it by modeling that they can stand
up to feelings of helplessness and exploitation by taking care
of themselves, the same set of feelings the young adult is
Lieb and Auld 7
experiencing and unable to master. We believe the unfinished
adolescent unconsciously wants their parents to demonstrate
that they have a "right to a life" so they can claim this same
right for themselves. The stance expresses the message that
they want the young adult to emerge; they believe their child
is capable, and they are rooting for him or her.
The protocol we employ in these cases is fairly standard,
but nuanced based on each family's case-specific profile. A
number of factors must be taken into account for this inter-
vention to be successful. Therapists need to assess the par-
ents'capacity to tolerate anxiety, their financial situation, the
young adult's level of impairment, and, of course, their risk
for self-harm. It is very challenging to disentangle parental
anxiety, manipulation, and real intent when the young adult
is threatening self-harm if asked to leave. However, we can
mitigate these circumstances by creating the contexts
described above and by crafting safer solutions in which the
young adult is living alone.
For some families it is pro-plan to completely allow the
young adult child to find his or her own alternatives to co-
residence without providing any economic support. In other
families, particularly when there are concerns, real or imag-
ined, about potential for self-harm, it is pro-plan to initially
subsidize this move on a time-limited basis. Of course, a cer-
tain level of affluence is necessary to provide this kind of
support, which is the case for much of the population we
serve. Although such a move does not "fast track" the young
adult forward as efficiently as simply asking them to leave, it
does provide a softer landing and allows parents to sit with a
tolerable level of anxiety and guilt. In cases where a pro-
found mental health disturbance is present, parents must cali-
brate their expectations to their child's ability, which we
view as a form of narrative attunement.
In fact, it is our experience that, under these softer condi-
tions, all parties can tolerate, and even welcome, this move.
Parents should not provide any more than the essentials and
this financial support should either be paid directly, like the
rent, or given as food or public transportation cards so that
the young adult, who is often addicted, does not have the
cash to buy drugs. Still, living alone allows young adults to
directly experience the natural consequences of their devel-
opmental impasse outside of the static of the oppositional/
control struggles that have occluded that reality. Removed
from the family home, they are better able to appreciate the
unviability of their lifestyle and that they are not living rich,
value-based lives. Over time, usually a few months, we
advise the parents to retract their financial support and
increase expectations that the young adult become finan-
cially self-sufficient. In this way we scaffold the process.
Throughout this period of time, it is important that the
parents maintain their side of the adult-to-adult conversation.
We encourage them to express a "revolving door policy," in
which they state the young adult child is welcome to live in
the home contingent on the young adult's ability to engage
more fully in adult-to-adult conversations and interactions.
Evidence that this is the case comes from the quality of the
interactions as well as their actions. We advise parents to
calibrate the extent to which they reach out to the child based
on the response they get back. If the young adult continues to
respond with angry defiance, we believe he or she is coach-
ing the parents that parental nurturance cannot be accepted
without the young adult feeling dependent and anxious about
the relationship. In this way, we try to set up a "win-win"
situation in which the young adult is either emerging or is
increasingly dystonic with their limited life and asking for
help in a healthy way.
Conclusion
Eighteen- to twenty-nine-year-olds are increasingly deciding
to live with their family of origin rather than set up indepen-
dent households. The road to young adulthood is becoming
less a straightforward path toward independence and more a
"circular migration" (Goldscheider & Goldscheider, 1999)
as evidenced by the fact that the number of adult children
living at home after high school graduation has swelled in
the last generation. Roughly one quarter of adult children
between 20 and 34 years of age now live with their parents,
an increase of 7% in just the last 30 years (Qian, 2012).
Furthermore, this demographic shift may only be the first
wave of this trend as the Baby Boomers' 71 million children
reach young adulthood. In fact, this increased rate of co-
residence is twice as great in the younger range of that age
group with roughly half living at home for at least some
period of time after high school and almost a quarter living at
home for more than a year (Payne, 2012).
Incompletely launched emerging adults and the resulting
"cluttered nest" (Boyd & Pryor, 1989) in the family have
received much attention in professional journals as well as in
the popular culture. However, contrary to its depiction in
movies, the effect of co-residence on the mental health of
emerging adults appears not to be uniformly negative. For
some, co-residence seems to be beneficial and is associated
with less distress compared with emerging adults who con-
form to traditional expectations of in-time leaving (Lanz &
Tagliabue, 2007; Seiffge-Krenke, 2006). Certainly, co-resi-
dence provides financial benefits during current economic
conditions that seem to particularly disfavor employment
opportunities for young adults.
This adaptation works for those whose decision is
largely driven by financial considerations. For others, how-
ever, it seems to represent an impasse or delay on the devel-
opmental track of separation-individuation. In those
instances where we assess the primary problem is that the
individual is not living up to anachronistic cultural specifi-
cations, we need to disabuse parents of their worry. Their
pathologizing story of their 20-something child, which is
causing them such distress, needs to be revised to allow
them to engage their young adult child as an adult, not an
object of worry.

More problematic are those cases in which separation-
individuation pathology is central to the decision to not leave
home. In these cases, the young adult and his or her parents
are struggling to develop a new level of relational maturity
with each other. They are stuck in their old and familiar ado-
lescent patterns. These unfinished adolescents are having
difficulty becoming self-directed and orienting their devel-
opmental course toward autonomous, as opposed to parent-
controlled, values. Like a set of cogwheels, their parents
participate in this dysfunctional pattern by intensifying their
control-based parenting, which manifests as extreme worry
and/or anger. Together, at its extreme, this dynamic creates a
clinical nightmare.
The purpose of this article has been to provide working
clinicians, such as ourselves, with a roadmap showing them
how to effectively work with this challenging, and clearly
at-risk clinical population. Our local expertise is with the
community we serve, which is largely affluent and White.
However, we believe these treatment principles can be
applied regardless of the specific cultural context in which
young adulthood is being defined as long as the therapist is
facilitating pro-plan conversations that move the individual
and family into a developmental narrative that works in that
culture. Depending where the young adult is on the develop-
mental spectrum, we work with him or her individually, the
parents, or the family. Regardless of who is in the room, we
apply a theoretical model called constructivist control mas-
tery theory, which integrates a psychodynamic approach
with narrative therapy. Our treatment approach focuses on
targeting the conversation, not the individuals, for change.
Our therapeutic tasks are based on the assumption that iden-
tity is socially constructed and fluid. Therefore, we seek to
deconstruct, or collapse, the unviable elements of the narra-
tive that maintain adolescent identity and construct, or catch,
the emerging adult story of relational maturity and autono-
mous, goal-directed action. Our efforts are geared toward
enriching mastery-oriented interactions, behaviors, thoughts,
emotions, intentions, identities, and relationships that com-
prise the successful resolution of the developmental stage of
emerging adulthood. We believe our approach provides a
developmentally tailored intervention for the effective treat-
ment of co-residing emerging adults.
