Abstract
We provide firm-level evidence concerning four key facts of services trade in
Germany. First, not only firms classified as service firms, but also firms from
all industries export and import services. Second, service trade patterns are
fairly similar to those in goods trade. Most notably, service trade is dominated
by a few large firms that serve many countries, sell several service products,
and often export and import services. Differences in firms' trade values are
result from differences in all three margins of trade. Third, there is a strong
concentration of firms on one core market and service. Fourth, the patterns
are surprisingly similar for services exports and imports.
Keywords: service trade, firm heterogeneity, intensive and extensive margins
of trade

1 Introduction
Service trade has become an important topic in international economic policy
for at least two reasons. First, services play a continuously growing role in mod-
ern economies. The World Bank (2009) estimates that roughly 70% of global
value added in 2007 was generated in the services sector. With proceeding
economic development, a further increase of this share is rather likely. Second,
services are increasingly tradable due to technological advances 1 and deregu-
lation and liberalization policies. Growth rates in service trade have matched
those of trade in goods in the last two decades. In particular, business services
have contributed to this development. In 2007, world service exports stood at
$3,260 billion (WTO 2008), 2 constituting a 24% share of world trade. These
facts explain the ongoing efforts to organize liberalization in services trade in
the GATS, NAFTA and European Union to foster economic growth.
The literature on trade in services is quite sparse. Most empirical research and
theoretical considerations are related to trade in goods. We contribute to the
understanding of service trade by presenting a trade pattern at the firm level.
We want to encourage further research in this field, because we believe that
this is necessary to give guidance for future policy arrangements. We have
collected some new facts on the pattern of services trade in Germany at the
micro level. Many earlier studies of service trade (Fillat-Castej´
on et al. 2008,
Lennon 2007) rely on aggregated trade data. Differences at the firm level,
however, are aggregated away in studies at a higher level of aggregation.
We use a dataset that combines service trade through commercial presence

accounts abroad promoted of cross-border services imports of the US in the 90s.

tics and do not include sales through foreign affiliates.

in a foreign country (WTO mode 3) from the MIDI (MIcro data base Direct
Investment) dataset of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The other three modes as
defined by the WTO are as follows: cross-border supply (mode 1), trade via
consumption abroad (mode 2) and via temporary presence of service suppliers
abroad (mode 4) from the Balance of Payment Statistics (BoP). In sum, we
can rely on comprehensive information about German service trade. 3
Some important features that have been found to apply in the trade of man-
ufacturing goods in other studies (e.g., Bernard et al. 2007) apply also to the
service trade: (i) Only a small number of German service firms participates
in the services trade. (ii) Trading firms vary a lot concerning their trade val-
ues, with (iii) large firms strongly dominating trade. (iv) Most large firms do
both import and export services. (v) The dominance of large firms can be
explained by all the margins of trade. (vi) Finally, the patterns of the imports
are amazingly similar to those of the exports.
The dominance of a few large firms in trade has been found in goods trade
before. Mayer and Ottaviano (2007) and Manova and Zhang (2008) present
such evidence for manufacturing firms in several European countries and in
China, respectively. Manova and Zhang (2008) and Bernard et al. (2007) report
also that trade is dominated by firms that handle both import and export
goods and that all margins of trade contribute to the differences in firms'
trade. Thus, the service trade pattern that we report is very similar to the
pattern in goods trade. This is also found by Breinlich and Criscuolo (2008)
for service trade in the United Kingdom (UK).
The similarity to trade in goods holds also true for the positive relationship
of the different margins of trade. We distinguish two extensive margins, one

ports comparable.

concerning the number of countries traded with and one concerning the num-
ber of traded products, and the intensive margin. The extensive margin with
respect to the number of products requires activities of multi-product firms
as modeled by Mayer et al. (2008) and Bernard et al. (2006). They develop
models with multi-product firms that face a firm-specific productivity and
product-specific capabilities or expertise. These firm and product characteris-
tics lead to a positive relationship between the number of products traded and
the volume of sales, because more productive firms can sell more products and
larger volumes of a given product. Arkolakis and Muendler (2009) use a simi-
lar model, with fixed costs for entering a foreign market and variable costs for
placing a product, to study the export of Brazilian manufacturers. They find a
positive relationship between product range and sales per product for a given
destination. We investigate the relationship between the margins of service
trade and find a similar relationship in our data, although the interrelation of
all three margins is a bit more complex.
Additionally, we find a strong within-firm concentration of trade on a few
markets and services. Such a concentration has already been found by Brein-
lich and Criscuolo (2008) for firms from the UK. Even firms that trade with
many countries and trade many different services tend to concentrate their
activities in only a few markets and services. Heterogenous firm models based
on monopolistic competition are very helpful in organizing ideas about the
relationship of the different margins, but they can explain the strong con-
centration of exporters in one or very few foreign markets only with relatively
strong assumptions. The enormous concentration on the import side challenges
the assumption of monopolistic competition even more.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we give
a description of the dataset we are using in the analysis. In Section 3, we
3
analyze the differences in service trade flows across service product groups and
across the sectors of the trading firms. Section 4 examines firm-level differences
concerning the volume of sales, the number of services supplied abroad, and the
number of countries served. In Section 5, we document the great dominance
of the most important market even for large "global and diversified" firms. In
the last section, we conclude and discuss some issues for further research.
2 Data Description
We merge two confidential micro-level datasets from the Deutsche Bundes-
bank, which contain nearly the whole population of German services exporters
and importers. The first dataset records service transactions between residents
and non-residents, collected to compile the BoP-Statistics. For every service
transaction between a German resident firm and a non-resident, with a value
higher than 12,500 Euros, firms report to the Deutsche Bundesbank their sec-
tor classification, the partner country, the kind of transaction they conducted,
and the value of the transaction (Deutsche Bundesbank 2009). These transac-
tions include GATS modes 1, 2, and 4. We combine all service trade activities
in this first dataset in the cross-border trade category.
Every reporting firm in the BoP-Statistics has been given a firm identifier
from the Bundesbank. The same identifier is used in the MIDI dataset. The
MIDI dataset provides a detailed breakdown of the foreign assets and liabil-
ities of German multinational firms abroad and German affiliates of foreign
multinational firms (Lipponer 2009). 4 The database contains information on
4 German foreign direct investment is there defined as direct or indirect ownership
or control by a single German entity of at least ten percent of the voting rights
or capital shares of an incorporated foreign firm or the equivalent interest in an
unincorporated foreign firm. The same criteria define a German affiliate of a foreign
investor.
4
all foreign affiliates of German multinational firms, and on German affiliates
of foreign multinational firms if they exceed the rather low reporting limit.
The comprehensive database includes the balance-sheet data of foreign affil-
iates, including their sales, employment, and total assets in each of over 200
destinations. It also includes information on both the sector of activity of the
parent firm and the affiliate at the NACE rev-1 two- or three-digit level. The
data covers foreign affiliates' activities between 1989 and 2007. However, infor-
mation for the parent company is limited to German parents and is available
only since 2002.
Sales of service affiliates from the MIDI database are exports and imports by
commercial presence (mode 3). One problem with this kind of data, which
is known as "Foreign Affiliate Trade Statistics" (FATS) in the literature, is
that we know only the sector classification of an affiliate and its total sales.
There is no differentiation between different services or goods that are sold
by the affiliate. On the one hand, therefore we overestimate the service sales
of an affiliate in a specific product group, because it is very unlikely that an
affiliate sells only services according to the group in which it is classified. Yet,
on the other hand, we underestimate trade because we also do not account
for sales of a particular service by affiliates that are classified in a different
sector. Despite these underlying problems, the OECD (2008a) concludes that
FATS data is the best we have and is preferable to estimating service trade
by commercial presence using FDI stock or flow data.
We split our service trade data into eleven service sectors, which are listed
in Table 1 and which represent mainly producer services. The first seven sec-
tors are at the two-digit level. The last four are business services that we
split into management services, advertising, personnel services, and holding
activities using the three-digit level classification. We aggregate the values of
5
each firm's cross-border trade transactions for all combinations of firm, year,
kind of service trade (export or import), and partner country from the trade
database to match the structure of the observations from the MIDI database.
The aggregation is necessary, because the sector classification of the foreign
affiliates in the MIDI is more aggregated than for the services traded in the
BoP-Statistics. Furthermore, there is no distinction between different transac-
tions with customers of an affiliate. Table 14 in the appendix gives an overview
of the kind of services included in both datasets and the matching of the data.
The matching aims at obtaining the highest level of disaggregation possible
with the two datasets.
We use data for 2005 in the entire paper to describe the basic pattern of service
trade involving German firms at the micro level. Combining both datasets we
can make use of 165,815 observations concerning service trade, which can differ
along five dimensions: the firm, the type of service group traded, the trade
mode (cross-border or commercial presence), the kind of transaction (export
or import), and the partner country. Cross-border imports comprise the largest
group with respect to the number of observations (124,768), followed by cross-
border exports (36,239), sales of foreign affiliates of German firms (3,421), and
German affiliates of foreign firms (1,387). Many firms are involved in foreign
activities using more than one channel.
For the analysis at the sector and at the firm level, we use a sample with
18,004 cross-border importers, 5,058 cross-border exporters, and 542 German
parent firms. 5 Table 1 shows trade values and the number of firms engaged in
trade aggregated for the different trade modes. In 2005, the 542 German par-
ents exporting services through their foreign affiliates had aggregated affiliate
5 We reduce the sample by dropping holding services, because it is not so clear what
exactly these services are.

service sales of 216 billion Euros (column 7). Affiliates' service sales were more
than twice as large as the cross-border supply, which amounted to 86.5 billion
Euro (column 3). Affiliates sales abroad were also higher than were foreign
firms' German affiliates' sales (90.0 billion Euros, column 8), roughly equaling
the 88.3 billion Euro aggregate cross-border service imports (column 5).
Unfortunately, we cannot conduct an analysis of total service imports at a
disaggregated level, because we do not have information about the buyers of
the services supplied by the German affiliates of foreign multinationals. We
therefore drop imports through commercial presence from our further analysis
and use only cross-border trade data for comparing imports and exports. On
the export side, we can analyze both cross-border exports and those using
a commercial presence in the foreign country. We highlight the important
differences in the results for total and cross-border exports along the study.
German firms trade services with more than 200 countries and territories.
The ten most important trading partners are ranked in Table 2 according to
their share in total service exports and imports, including all modes. The ten
countries account for roughly 65% of total exports and 80% of total imports.
3 Sector Analysis
In this section, we examine whether there are any regularities in service trade
at the sector level. We distinguish two ways to aggregate service trade to
the sector level: (i) according to the characteristics of the service traded and
(ii) according to the classification of the trading firms. In the first step, we
investigate export participation and intensities in ten different service product
groups. In the second step, we analyze trade concerning the role of firms from

different industries.
Information about the export participation of German firms and the impor-
tance of foreign markets is presented in Table 3. Export values refer to cross-
border exports. We report the number of firms classified in the different sectors
in Germany in column 6 and their production values in column 7 from the
Statistical Yearbook 2008. 6 Based on these values, we calculate the participa-
tion ratio in column 4 as the share of exporters of a particular service product
(column 2) in all firms in the sector (column 6). Export intensities in column
5 are derived by dividing cross-border exports (column 3) by the production
in Germany (column 7).
Note a conceptual issue concerning Table 3. The number of exporters and the
exports are lower than in Table 1. The reason is that we include only firms
with the same sector classification with respect to the traded product and the
classification of the trading firm. For instance, R&D exports of R&D firms
are included, but transport service exports of these firms are not. In some

but does not account for affiliate sales. Thus, it serves as a rough proxy for service
sales in the different German service sectors.

sectors, that causes a serious bias. R&D exporters, for example, come from
all industries, particularly from manufacturing. Nevertheless, we include only
firms exporting in the same sector to achieve comparability to the numbers
from the statistical yearbook, which is organized according to the classification
of the firm and not according to the product. 7
We want to highlight three results from Table 3. First, the average export
participation ratio (0.14%) is fairly low in services trade (column 4). This low
trade participation matches results from earlier studies in manufacturing. For
instance, Bernard et al. (2007) find that 3.1% of U.S. manufacturers exported
and 2.2% imported goods in 2000. Vogel and Wagner (2010) find an export
participation of 16% for German business services, but they neglect firms with
total sales below 250,000 Euros, which leads to an upward bias in their results.
Our values are downward biased, on the one side, by the notification threshold
7 The import side is neglected because we do not know to whom the German affil-
iates of foreign multinational firms sell.
10
of 12,500 Euros per transaction in the BoP-Statistics and, on the other side,
because we account only for firms that export the services according to their
sector classification.
Second, export intensities in the analyzed sectors are much higher than the
participation rates. The average export intensity over all sectors (excluding
Insurance for data reasons) is 4.9% (column 5). 8 This implies that average
exports per service exporter are relatively large compared to average domestic
sales per firm. Third, export participation and intensity differ a lot among
services. Participation rates range from nearly 0.0% for Management Services
to 11.6% for Insurance. Export intensity is nearly 0.0% for Personnel Services
and 8.0% in the R&D sector. These sector differences might arise from differ-
ent reasons such as differences in comparative advantages, tradability of the
services, or the mismatch in the classification of products and firms discussed
above.
Next we present the sector aggregation with respect to the firm that trades
the service. Information about service trade in ten German sector groups is
collected in Table 4 and 5. The analysis is mostly restricted to cross-border
trade to facilitate comparability between exports and imports. In Table 5, we
also include exports through foreign affiliates.
The second column in Table 4 shows the value of the cross-border exports of
a particular sector group. The third column presents the fraction of service
exports conducted by this group in total cross-border exports. The fourth
column gives the share of cross-border exports conducted by firms that do
both export and import of services (E+I firms) in percent. The fifth, sixth,
and seventh columns present the same information as the second, third, and
8 When we also account for service traders from other sectors, the participation
ratio increases to 1.0% and export intensity to 13.9%, on average.

fourth columns do for imports, respectively.
Firms from all sectors export and import services. In sector-specific analyses
of service trade it seems, therefore, more important than for trade in goods to
account for the sector of the trading firm. Nevertheless, service firms account
for the majority of service exports and imports. The three sector groups Trans-
port; Finance, Insurance & Communication; and Business, R&D & Computer
account together for more than 56% of cross-border exports (column 3) and
50% of cross-border imports (column 5). When holdings and other service
firms are also taken into account, this share increases to roughly 70% and
75%, respectively.
The share of manufacturing firms is also very sizeable, with nearly 25% in
total service exports and roughly 27% for imports. While we expected a share

like this for the import side, the 25% for cross-border service exports is higher
than we expected. Breinlich and Criscuolo (2008) find a share of 12% for
manufacturing firms in both exports and imports for the United Kingdom,
using a slightly different composition of services in their analysis. The higher
share of manufacturing in Germany might be due to the larger importance
of the manufacturing industry for the Germany economy. Table 5 shows that
the share of the manufacturers for exports would be smaller than 10% if we
also accounted for exports through foreign affiliates (column 3). Service firms
export more often through foreign affiliates and have, on average, larger sales
abroad if compared to manufacturers.
Firms that both export and import services account for a surprisingly high
share of total cross-border exports and imports. The share stands at 97.2%
for exports and 83.5% for imports (Table 4). Breinlich and Criscuolo (2008)
13
obtain a similar value for imports (86.4%), but a slightly lower one (79.8%)
for exports. Table 5 shows that the share of E+I firms decreases to 69.7% for
exports (column 5) and 19.6% for imports (column 7) when the number of
firms instead of the sales is considered.
4 Firm-level Differences
In the last section, we collected new facts about service export participation
and trade values at the sector level. However, Eaton et al. (2004) report that
export participation and export values in goods trade are more strongly af-
fected by firm than by sector characteristics. In this section, we therefore look
at differences at the firm-level. Although we have information only on firms
that participate in trade, this group by itself is not composed of symmet-
ric firms. In the first subsection, we study the heterogeneity in the values of
exports and imports, in their intensive margin, and in their two extensive
margins. In the second subsection, we analyze the relationship between the
margins more deeply using multivariate regressions.
4.1 Concentration of Trade
To analyze trade at the firm level, we aggregate the exports and imports of
each firm over all sectors and partner countries, and rank firms according to
their sales in deciles. We find striking differences among the trading firms
with respect to trade values. These differences can result from (i) differences
in the value of trade of a particular service with a particular country (intensive
margin), (ii) the number of countries traded with (the extensive margin with
respect to countries), and (iii) the number of services traded (extensive margin

with respect to products).
Table 6 lists the sum of cross-border exports (unweighted), average firm ex-
ports per sector-country combination, average number of countries served, and
average number of service groups traded by a particular firm for each decile.
These figures show a strong increase of total sales per firms in the higher
deciles. Certainly, the increase is by construction, because we grouped the
firms with the lowest exports in decile 1. Yet, the increase is impressive: the
firms in the 10th decile account for nearly 91% of cross-border exports (col-
umn 3). The ten largest exporters, roughly 0.2% of firms, account for around
40% of cross-border exports. 9
Similar results can be found for service imports in Table 7: 10% of cross-
border importers, which are the largest firms, account for 93% (column 3) of
total cross-border imports. The top 100 or 0.5% of the importers, account for
roughly 60% of imports. Thus, large firms strongly dominate trade in services
in Germany, for imports and for exports.
9 We even find a slightly stronger concentration of sales for total exports. The firms
in the tenth decile account for more than 95% of total exports.

Comparing cross-border exports and imports, we find that, on average, im-
porters trade more products: 1.7 compared to 1.4 for exports. In contrast,
the average number of partner countries is larger for exports (5.8) than for
imports (4.2). The intensive margin of trade (column 4) is more than three
times larger on the export side. Columns 4-6 in Tables 4 and 5 show that the
strong increase of trade volumes in the upper deciles can be explained by an
increase of all three margins for both imports and exports: firms with larger
imports or exports have larger average trade volumes in a given country and
sector, trade with more countries, and trade services from more groups.
The intensive margin shows impressive differences for exports and for imports.
For instance, average imports per country and product group by a firm in the
fifth decile (77,700 Euro), for instance, are 7 times larger than the sales of a
firm in the first decile (11,100 Euro), but only 5% of the sales of a firm in the
tenth decile (2,375,100 Euro). 10
10 Cross-border exports in the tenth decile are 400 times larger than in the first,
where cross-border imports are 210 times larger. When we consider total exports
(cross-border and commercial presence), sales in the tenth decile are more than
3,500 times larger than in the first decile.

Table 8 shows the extensive margins for cross-border exports. Apparent is
a strong concentration of exports on the few firms in the highest category.
The 49 firms that export to more than 50 countries account for almost half
of the exports, although they are only about 1% of all exporters. On the
other end of the distribution, we have many exporters that export to just
one country. These firms account for only a small share of German service
exports. The dominance of the highest category with respect to the number
of services supplied is less pronounced. The 38 firms exporting more than 5
product groups account for more than 10% of the exports. 11
Table 9 displays similar results for cross-border imports. The 81 importers that
import from more than 50 countries, roughly 0.5% of the firms, account for
nearly 50% of German service imports. Similarly, the 483 firms importing from
more than five product groups account for almost half of the imports. Thus,
services trade in Germany is dominated by globally engaged, multi-product
firms.
11 Considering total exports further strengthens the dominance of large firms.

To assess the role of the different margins in explaining the differences in firm
sales, we simply regress the three margins on total firm sales in three different
OLS regressions in log-log form. The intensive margin on the firm level is
calculated as in Tables 6 and 7: the average trade volume per sector-country
combination on the firm level. The results for cross-border exports and imports
in the six different regressions are presented in Table 10. All coefficients are
significant at the 1%-level. The coefficient is highest for the intensive margin
(column 2) followed by the number of partner countries (column 3) and the
number of service types traded (column 4). Breinlich and Criscuolo (2008)
find similar results for firms in the UK. The coefficient of the intensive margin
is slightly higher for cross-border exports than for cross-border imports.
The small coefficient of the number of services traded is probably due to the
high aggregation level of the service groups in our data, which leads to low
variation of this variable (particularly for exports) as shown in Tables 6 and
7. Bernard et al. (2006) use goods trade data at the 10-digit level and find a
stronger positive effect from the number of products exported on the intensive

margin of exports than we find here. In addition to the level of aggregation,
another explanation for the differences in the results may be differences in
fixed costs. Providing an additional service in a foreign market might be more
expensive than exporting an additional good. This idea is proposed by the
OECD (2008b).
4.2 Margins of Service Trade
After having studied the three margins explaining the differences in firms'
trade values, we now analyze their correlation. According to the theory sketched
in the introduction, the relationship should be positive. The correlation be-
tween the two extensive margins is positive and significant at the 1% level.
The correlation coefficient for cross-border imports (0.48) is larger than for
cross-border exports (0.28) and total exports (0.3).
To analyze the relationship between the intensive margin and the extensive
margins, we run log-log regressions for the value of trade in every given firm-
sector-country combination on the two extensive margins. This has the advan-
tage that we can control for country and sector biases by including country
and sector dummies. Additionally, we include a dummy variable for the sector
19
of the trading firms.
Running separate regressions for the extensive margins, we obtain, in line with
theory, positive coefficients that are significant at the 1% level for both margins
and for imports and exports. The explanatory power of Internationality, the
number of partner countries, is larger compared to Diversity, the number of
service products traded. 12 The results become more complex when we include
both margins in one regression, as can be seen in Table 11. We find that
Internationality still has a positive impact on the trade values of a firm for both
cross-border imports and exports as well as for total exports. The coefficients
of Internationality are significantly larger than zero at the 1% level in all
columns in Table 11.
For Diversity, we obtain significantly negative coefficients. As a robustness
check we split the sample in manufacturing and service firms and run separated
regressions for total exports. The results are presented in columns 5 and 6.
The coefficient of Diversity is significantly negative for manufacturers (column
5). For service firms, however, it is positive, although insignificant (column 6).
Arkolakis and Muendler (2009) find as well, both theoretically and empirically,
that there is not necessarily a positive relationship between a firm`s Diversity
and its intensive margin.
The Affiliate-Dummy in columns 4-6, which is set to one if the export is
conducted by a foreign affiliate, is highly significant in the regressions for
total exports and has a large positive coefficient. Obviously, trade volumes
are much larger when firms choose commercial presence as their export mode.
Moreover, columns 2 and 3 report that firms which both import and export
have larger intensive margins: the exporter dummy in column 3 and importer
12 This result concerns both the size of the coefficients and the adjusted residual
square sum.

dummy in column 2 are positive and significant at the 1% level. This supports
the evidence from Table 4 that E+I firms dominate trade. One reason for this
dominance is a larger intensive margin. Additionally, we include a dummy
that indicates whether a firm is a German multinational (Outward MNE) or
if it belongs to a foreign multinational (Inward MNE). Both type of firms have
larger cross-border trade, with German MNEs having particularly high trade
levels.
This section highlighted the high concentration of sales in a few (large) firms
and the role of the different margins to explain the heterogeneity among firms
that trade services. We found that all three margins of adjustment contribute
to this heterogeneity. The analysis has mainly focused on the averages of the
margins across firms. Yet, so far we have said nothing about the distribution
of sales across different trading partner countries and traded services within

a single trading firm. The following section therefore analyzes the within-firm
concentration of trade activities in particular markets.
5 Composition of Trade Within Firms
In this section, we illustrate to what extent firms' trade activities are concen-
trated on the most important partner countries or service products. We find
that there is not only a large concentration of trade activities in a few firms,
but also a pronounced concentration of trade within these firms.
To show this, we calculate the market share of cross-border export and import
values in the first, second, and third important partner country of a particular
firm. We average this firm-specific market share for all firms and present the
result in column 2 of Table 12. Columns 3, 4, and 5 give the average market
share for all firms that have exactly 5, 15, and 40 partner countries, respec-
tively. This gives us the average relative importance of a single country and
service for the total trade value of a firm.

The shares of the most important market are very high for both exports and
imports. For a firm with 15 partner countries, the most important market
accounts for an impressive 44% of the exports and 43% of the imports (column
4). For comparison, note that the average market share is 6.7%. Even an
exporter with 40 partner countries (average market share 2.5%) exports 41%
of all services to its most important partner country (column 5). The three
most important destinations account for 68% of all exports. An importer with
40 partner countries buys 27% of all services from its most important and 59%
from its three most important source countries.
We find that concentration is even more pronounced with respect to the num-
ber of service groups in which a firm trades. We show this in Table 13, which
is organized as Table 12 above, but which contains information about the
concentration of firms' trade in the three most important product groups.
The concentration in the most important product group is high. Breinlich and
Criscuolo (2008) find similar results for the trade of firms in the UK. While
concentration with respect to both products and partner countries is, on the
export side, in line with models where a single or multi-service producer sells
23
services to different markets that differ in market size and trade barriers, the
high concentration on the import side is more puzzling.
6 Conclusion
We present an empirical overview on service trade at the micro level. We
combine two datasets compiled by the Deutsche Bundesbank: the Balance
of Payments Statistics and the MIcro database Direct Investment to create
a dataset that includes all service exports of German firms and all service
imports to Germany. We show that rather few firms trade services. The differ-
ences between the sectors are sizable, but much less pronounced than within
sector differences between firms. The bulk of exports and imports are concen-
trated in few global and diversified firms. All three margins of trade contribute
to this concentration. But even within these firms, activities are very much
concentrated on one partner country and service group.
Furthermore, we find some evidence that the intensive and extensive margins
of trade are positively linked at the firm level, but we identify some differences
between manufacturers and service firms. Additionally, the number of service
products exported seems to have a weaker correlation to the intensive margin,
as it does in goods trade.
We see three main issues for future research arising from the analysis. First, the
high share of non-service firms and particular manufacturing firms in services
trade deserves a more detailed analysis. Moreover, the analysis of the different
margins of trade reveals that the determinants of service trade may be different
for firms from manufacturing.
Second, the high concentration of trade in firms that are both importing and
24
exporting deserves further research. Taking the first steps in this direction,
Breinlich and Criscuolo (2008) find that employment, capital-intensity, or
productivity are larger for firms that both import and export. Bernard et
al. (2007) propose increasing international fragmentation of production as a
possible reason for the dominance of firms with export and import activities.
They argue that there is a positive effect on the export activities of firms
from reducing their costs by offshoring. Amiti and Wei (2006) find that in
the last decade, offshoring of business activities has not only been sizable, but
has also contributed significantly to the increase in productivity in developed
countries.
Third, the large concentration at the firm-level is particularly surprising for
imports, for which empirical evidence and theoretical considerations are still
scarce. It seems as if service imports are channeled through a few large firms.
But if both the export side and the import side is so strongly concentrated,
models of perfect and also of monopolistic competition probably do not de-
scribe trade appropriately. Strategic interaction and monopolistic behavior
might play a much larger role than the models suggest. The concentration on
the import side is particularly hard to explain in the frameworks that model
consumers on the buyers side. The data, in contrast, point to a "business-to-
business" relationship in service trade.
This is not just an academic point. Market structure heavily influences the
welfare effects of trade liberalization. Raff and Schmitt (2009) make this point
in a model showing the buyer power of importers. Welfare gains from lower
trade costs are thereby strongly reduced by the buyer's power. Thus, it is
important to understand the import behavior of firms more deeply in order to
give profound guidance for further liberalization of trade in producer services.
