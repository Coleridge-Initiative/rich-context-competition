This article examines the impact of open market share repurchase announcements on
stock returns in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The main objective is to examine
whether share repurchase announcements under the open market route have any
significant impact on the returns of the stocks traded in the BSE. The article covers the
period from 2009 to 2013. For sample selection, two criteria were used: first, the firm
should have been listed in the BSE for at least 28 trading days before the repurchase
announcement date, and second, the firm should have all relevant data required by this
study.Atotal of 95 repurchase announcements fulfilled these criteria. The analysis period
extended from ­28 to +28 trading days relative to the repurchase announcement date
(t = 0). The findings of the study will help us to understand how the market responds
to share repurchase announcements in India and whether a firm actually benefits by
repurchasing its own shares from the market.
This study uses a standard event methodology based on an ordinary least squares
market model with the aim of finding out whether repurchase announcements generate
any abnormal return around the repurchase announcement date. While applying the
market model for estimating the abnormal returns, the regression is estimated based on
the stock return of the firm and market return of the previous 120 trading days. So, here
the estimation window takes into account 120 observations. Using this, the expected
returns are generated and then the abnormal returns are derived for the event window,
28 days prior to the event date and 28 days after the event date.
The findings of the study indicate that share repurchase announcements do not neces-
sarily generate abnormal stock returns in the Indian equity market unlike developed
economies like the US, Canada, and Australia. The whole sample is further divided
into various subsamples on the basis of firm size and size of repurchase. The subsample
analyses reveal that smaller firms do not necessarily experience higher abnormal stock
returns following repurchase announcements than that of the larger firms. The findings
weakly support the view that larger repurchase size generates greater abnormal stock
returns than the smaller ones.

Summary
436 ANOMALOUS PRICE BEHAVIOUR AROUND OPEN MARKET STOCK REPURCHASE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN INDIA
Share repurchase (hereinafter referred to as
repurchase) by companies first originated in
the US in the late 1960s, and assumed wide
popularity by mid-1980s. This corporate practice is
very much popular in the US, Canada, and the UK.
The explicit motives behind share repurchases by
firms include returning surplus cash to shareholders,
increasing promoters' stake, improving earnings per
share, reducing takeover threats, and most importantly,
preventing undervaluation of shares in the stock market.
India recognized this corporate practice in the financial
year 1998­1999, when Indian companies were allowed
to repurchase their own shares for the first time. In India,
firms can repurchase their own shares from the market
by following the Open Market Method or they can buy
their shares back by using the Tender Offer Method.
However, unlike developed countries like the US or
Canada, the number of repurchase announcements
has been very low in India since its inception. But in
the recent past, an upward rising trend in the share
repurchase programme has been evident in the Indian
corporate sector.
Share repurchase is believed to inject some buoyancy
into stock prices since the repurchase price is set
at a level higher than the prevailing market price
and, thus, it is considered as an essential measure to
`rescue a plunging stock market' (Liao, Ke, & Yu, 2005).
Preventing undervaluation of stocks in the market is
considered to be one of the most prominent objectives
behind share repurchases. Most of the Indian firms
report on their repurchase offer documents that the
main objective behind share repurchase is to prevent
undervaluation of their shares in the market. Through
share repurchase, a firm conveys a signal to the market
that presently its share is being undervalued in the
market but the firm expects its share price to increase.
Does this signalling really work? Some US and
Canadian market based studies document that share
repurchase announcements reflect positive information
to the market. Dann (1981), Vermaelen (1981), Netter
and Mitchell (1989), and Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and
Vermaelen (1995, 2000) find a significant positive market
reaction to the stock repurchases announcements.
In this backdrop, this study attempts to examine
whether share repurchase announcements under
the open market route have any significant impact
on returns of the stocks traded in the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE). The findings of the study will help
us to understand how the market responds to share
repurchase announcements in India and whether a firm
actually benefits by repurchasing its own shares from
the market. The findings show that share repurchase
announcements by Indian firms in the BSE do not
certainly increase their share prices in the market.
The entire sample is further divided into subsamples
based on firm size and size of repurchase
announcements. Empirical results show that the smaller
firms do not always experience greater abnormal stock
returns following share repurchase announcements
compared to the larger firms. With regard to the size
of repurchase and stock price reaction, our results
find that firms with larger repurchase size experience
greater abnormal stock returns than firms with smaller
size of share repurchase.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Majority of the studies on share repurchases have been
conducted in the developed economies like the US,
Canada, and the UK. Several studies have examined
the underlying motives behind share repurchase
announcement, and the most common motives
emerging out of those studies are returning surplus
cash to shareholders, capital structure redesign, anti-
takeover mechanism, and the application of preferential
tax rates (Liao et al., 2005). Badrinath and Varaiya
(2000), Western and Siu (2002), Financial Executive
Internationals (1999), etc., also report similar motives
behind share repurchase announcements.
However, in reality, the principal reason behind share
repurchase is to prevent undervaluation of share
prices in the market. Dann (1981), Vermaelen (1984),
Netter and Mitchell (1989), and Comment and Jarrell
(1991) find support of the undervaluation hypothesis and
observe significant positive abnormal returns around
repurchase announcement period in the US. Comment
and Jarrell (1991) document that during the period of
announcement, abnormal returns are highest under the
tender offer method of share repurchase and lowest
under the open market repurchase method, indicating
that the tender offer method is more informative for the
market. Ikenberry et al. (1995, 2000) and Balachandran
and Troiano (2000) also support the undervaluation
theory. Liao et al. (2005) observe significant negative
abnormal returns in most of the days prior to the
announcement day and significant positive abnormal
returns on the announcement day and during the
first few days of the post-announcement period in the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2015 437
On the other hand, Eberhart and Siddique (2004) find
lack of consistent evidence of positive stock returns
following repurchase announcements, and opine that
liquidity change is the dominating factor in explaining
announcement period's abnormal stock returns.
Cook, Krigman, and Leach (2004) also find support to
the liquidity hypothesis. Chatterjee and Rakshit (2008)
observe that the positive influence of share repurchase
on stock price is not prevalent in the Indian context in
all the repurchase cases as hypothesized theoretically.
An analysis of share repurchases during 1999­2003
in India shows that the actual repurchase price is less
than one half of the maximum price in nearly 50 per
cent of the cases analysed (Gupta, Jain, & Kumar, 2005).
Hertzel (1991) reports that repurchase announcements
had little or no effect on the share price of rival firms; the
information contained in repurchase announcements is
primarily company specific.
The regulatory framework around the share
repurchase activity varies across countries and has
significant impact on this activity from different
angles. Repurchase announcement during changes in
the regulatory framework governing share repurchase
is linked to positive but statistically insignificant
abnormal returns, which is contrary to the evidence
of American firms and the researchers are of the view
that this is possibly because of the overregulated
share repurchase environment in Australia (Harris
& Ramsay, 1995). Rau and Vermaelen (2002)
observe that the form and intensity of the share
repurchase activity in the UK is influenced by the tax
consequences associated with pension funds. The UK
firms earn smaller excess returns through repurchase
announcements compared to the US firms primarily
because of the regulatory provisions in the UK which
make it less likely that the firms can disseminate
superior information to repurchase shares under the
situation of undervaluation of stock prices.
As pointed out earlier, while several studies have been
conducted on share repurchase and its implications on
themarketaswellasonthefirmsannouncingrepurchase,
most of the studies have been conducted in developed
nations like the US, the UK, Canada, and Australia. In
India, this area has remained under-researched. There
is lack of in-depth studies on this corporate activity and
its implications for the Indian corporate and the market
at large. This article is expected to fill up this gap by
contributing to the existing literature with a primary
focus on the impact of open market stock repurchase
announcement on stock returns.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
In India, firms can repurchase their shares either by
the tender offer method or through the open market
route. Under the tender offer method, a firm commits
to repurchase a specific number of shares from the
shareholders either at a fixed price or at a price that is
arrived at through the book-building process. Under
the open market route, firms repurchase their shares
from the stock market. Here the repurchasing firm does
not commit to buy a specific number of shares and also
there is no commitment on the part of the company
regarding the minimum repurchase price. Only the
maximum price for repurchase is announced. The
actual price may vary. The maximum size of repurchase
is limited to 25 per cent of the total paid up capital and
reserves of the firm. This study considers only open
market repurchase programmes.
The study covered the period from 2009 to 2013.1 For
sample selection, two criteria were used: first, the firm
should have been listed in the BSE for at least 28 trading
days before the repurchase announcement date; and
second, the firm should have all relevant data required
by this study. A total of 95 repurchase programmes
fulfilled these criteria. The analysis period extended
from ­28 to +28 trading days relative to the repurchase
announcement date (t = 0).
This study covered all the repurchase announcements
made through the open market route. The data on
market return was based on S&P BSE 500, which
was sourced from the official website of the BSE. The
reason for considering S&P BSE 500 instead of Sensex
for computing market return was that most of the
repurchasing firms were not part of the Sensex and
they mostly belonged to the BSE small-cap and the
BSE mid-cap category. The information on repurchase
announcements were collected from the SEBI website.
The share price data of the sample firms were collected
from the BSE website. Table 1 presents the summary
statistics related to the repurchases.
Table 1 shows that 2009 has the highest number (36)
of repurchase announcements. The amount of share
repurchase as a percentage of paid-up capital and
free reserves ranges between 2.97 per cent and 25 per
cent over the period of study. The average buyback
size shows a reduction in 2010 (`426.71 million) from
the year before (`875.38 million) and then again
a substantial increase in the year 2011 (`1,864.72)
million. Thereafter, a declining trend is evident. In
438 ANOMALOUS PRICE BEHAVIOUR AROUND OPEN MARKET STOCK REPURCHASE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN INDIA
this context, it is worth noting that almost all the
repurchasing firms have disclosed `maximizing
shareholders value' as the primary objective behind
their repurchase announcements.
This study used the standard event methodology
based on the ordinary least squares (OLS) market
model2 with the aim of finding out whether repurchase
announcements generated any abnormal return around
the repurchase announcement date.
In a market model, under the assumption that
asset returns are jointly multivariate normal and
independently and identically distributed through
time, the model is correctly specified. This model
establishes a linear relationship between the market
return and the individual stock return and that follows
from joint normality.

From Equation 1,

Thereafter, using these estimates, abnormal returns for
security `j' at time `t' in the event window is computed as:
 AR R R

  (2)
Finally, average abnormal returns (AARs) and
cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) were computed
based on these abnormal returns.
In the market model, the expected return is estimated
by regressing the firm's stock return on market return.
The abnormal return is then derived as the difference
between this expected return and the actual return.
While applying the market model for estimating the
abnormal returns, the regression is estimated based on
the data of the firm and market return of the previous
120 trading days. So, here, the estimation window took
into account 120 observations. Using this, the expected
returns were generated and then the abnormal returns
were derived for the event window, 28 days prior to the
event date and 28 days after the event date. Here the
event date was the announcement date (t = 0). Before
starting the analysis, all the series were tested for
stationarity using the Phillips­Peron unit root test. As
expected, both the returns were found to be stationary.
The analysis is presented in two ways. First, the
effect of the repurchase announcement around
the announcement date was measured. To achieve
this objective, daily AARs for all stock repurchase
announcements were computed over ­28 and +28
trading days in response to the announcement date 0.
For each of the days prior to and post announcement,
the hypothesis that return is significantly different from
zero was tested. In addition to that the CARs were also
computed over different window ranges. Next, the

entire sample was divided into subsamples based on
the size of the firm and the size of repurchase in order to
examine whether abnormal returns around repurchase
announcement varied with the firm size and the size of
the repurchase. Therefore, the hypothesis that there is
difference in abnormal returns between the categories
(firm size and size of repurchase) was also tested. For
firm size, firms were categorized according to their
market capitalization. If market capitalization of the
firm at the time of repurchases announcement fell below
`2,000 crore, it was categorized as small-cap. If it was
between `2,000 and 10,000 crore, it was called mid-cap;
and if the market capitalization exceeded `10,000
crore, the firm was classified as large-cap. For size of
repurchase, firms were classified as top 25 percentile
and bottom 25 percentile and also top 50 percentile
and bottom 50 percentile firms based on the repurchase
size, defined as the proposed amount to be used for
the share repurchase programme as a percentage of
paid up capital and free reserves. Firms could also be
categorized into another group based on the announced
motives behind share repurchase announcements. But
in the study sample, almost all the firms announced
`maximizing shareholders value' as the primary motive
behind their repurchase announcements. Hence, such
categorization was not followed for this study.
EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Abnormal Returns around the
Announcement Date
This section presents the analysis of how stock returns
are influenced by repurchase announcements in three
time periods--during repurchase announcement
date, prior to the announcement date, and post
announcement date.
Tables 2 and 3 present the results of the market model.
The daily AARs for all repurchase announcements are
computed over ­28 and +28 periods relative to the event
day 0. In Table 2, only the AARs for the ­10 days and
+10 days are reported. The results reflect that the AARs
in the pre-announcement period (10 days prior to the
announcement date) remain predominantly positive, of
which it is found to be statistically significant on day 7
at 5 per cent level and on days 5 and 3 at 10 per cent
level. The AARs on day 0 (i.e., announcement day) is
also positive and is statistically significant at 5 per cent
level. However, during the post-announcement period,
the AARs are found to be negative in most of the days.
For example, AARs are negative on days 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and
10 of which, it is statistically significant at 5 per cent level
only on day 4. These results do not spell out the existence
of significant abnormal stock returns around repurchase
announcements in the BSE. This finding is contrary to
the findings of Liao et al. (2005), Comment and Jarrell
(1991), Ikenberry et al. (1995, 2000), and Balachandran
and Troiano (2000), etc., who observed positive abnormal
stock return around repurchase announcements.

Note. This table presents the abnormal returns surrounding the
repurchase announcement day t = 0. The t-statistics test the null
hypothesis that the AARs are equal to zero. * and ** indicate statistical
significance at 10% and 5% levels, respectively.
The cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) for
share repurchase announcements are presented in Table
3. Here the CAARs are presented in three different time
periods--the top part of the Table reports CAARs around
the repurchase announcement day, the middle part of
the Table reports CAARs prior to the announcement
day, and finally, the bottom part of the Table shows
CAARs on and after the announcement day. The results
indicate that firms experience positive CAARs around
the repurchase announcement day. For event windows
(­1, +1), (­2, +2), (­3, +3), (­4, +4), (­5, +5), (­10, +10),
(­20, +20), and (­28, +28), the CAARs are positive and
440 ANOMALOUS PRICE BEHAVIOUR AROUND OPEN MARKET STOCK REPURCHASE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN INDIA
all are statistically significant at 5 per cent level, except
the (­20, +20) window which is significant at 1 per cent
level. These results do not necessarily signify positive
impact of share repurchase announcements on stock
returns, as the CAARs in the pre-announcement periods
are also positive. To illustrate, during the (­5, ­1), (­10,
­1), and (­20, ­1) periods, the CAARs are positive and
all are statistically significant. Table 3 also shows that the
CAARs in the post-announcement period are positive for
all the event windows, of which the CAARs pertaining
to (0, +14), (0, +20), and (0, +28) periods are statistically
significant. The CAAR during the period (0, +14) is
significant at 5 per cent level while the CAARs during
(0, +20) and (0, +28) periods are statistically significant at
1 per cent level. Considering all the three time periods--
pre-announcement,aroundannouncementday,andpost-
announcement--it cannot be argued that the CAARs
have increased significantly in the post-announcement
period. The CAARs are predominantly positive in all the
three time periods and there is no significant difference
in the values of CAARs (%) in the post-announcement
period compared to the pre-announcement period.

As reflected in the prior empirical studies, a share
repurchase announcement is often described as a
mechanism to signal the equity undervaluation. If
corporate managers believe that the firm's share price is
being undervalued by the market, they use repurchase
announcementtodisclosethispotentiallyvalue-increasing
information. Findings in the US market experience poor
pre-announcement performance and, subsequently,
outperformance after the repurchase announcements,
thereby supporting the undervaluation hypothesis.
Our finding is contrary to that. This simply signifies
that share repurchase announcements in the BSE do not
necessarily support the `undervaluation hypothesis' and
it is also quite surprising that the objective of `maximizing
shareholders' wealth' is not achieved through share
repurchase announcements by Indian firms.
Difference Analysis
The results above have shown that share repurchase
announcements do not necessarily generate abnormal
stock returns in the Indian equity market. To test the
effects of firm size and the size of repurchase, this study
categorized the entire sample into various subsamples.
The findings are presented in the following.
Firm Size and Price Response
Vermaelen (1981), Ho and Michaely (1988), and Ratner,
Szewczyk, and Tsetsekos (1996) document that the stock
price reaction of large firms is less positive than that of
small firms around share repurchase announcements.
On the other side, Barry and Brown (1984) observe that
the mass media tend to provide less news coverage of
small firms than large ones, which ultimately leads the
large firms' prices to be more information-efficient. Here,
samplefirmswerecategorizedonthebasisoftheirmarket
capitalization, defined as the firm's share price in the
market multiplied by the number of shares outstanding
at the time of share repurchase announcement. As per
the size of market capitalization described earlier, there
were 75 firms under the small-cap category and 14
firms under the mid-cap category. Only six firms were
classified as large-cap; hence, they were ignored.
Panel I of Table 4 shows that the CAARs of the mid-cap
group are negative but statistically insignificant during
the (­20, ­1) window, while the small-cap group
registers statistically significant (at 1 per cent level)
positive CAARs during the same window. The means
test shows a statistically significant mean difference at
10 per cent level. So, in the pre-announcement period,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 4 · OCTOBER-DECEMBER 2015 441
the small-cap group has registered higher CAARs
compared to the mid-cap group. However, during
the (0, +20) period, the mid-cap group experiences
higher CAARs (0.071 %) compared to the small-cap
group (0.024 %) and both are significant at 10 per cent
level, but the difference in the CAARs is statistically
insignificant (t = 1.336). During the (­28, +28) window,
the difference in the CAARs between the two groups are
not statistically significant. During this event window,
both the mid-cap group as well as the small-cap group
experience positive CAARs, of which the CAARs of the
small-cap group (0.087 %) are statistically significant at
5 per cent level. Therefore, the means tests reveal that
the difference in the CAARs between the small-cap and
the mid-cap group is statistically significant only in the
pre-announcement period (­20, ­1) but not in the post-
announcement period (0, +20) and the entire period
(­28, +28). Thus, the empirical findings report a mixed
result with regard to the stock returns and firm size. The
views of Vermaelen (1981), Ratner et al. (1996), and Liao
et al. (2005) that larger firms experience less positive
stock return to share repurchase announcements
compared to small firms is not necessarily applicable in
the Indian equity market.

Size of Repurchase and Stock Price Response
The size of repurchase is often used as a proxy for
information, in which large repurchasing conveys more
information regarding the cash flow position of the
firm (Liao et al., 2005). Davidson and Garrison (1989)
and Ratner et al. (1996) observe a positive association
between abnormal stock return and size of repurchase.
In this subsample analysis, firms are partitioned by
the size of repurchase. As noted earlier, in India, the
maximum permissible size of repurchase is 25 per cent.
Firms are ranked from the largest to the smallest on
the basis of the size of repurchase. Then the sample is
partitioned into the following two groups: the top and
the bottom 25 percentile and the top and the bottom
50 percentile of the size of repurchase. The statistical
significance and magnitude of the stock returns for the
top groups are compared with the bottom groups. The
subsample tests by repurchase size measure the impact
of repurchase size on abnormal stock returns. Panel II
of Table 4 presents the empirical results.
The results show an insignificant difference in the
means between the top and bottom 25 percentiles (t
= ­0.544) during the (­20, ­1) window. The top and
the bottom 50 percentile comparison also reports
insignificant difference in the means between the large
and the small repurchasing firms (in terms of size of
repurchase) during the same event window. In the
pre-announcement period (­20, ­1), the bottom 25 and
the bottom 50 percentile firms have experienced larger
CAARs compared to their top 25 and top 50 percentile
groups, respectively, of which only CAARs of the
bottom 50 percentile group is statistically significant
at 10 per cent level. The results in the window (0, +20)
demonstrate that a larger size repurchase tends to have
higher abnormal returns. To illustrate, the CAARs in
the top 25 percentile (0.058 %) group is significantly
442 ANOMALOUS PRICE BEHAVIOUR AROUND OPEN MARKET STOCK REPURCHASE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN INDIA
larger than that in the bottom 25 percentile group
which reports negative CAARs of ­0.007 per cent,
but is statistically insignificant. Here the means test
shows statistically significant mean difference at 5
per cent level. For the window (0, +20), the outcome
is almost identical in the case of top 50 and bottom 50
percentile analyses but the difference in the means test
does not appear to be significant. The findings in the
(­28, +28) window also show that a larger repurchase
tends to yield higher abnormal returns. However, in
this window, the CAARs are statistically insignificant
for top 25 and bottom 25 percentile comparisons, while
these are significant at 1 per cent level for the top 50
and bottom 50 percentile analyses. In both the cases,
the differences in the means test are not statistically
significant. Overall, the evidence weakly supports
the view that larger repurchase size generates greater
abnormal returns than the smaller ones, which is partly
consistent with the findings of Davidson and Garrison
(1989) and Ratner et al. (1996).
CONCLUSION
The present study uses event methodology to
empirically examine the impact of open market
share repurchases on stock returns in the BSE. The
findings of the study indicate that share repurchase
announcements do not necessarily generate abnormal
stock returns for the repurchasing firms in the Indian
equity market unlike the developed economies like the
US. The results derived from the analyses of AARs and
CAARs show that the undervaluation hypothesis does
not hold good in the Indian equity market implying
that through share repurchases Indian firms are not
able to enhance their share prices in the market. While
analysing whether stock return following repurchase
announcements varies across firm size, a mixed result
is evident. The difference in the CAARs between the
small-cap and mid-cap group is statistically significant
only in the pre-announcement period (­20, ­1) and
not afterwards. The results do not necessarily support
the view that the stock price reaction to repurchase
announcements of the larger firms is less positive
than that of the smaller firms and, finally, the findings
weakly support the view that larger repurchase size
generates greater abnormal returns than smaller firms.
The holistic result indicates that share repurchase
announcements in India do not carry much
information to the investors, and Indian firms are
not able to `maximize shareholders' wealth' through
this corporate activity. The possible reason behind
this could be the nature of the ownership structure
of the Indian firms, which is distinctively different
from those in the US. Indian firms are mostly owned
or otherwise controlled by the founding members
(termed as promoters) unlike the widespread equity
ownership model in the US. Indian firms may go
for share repurchase announcements to counter the
takeover threats or to enhance promoters' stake in the
business. The regulatory norms surrounding share
repurchase have also material impact on this corporate
practice and vary across nations. These areas need to
be investigated further for better understanding of this
corporate activity.
