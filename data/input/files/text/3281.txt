Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the relationship between ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and
other parameters derived from ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, including dipping
status, in patients with grade 1/grade 2 hypertension.
Methods: This retrospective analysis included baseline data from Chinese outpatients enrolled
into a previous study, who had clinic diastolic BP of 90­109 mmHg and systolic BP <180 mmHg,
had undergone 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring and routine blood chemistry investigations, and
had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data.
Results: Out of 120 patients screened, 87 were included. No significant difference in 24-h AASI
was found between dippers and nondippers. The 24-h AASI significantly correlated with age,
systolic BP and pulse pressure, and inversely correlated with 24-h diastolic BP variation and eGFR.
In dippers and nondippers, AASI correlated with daytime pulse pressure, daytime diastolic BP
variation and eGFR; in nondippers, AASI also correlated with 24-h systolic BP and 24-h pulse
pressure. The 24-h AASI was significantly associated with 24-h pulse pressure and daytime pulse
pressure.
Conclusion: In patients with grade 1/grade 2 essential hypertension, AASI shows a significant
correlation with ambulatory pulse pressure.

Introduction
Vascular stiffness is known to be a predictor
of adverse cardiovascular outcomes,1,2
therefore its measurement may be useful in
a clinical setting. The `gold standard' meas-
urement of arterial stiffness, pulse wave
velocity,3 is not commonly used, however,
due to the complexity of the equipment
required. Thus, there has been substantial
research into the development of simpler
measures of vascular resistance for more
widespread clinical use.
Ambulatory arterial stiffness index
(AASI) is a relatively novel estimate of
arterial stiffness that is derived from ambu-
latory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, and
is calculated as one minus the regression
slope of diastolic BP over systolic BP.4,5
There is substantial evidence that AASI
independently predicts cardiovascular mor-
tality, even in normotensive subjects. For
example, AASI has been shown to correlate
with target organ damage and glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) in patients with essen-
tial hypertension,4,6­9 and with cardiovascu-
lar events and mortality,10,11 including
stroke-related mortality.12 In addition,
measurements of AASI have reasonably
good reproducibility and repeatability.13­16
The biological mechanisms that underlie
AASI as a parameter of arterial stiffness,
however, remain unclear. From a mathem-
atical standpoint, the possibility exists that
assessment of AASI may be confounded by
other parameters derived from ambulatory
BP monitoring, including BP variation,
pulse pressure, nocturnal dipping, and the
morning BP surge.17,18 These measures of
variability in BP have been documented by
some reports to be prognostic markers of
target-organ damage and cardiovascular
disease.19­24
In addition to AASI, several other factors
have been reported to correlate with stiffer
vessels in patients with hypertension, includ-
ing a nondipper pattern, and other markers
such as pulse pressure.25,26 The relationship
between these markers and AASI has yet to
be clearly defined in patients with essential
hypertension. The present authors hypothe-
sized that indicators of arterial stiffness
derived from ambulatory BP monitoring
might be correlated with each other. The
purpose of the present study, therefore, was
to evaluate the relationship between meas-
urements of arterial stiffness using AASI,
daytime AASI and night-time AASI with
other markers of vessel stiffness derived
from 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring,
including BP variation, pulse pressure, noc-
turnal dipping, and the morning BP surge, in
patients with grade 1/grade 2 essential
hypertension.27
Patients and methods
Study design and population
The present retrospective study included
baseline data obtained from a proportion
of the population included in a previously
published multicentre, open-label, single-
arm, prospective phase IV clinical trial.28
The original study was conducted between
June 2008 and April 2010 in the outpatient
clinics of 16 tertiary hospitals in China.28
Patients from five of these hospitals: China-
Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing; Peking
University People's Hospital, Beijing; Ruijin
Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University
School of Medicine, Shanghai; Zhongshan
Hospital of Fudan University School of
1324 Journal of International Medical Research 42(6)
Medicine, Shanghai; and Guangdong
General Hospital, Guangzhou, underwent
ambulatory BP monitoring, and were
included in the present analyses. The study
was approved by the local ethics committees
of all five participating hospitals, and writ-
ten informed consent was provided by all
patients. The study followed the Helsinki
Declaration and Good Clinical Practice by
State Food and Drug Administration.
Inclusion criteria comprised: Chinese
outpatients; aged 18­75 years; grade
1/grade 2 essential hypertension with a
clinic diastolic BP of 90­109 mmHg and a
systolic BP <180 mmHg; no antihyperten-
sive medication taken for at least 1 week
prior to the start of the trial. Exclusion
criteria included: secondary hypertension;
isolated systolic hypertension (systolic BP
!140 mmHg and diastolic BP <90 mmHg);
obesity (body mass index [BMI] !30 kg/m2
or body weight !100 kg); use of agents that
might influence BP; pregnancy or childbear-
ing potential; impairment of liver function
(serum alanine transaminase two times the
upper limit of normal); impairment of renal
function (serum creatinine !1.5 times the
upper limit of normal, proteinuria !2þ on a
dip-stick test); indications for the use of
other drugs that may affect BP; hypersensi-
tivity to the study drug;28 any other
conditions that, in the opinion of the inves-
tigators, would make enrolment
inappropriate.
Eligible patients were consecutively
recruited at baseline, at which time all
office measurements, routine haemato-
logical examinations, routine urinalysis,
electrocardiography, and hepatic and renal
function tests were performed. Patients who
met the exclusion criteria were excluded
from the present investigation. Patients
then underwent a 2-week placebo run-in
period, during which they received placebo
medication (Daiichi-Sankyo, Shanghai,
China) and no other antihypertensive
drugs, to clear the system of any prior
medication that may have influenced the
results of the original trial.28
BP measurements
Heart rate was determined at the baseline
visit. Office BP was measured from the right
arm, by trained investigators, using a stand-
ard mercury sphygmomanometer following
European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/
European society of Cardiology (ESC) gui-
dlines.27 Patients were allowed to sit quietly
for !10 min prior to assessment of BP; three
consecutive measurements were made
!2 min apart, and BP was determined as
the mean of the three readings. 24-h ambu-
latory BP monitoring was performed using a
BP monitor (model 90207 and 90217;
Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA,
USA) at the end of the 2-week placebo
run-in period. The ambulatory BP monitors
were set to measure BP every 15 min
between 06.01 h and 22.00 h (daytime;
patients got up at 06.00 h), and every
30 min between 22.01 h and 06.00 h (night-
time; patients went to bed at 22.00 h) using
manufacturer-provided software according
to ESH/ESC guidelines.27 Acceptable 24-h
ambulatory BP monitoring was defined as
continual data collection without interrup-
tion, over a monitoring time of !22 h, with
legible data accounting for !80% of the
total recordings. Ambulatory BP measure-
ments were used to calculate 24-h AASI,
daytime AASI and night-time AASI,
defined as one minus the regression slope
of diastolic BP over systolic BP.
In addition, patients were divided into
two groups for the purpose of analysis
according to their dipper profile, as defined
by the American Heart Association and
following ESH/ESC guidelines:27 dippers
(patients whose nocturnal decrease in sys-
tolic BP/diastolic BP was !10% of daytime
BP) and nondippers (patients whose noctur-
nal decrease in systolic BP/diastolic BP was
<10% of daytime BP).

Laboratory investigations
Venous blood samples (5 ml) were drawn
following a !8 h fast, for routine blood
chemistry investigations: plasma Naþ and
Kþ concentrations, fasting blood glucose,
serum creatinine, haemoglobin, and blood
urea nitrogen. For plasma samples, blood
was collected into vacuum tubes containing
1.5­2.5 mg/ml dipotassium ethylenediami-
netetra-acetic acid (2 ml EDTA-K2
tubes).
Samples were then centrifuged at 1 280 g for
10 min at 4C and the plasma was collected.
For serum samples, blood was allowed to
stand for 30 min at room temperature to
allow clotting. Samples were then centri-
fuged at 1 280 g for 10 min at 4C, and the
serum collected. Serum and plasma samples
were analysed using a regularly calibrated
COBAS Mira Plus chemistry analyser
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Estimated
GFR (eGFR) was calculated using the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
formula:29

Statistical analyses
Data were analysed using SPSSÕ, version
16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Continuous variables were presented as
mean Æ SD, and qualitative variables as
frequency distributions. Categorical vari-
ables were analysed using 2-test.
Differences in continuous variables (such
as AASI, age, BMI, systolic BP/diastolic BP,
BP variation and blood parameters between
dippers and nondippers) were analysed by
independent samples t-test. Pearson's cor-
relation coefficient was used to estimate the
relationship between quantitative variables
obtained from ambulatory BP monitoring
recordings in all participants. In the dipper
and nondipper groups, Partial correlation
coefficient was used to estimate the relation-
ship between quantitative variables obtained
from ambulatory BP monitoring, including
the adjustment variables patient age and
BMI. Multiple linear regression analysis was
performed using 24-h AASI, daytime AASI
and night-time AASI as dependent vari-
ables. The enter method was used in a first
step to adjust for patient age and BMI, the
independent variables (eGFR, office meas-
urements, ambulatory BP, pulse pressure,
morning BP surge, variations of 24 h, day-
time, and night-time BP) were then included
one by one, to avoid colinearity. A
P value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. The statistical power, when a
was set at 0.05, to identify a significant
difference between the dipper and nondipper
groups was 0.90 (two-sided), based on the
final number of patients included for
analyses.
Results
A total of 120 patients, aged 18­75 years,
were screened and provided baseline meas-
urements. Of these patients, 24 were with-
drawn from the study on the basis of
predetermined exclusion criteria, therefore
96 were entered into the 2-week placebo run-
in period. A further nine patients were lost
due to withdrawal from the study. A total of
87 patients (52 male, 35 female; mean age
51 Æ 8 years) completed the study, providing
ambulatory BP monitoring readings that
were deemed of acceptable quality for ana-
lyses (Table 1).
The dipper group comprised 40 patients
(46%) and the nondipper group comprised
47 patients (54%) of whom 13 (27.7%) were
classed as reverse dippers. There were no
significant differences between dipper and
nondipper groups in terms of age, sex or
BMI. The two groups had similar propor-
tions of grade 1 and grade 2 hypertensive

patients: the dipper group comprised 32 with
grade 1 and 8 with grade 2 hypertension; the
nondipper group comprised 39 with grade 1
and 8 with grade 2 hypertension. The dipper
group had significantly higher values for 24-
h systolic BP (P ¼ 0.001), 24-h diastolic BP
(P < 0.001), daytime systolic BP (P ¼ 0.013),
daytime diastolic BP (P ¼ 0.011), night-time

In addition, significant negative correlations
were found between eGFR and 24-h AASI,

Further correlation analyses were under-
taken to establish associations between 24-h

dipper and nondipper groups, 24-h AASI
was significantly positively correlated with
daytime pulse pressure and daytime diastolic

associated with eGFR (P < 0.05). In add-
ition, there were significant (but relatively
weak) positive associations between 24-h
AASI with 24-h systolic BP and 24-h pulse
pressure in the nondipper group (P < 0.05),
but not in the dipper group.
Stepwise linear regression analysis was
performed, including AASI as the independ-
ent variable, and 24-h pulse pressure, day-
time pulse pressure and night-time pulse

24-h AASI was found to significantly cor-
relate with daytime pulse pressure in both

The daytime AASI was found to signifi-
cantly correlate with daytime pulse pressure
in the dipper group, and with night-time
pulse pressure in nondipper group. The
night-time AASI was found to significantly
correlate with daytime pulse pressure in the
dipper group, and with night-time pulse
pressure in both the dipper and nondipper
groups (Table 4).
Discussion
The main findings of the present study were
that AASI did not differ between patients in
the dipper and nondipper groups, and that
pulse pressure showed a clear association
with AASI.
Despite substantial evidence that AASI
may be a useful indicator of arterial stiff-
ness,30 its use as an independent measure of
vascular stiffness, and the extent to which it
is influenced by other parameters not dir-
ectly related to arterial compliance, remain
under debate. The basis of AASI is that an
increase in systolic BP in a stiff artery will be
accompanied by a smaller increase (or
even decrease) in diastolic BP.15
Mathematical considerations indicate, how-
ever, that AASI may be influenced by other
factors, including variations in 24-h diastolic
BP. The present study revealed that AASI
was associated with several parameters
derived from ambulatory BP monitoring,
including 24-h, daytime and night-time sys-
tolic BP, and 24-h, daytime and night-time
pulse pressure. In agreement with the pre-
sent data, AASI has previously been
observed to positively correlate with 24-h
systolic BP, daytime systolic BP, night-time
systolic BP, 24-h pulse pressure, daytime
pulse pressure and night-time pulse pres-
sure,31 while a meta-analysis of cross-sec-
tional and longitudinal studies found that
AASI was independently associated with
systolic BP and 24-h pulse pressure.15
Other studies have reported associations
between AASI and pulse pressure.5,17,32
Additional data supporting AASI as a reli-
able assessment of vascular stiffness include
the findings of its association with other
measures of vascular compliance, such as
carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave
velocity and augmentation index.5,13,15,32­34

cardiovascular and stroke mortality over
and beyond pulse pressure,12 and that
renal disease increases AASI (but not pulse
pressure) in patients with hypertension,35
indicate that AASI is not merely reflecting
alterations in pulse pressure.
Some authors have argued, however, that
AASI is dependent on the degree of noctur-
nal BP fall, and is only weakly associated
with pulse wave velocity.18,36 In untreated
patients with hypertension, one study found
that AASI was higher in dippers (0.44 Æ
0.20) than in nondippers (0.29 Æ 0.15), and
was inversely correlated with nocturnal falls
in systolic BP and diastolic BP; in contrast,
there was no association between pulse wave
velocity and nocturnal BP fall.18 Various
other studies have identified inverse associ-
ations between AASI and nocturnal decline
in BP.17,31 Additional correlations have been
found between AASI and indices of BP
variability. For example, in one study, pulse
pressure variability, systolic BP variability,
diastolic BP variability and nondipper status
were determined to be independent pre-
dictors of AASI, suggesting that AASI is a
parameter that reflects BP variability as well
as arterial stiffness.17 Furthermore, systolic
BP variation and diastolic BP variation have
been shown to correlate with intima-media
thickness, pulse wave velocity and AASI,
with 24-h diastolic BP variation having a
significant association with AASI in a mul-
tiple regression analysis.37 Similarly, AASI
has been found to negatively correlate with
the morning surge in diastolic BP, daytime
diastolic BP, 24-h mean arterial pressure
variability, and nocturnal dips in systolic
BP, diastolic BP and mean arterial pres-
sure.31 These data are broadly consistent
with the observations in the present study.
Interestingly, however, the values of AASI
measured in the present study were not
significantly different between the dipper
and nondipper groups, perhaps suggesting
that although BP variability is related to
AASI, dipping status is not a major
determinant in patients with grade 1/grade
2 hypertension.
The present study found that despite
having similar grades of hypertension,
patients in the dipper group had significantly
higher values for 24-h, daytime and night-
time systolic BP, and 24-h, daytime and
night-time diastolic BP, than those in the
nondipper group. In addition to positive and
negative associations with age and eGFR,
respectively, 24-h AASI showed positive
correlations with 24-h and daytime systolic
BP, and 24-h, daytime and night-time pulse
pressure. No significant associations were
evident between 24-h AASI and measures of
BP variation, except for a weak inverse
correlation with daytime diastolic BP vari-
ation. In subgroup analysis, 24-h AASI was
correlated with eGFR, daytime pulse pres-
sure and daytime diastolic BP variation in
both dipper and nondipper groups, while
additional associations with 24-h systolic BP
and 24-h pulse pressure were observed for
the nondipper group. Overall, AASI was
most strongly correlated with measures of
pulse pressure, and was not associated with
most measures of BP variation, except for
daytime diastolic BP variation. These data
shed further light on the associations
between AASI and other parameters derived
from ambulatory BP monitoring, in patients
with grade 1/grade 2 hypertension.
In the present study, the mean value of
AASI was 0.42 Æ 0.23. AASI has been
reported to be higher in patients with hyper-
tension (0.49 Æ 0.17) than in normotensive
patients (0.36 Æ 0.14).38 In addition, AASI
appears be higher in patients with hyperten-
sion and chronic renal disease than in those
without renal chronic disease,35 and is also
increased in patients with diabetes,32 acro-
megaly38 and high haemoglobin levels.39
The finding in the present study that AASI
correlated with age was in keeping with
numerous investigations that observed the
same phenomenon in patients with
hypertension.5,15,17,18,32­35
Qin et al. 1331
The association between a higher AASI
and impaired renal function, determined by
eGFR, was an additional relevant finding of
the present study. There is some disagree-
ment in the literature concerning the correl-
ation between AASI and eGFR. For
example, some investigators have observed
no correlation between these parameters,13,35
some a weak correlation,40 and others a clear
negative association.6,11 It is perhaps of inter-
est to note that nondipping status and 24-h
systolic BP variation have also been reported
to correlate with lower eGFR.41,42 In patients
with hypertension, age was an independent
predictor of low eGFR.42
The present results are limited by the fact
that this was a retrospective analysis of a
subset of patients taken from a different
study, in which patients with isolated sys-
tolic hypertension (systolic BP !140 mmHg
and diastolic BP <90 mmHg) were required
to be excluded.28 Isolated systolic hyperten-
sion may be indicative of arterial stiffness,
and in elderly patients, arterial stiffness has
been directly implicated in isolated systolic
hypertension, therefore, the exclusion of
such patients may have biased the results.
In conclusion, the present study found
that in a cohort of patients with grade 1/
grade 2 essential hypertension, AASI did not
differ significantly between patients with a
dipper and nondipper status. Significant
correlations were observed, however,
between AASI and certain parameters
reflecting pulse pressure, systolic BP, and
variability in diastolic BP. The clear positive
correlation between AASI and ambulatory
pulse pressure indicates a clinical potential
for AASI as an index of arterial stiffness in
the monitoring the adverse cardiovascular
outcomes, in patients with grade 1/grade 2
essential hypertension.
