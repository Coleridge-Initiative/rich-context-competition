Abstract
Background: The Body Mass Index (BMI) based on self-reported height and weight ("self-
reported BMI") in epidemiologic studies is subject to measurement error. However, because of the
ease and efficiency in gathering height and weight information through interviews, it remains
important to assess the extent of error present in self-reported BMI measures and to explore
possible adjustment factors as well as valid uses of such self-reported measures.
Methods: Using the combined 2001-2006 data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, discrepancies between BMI measures based on self-reported and physical
height and weight measures are estimated and socio-demographic predictors of such discrepancies
are identified. Employing adjustments derived from the socio-demographic predictors, the self-
reported measures of height and weight in the 2001-2006 National Health Interview Survey are
used for population estimates of overweight & obesity as well as the prediction of health risks
associated with large BMI values. The analysis relies on two-way frequency tables as well as linear
and logistic regression models. All point and variance estimates take into account the complex
survey design of the studies involved.
Results: Self-reported BMI values tend to overestimate measured BMI values at the low end of the
BMI scale (< 22) and underestimate BMI values at the high end, particularly at values > 28. The
discrepancies also vary systematically with age (younger and older respondents underestimate their
BMI more than respondents aged 42-55), gender and the ethnic/racial background of the
respondents. BMI scores, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, tend
to narrow, but do not eliminate misclassification of obese people as merely overweight, but health
risk estimates associated with variations in BMI values are virtually the same, whether based on self-
report or measured BMI values.
Conclusion: BMI values based on self-reported height and weight, if corrected for biases
associated with socio-demographic characteristics of the survey respondents, can be used to
estimate health risks associated with variations in BMI, particularly when using parametric
prediction models.

Background
The use of the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on self-
reported height and weight in epidemiologic studies
remains controversial, both because it is an imperfect
measure of a person's percentage of body fat [1] and
because self-reported height and weight are subject to sub-
stantial measurement error [2]. However, BMI measures
calculated from data obtained through interviews con-
tinue to be used as a common tool because of the relative
ease and efficiency in gathering such information. Thus, it
remains important to assess the extent of error present in
BMI measures that are based on self-reported height and
weight (self-reported BMI) compared with BMI measures
based on physical measurement of height and weight
(measured BMI) and to understand the limitations of
using the self-reported measures.
A review of the literature reveals both random and system-
atic errors ("bias") in the use of self-reported measures,
but there remains some controversy over the magnitude
of such errors. In particular, researchers have shown that
over-reporting of height is more common among older
survey respondents [3,4]. In addition, it has often been
reported that men are more likely than women to overes-
timate their height, while women, particularly young
women, are more likely to underestimate their weight
[3,5]. Some researchers have also found systematic varia-
tions in the BMI based on the racial or ethnic background
of interview respondents. For instance, Mexican Ameri-
cans and, in particular, Mexican American women tend to
underestimate their weight, resulting in underestimates of
the prevalence of obesity in this group [6]. In a study of
Mexican citizens, others also found that BMI values calcu-
lated from self-reported height and weight underestimated
BMI values based on measured height and weight --- a ten-
dency that increased with age [7]. However in one study
[8], it was reported that Mexican American adults tend to
underestimate their weight less than non-Hispanic white
adults. A similar pattern also seems to hold for non-His-
panic African American adults, for whom BMI values
computed from self-reported height and weight seem to
produce smaller underestimates of their measured BMIs
than among non-Hispanic whites [6,8]. Conversely, com-
pared to non-Hispanic African American and Hispanic
women, non-Hispanic white women are more prone to
underestimate their weight [4], which may reflect differ-
ent sensitivities about being overweight [9]. Marital status
and income also appear to influence a survey participants'
responses to height and weight questions, with single/
never married as well as divorced persons more likely to
underreport weight, and high income respondents report-
ing their weight and height more accurately [8,10].
Finally, there is strong evidence that the actual BMI itself
is a predictor of the error in BMI measures based on self-
reported height and weight, with underestimates of BMI
becoming larger for respondents with higher-end weight
and BMI values [11-13].
While developing correction factors that could be applied
to self-reported data to eliminate, or at least lessen, the
biases in BMIs associated with self-reported height and
weight is an attractive idea [14], the few attempts that
have been made [15,16] are discouraging. Use of addi-
tional variables beyond self-reported height and weight
provides only small improvements in the prediction of
measured BMI scores and does not appear to eliminate
biases associated with the size of the measured BMI [16].
Beyond the question of possible errors and biases in BMI
measures based on self-reported height and weight, there
is also the question of the purpose for which self-reported
BMI measures are employed. For instance, biases in self-
report may have a great impact on our ability to classify
people as "overweight" or "obese", but may have a smaller
impact on the use of a continuous BMI measure to esti-
mate risks associated with body mass. In much of the lit-
erature, researchers employ the BMI categories based on
the 1998 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) Guidelines, which use the following groupings:
BMI < 18.5 ("underweight"), 18.5 < 25 ("normal
weight"), 25 < 30 ("overweight"), 30 < 35 ("low obesity"),
35 < 40 ("medium obesity"), and  40 ("extreme obes-
ity"). Even though a comparison of BMI categories based
on measured and self-reported height and weight may
reveal substantial misclassifications, it is unclear whether
such misclassification is based on small or large devia-
tions between self-reported and measured BMI values. If
the errors tend to be small, the use of continuous BMI
measures based on self-reported height and weight may
result in fairly accurate estimates of the morbidity and
mortality risks associated with the BMI, even though rela-
tively large misclassifications occur at the margins with
the use of broadly defined BMI categories. This study is
designed to provide estimates of the extent to which sur-
vey respondents are misclassified with respect to their
body mass categories if BMI estimates computed from
self-reported weight and height are used. We will also pro-
vide estimates of the overall measurement errors involved
in using self-report measures and examine the predictors
reviewed, while adding an indicator for current preg-
nancy, on the assumption that temporary weight gain
may lead to under-reporting of weight. Since it has been
well established that the risk of diabetes rises with higher
BMI values [17-19], we will analyze to what extent the
association between the BMI and the risk of diabetes dif-
fers, depending on whether we use physical measures to
calculate BMI or BMI values computed from self-reported
height and weight. Finally, an attempt is made to adjust
BMI values based on self-reported height and weight to
improve their accuracy in classifying respondents as
"overweight" or "obese."

Methods
The following analysis is based on the combined 2001-
2006 data from the continuous National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The
NHANES surveys are multi-stage probability samples of
the non-institutionalized U.S. civilian population. Both
physical measurement and self-reported height and
weight information are collected in the NHANES for the
same individuals, with the questionnaire preceding the
physical examinations. Physical examinations take place
in mobile examination centers and body measurements
are based on standard protocols [20]. The overall
unweighted NHANES response rates for the interview
samples of the three continuous two-year surveys were
84% (2001-2002), 79% (2003-2004), and 80.5% (2005-
2006) [21].
The combined 2001-2006 NHANES sample includes
17,176 adults. Of these, 15,662 (91.2%) had BMI values
based on physical measures of height and weight, and
16,579 (96.5%) had BMI values based on self-reported
height and weight. For 15,161 (88.3%) adult NHANES
participants, both self-reported and measured BMI indica-
tors were available for analysis. Among these, 15,155
adults also provided responses to the question: "Have you
EVER been told by a doctor or health professional that
you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" Response rates for
the height and weight information were lower among
older respondents (particular those over 70 years of age)
and among Hispanics compared to whites and African
Americans, largely due to lower response rates for the
measured height and weight data. Gender differences
were generally small, with men having slightly better
response rates.
For comparison estimates, self-reported data from the
2001-2006 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
Sample Adult components were also analyzed. The NHIS
is a household, multi-stage probability sample survey
conducted annually by NCHS and fielded by the U.S.
Census Bureau for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics [22].
The sample size for the combined 2001-2006 NHIS Sam-
ple Adult interview was 182,251 adults. Of these, 95.3%
had BMI values based on their self-reported height and
weight. The average annual response rate for the 2001-
2006 NHIS household surveys was 88%; the final
response rate for the Sample Adult component (for which
self-response is required) was 72%.
The weight history section of the NHANES interview con-
tained the following two questions: (1) "How tall are you
without shoes?" This question could be answered by the
respondent in terms of feet and inches or meters and cen-
timeters; and (2) "How much do you weigh without
clothes or shoes?" This question could be answered in
terms of pounds or kilograms. The parallel NHIS ques-
tions were: (1) "How tall are you without shoes?" and (2)
"How much do you weigh without shoes?"
Both the NHANES and NHIS surveys are subject to the
CDC/NCHS Ethics Review Board (ERB) to ensure that
appropriate human subjects protections are provided, in
compliance with 45 CFR part 46. All statistical analyses
were carried out with STATA 10.1 software [23], using the
"svy" command to incorporate information on the appro-
priate weights, primary sampling units and strata for cor-
rect variance estimation. This analysis is limited to the
adult (18 years and over) samples in both surveys. Esti-
mates are age-standardized based on the 2000 U.S. Cen-
sus results, using 10-year age intervals.
Results
The results in Table 1 show a substantial amount of mis-
classification of the BMI based on self-reported height and
weight (self-reported BMI) compared with the BMI based
on measured height and weight (measured BMI). More
than 43% of respondents classified as "underweight" and
16% of respondents classified as "overweight" based on
their measured BMI were classified as "normal weight"
using the self-reported BMI. In addition, 19% of respond-
ents classified as "obese" using measured BMI were mis-
classified as "overweight" using self-reported BMI. The
general trend is for classification errors to be larger in the
extreme (over- or underweight) categories. Sensitivity val-
ues (the proportions of overweight or obese persons
according to physical measurement, who are classified as
overweight or obese according to their self-reported meas-
ures) are 91.4% for overweight or more and 83.3% for the
obesity classification. The corresponding positive predic-
tive values (the proportion of self-reported 'overweight' or
'obese' persons who actually are overweight or obese
based on measured height and weight) are 95.8% and
93.9%, respectively. However, a closer look at the misclas-
sifications reveals that the majority of the misclassified
cases have BMI values within an interval of just one unit
from the category boundary in question. For example,
while 43.5% of adults classified as "underweight" based
on their measured BMI were classified as "normal weight"
based on self report, about three-fourths of these individ-
uals (32.1%) had self-reported BMI values at the lower
end of "normal" category --- with a self-reported BMI
value between 18.5 and 19.5. Similarly, while 16.0% of
overweight adults were misclassified as "normal weight"
using self-reported data, nearly two-thirds of these over-
weight adults (10%) had a self-reported BMI values
between 24 and 25; likewise, 19% of obese persons were
misclassified as "overweight" using self-reported BMI, but
more than half of these adults (10.6%) had a self-reported
BMI value between 29 and 30. Finally, among extremely
obese individuals whose self-reported BMI fell below 40,
BMC Public Health 2009, 9:421 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/9/421

9.7% actually had a self-reported BMI between 39 and 40.
Generally, deviations of BMI values based on self-reported
height and weight from BMI values based on measured
height and weight are moderate: an estimated 56% have
self-reported BMI values within a one-unit interval of their
measured BMI, and 81.5% have self-reported BMI values
within two units of their measured BMI (not shown).
More extreme deviations tend to occur at the very top
(underestimates) and bottom (overestimates) of the BMI
distribution.
Table 2 displays arithmetic means for self-reported (SR)
and measured (M) heights, weights and BMIs, as well as
the discrepancies (DIS) between the self-reported and
measured variables. In addition to information about the
standard errors, standardized effect sizes for the discrep-
ancy scores are added. As the rightmost column shows,
the overall population mean for self-reported heights rep-
resents a modest overestimate of one centimeter, while
self-reported weight represents an underestimate of meas-
ured weight by 3/4 of a kilogram (1.6 pounds). The net
result is that the mean population estimate of the BMI,
based on the self-reported heights and weights, is lower
than the mean estimate of the measured BMI by 0.59
units. The effect sizes of the height and weight discrepan-
cies for the total population suggest that height overesti-
mates contribute more to the total population BMI
discrepancies than weight underestimates. However, the
discrepancies in each BMI class hint at linear trends such
that overestimates of self-reported height become larger
with larger measured BMI categories. The weight discrep-
ancies indicate overestimates of self-reported weight in
lower BMI categories and underestimates of self-reported
weight in the higher BMI categories. The net result is a lin-
ear trend towards declining self-reported BMI values rela-
tive to measured BMI values. A linear regression model
predicting the discrepancy between self-reported and
measured BMI values (BMIDIS
) based on the measured
BMI (BMIM
) values leads to the following estimates:
BMIDIS
= 2.283 - 0.102 BMIM
, with standard errors of
0.134 for the intercept and 0.005 for the regression coeffi-
cients. Using this equation, self-reported BMI values
would be unbiased estimates (i.e., BMIDIS
= 0) of actual
(measured) BMI for persons with a BMI of 22.4 (2.283/
0.102), but would overstate actual BMI at lower BMI val-
ues and understate it at higher BMI values. Furthermore,
the effect sizes for the height and weight discrepancies in
the underweight category suggest that weight overesti-
mates play a large role in the BMI overestimates in this
group. By comparison, the effect sizes among the obese
indicate that both height overestimates and weight under-
estimates contribute in equal measure to BMI underesti-
mates.
Three multivariate linear regressions were conducted to
predict variations in the discrepancy variables, i.e., the
over- or underestimates of height (R2 = 0.061, p 0.001),
weight (R2 = 0.070, p 0.001) and BMI (R2 = 0.045, p 
0.001). All three models included the same set of predic-
tors: gender, age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-Hispanic black,
other), marital status (married, widowed, divorced, sepa-
rated, single/never married, living with a partner), educa-
tion (less than high school, finished high school/GED,
some college or more), pregnancy status and household
income (less than $20,000 vs. $20,000 or more). The first
model showed that overestimation of height was greater
among non-Hispanic blacks (+0.15, p < 0.05) and His-

than among all other racial/ethnic groups. In the second
model, overestimation of self-reported weight occurred
among widowed respondents (+.40, p < 0.02) compared
with married individuals, weight was underestimated
among college educated individuals (-0.51, p < 0.01)
compared with individuals with less than a high school
education, while pregnant women underestimated their
weight, on average, more than 5 kg (-5.43, p < 0.01). The
net effect of race/ethnicity, marital status, education,
household income and pregnancy status on over- or
underestimating the BMI remained small: only college-
educated individuals and pregnant women had self-
reported BMI values that were significant underestimates

measured BMIs.

weight and BMI. Both men and women overstate their
height, particularly at older ages, although the extent of
over-reporting is greater for men than for women, p < 0.01
(Figure 1). Men also tend to overstate their weight,
although by relatively small amounts (on average, less
than 1 kg) (Figure 2). In contrast, women understate their
measured weight with the greatest understatement (on
average, more than 3 kg) found among young women
(Figure 2). The net effect on the BMI of these patterns in
self-reporting of height and weight is depicted in Figure 3.
Although self-reported BMI understates measured BMI for
both men and women across all age groups, the discrep-
ancy is significantly greater (p < 0.001) for women except
at the very oldest ages. For both genders, the most accurate
BMI values based on self-reported height and weight are
obtained between the ages 42 and 55, with larger under-
estimates of measured BMI among the youngest and old-
est individuals.
Given the pattern that self-reported BMI values underesti-
mate "true" BMI values, except at very low levels of BMI,
and given that the discrepancies between self-reported
and measured BMI vary systematically with height,
weight, age, gender, pregnancy status, marital status,
income, and, to a lesser extent, with race and ethnicity, we
used these variables to predict measured BMI scores
(Table 3). The results from this regression model show
that self-reported height and weight, in conjunction with
a few demographic characteristics, account for more than
92% of the variation in measured BMI scores. (Note: We
used a polynomial regression approach for height and
weight and age, eliminating higher power terms, if they
showed no significant effect on the dependent variable
[24].) The predicted BMI scores from this model represent
"adjusted" BMI scores, which take account of all the pre-
dictor variables in the equation. While the mean discrep-
ancy between the adjusted and measured BMI is close to
zero, since it is a residual score, these discrepancies con-
tinue to show a systematic, though smaller, bias in rela-
tion to the measured BMI. The simple linear regression
model using the measured BMI values as predictors of the
adjusted discrepancy scores yields the following results:
BMI-(Adjusted) Discrepancy = 2.204 - 0.078 BMI, with
standard errors of 0.109 for the intercept and 0.004 for the
coefficient. Based on this equation, the actual BMI value
at which the adjusted self-reported BMI scores are unbi-
ased is 28.3 (2.204/0.078). Adjusted self-reported BMI

understated in the range above 28.3. However, the biases
are not large; at an actual BMI of 18.5, the average overes-
timate is 0.78 BMI units, while the average underestimate
at a BMI of 40 is 0.91 units.
Classification of individuals as overweight or obese is
improved by employing the adjusted BMI score, predicted
from the regression model shown in Table 3. The adjusted
BMI score improves the sensitivity of being classified as
overweight or more (BMI 25+) to 94.6% (from 91.4%)
and the sensitivity of being classified as obese (BMI of
30+) to 91.5% (from 83.3%). Population estimates are
also improved, as shown in Table 4. The three NHANES
estimates of the percentages of overweight and obese indi-
viduals in the population show that the adjusted self-
reported measure mirrors the BMI categories based on
measured height and weight more closely than the unad-
justed self-reported measure. The NHIS, which exclusively
relies on interview data, yields a very low estimate of the
percentage of obese U.S. residents, even when compared
to the interview data from the NHANES. However, after
applying the NHANES prediction model to the NHIS to
adjust for systematic biases in self-reporting height and
weight, population estimates of overweight and obesity
among U.S. adults using data from the NHIS more closely
approximate the NHANES (measured) estimates,
although significant differences remain for the obesity cat-
egory.
Table 5 shows selected results from five logistic regression
models (three based on the 2001-2006 NHANES and two
based on the 2001-2006 NHIS) used to predict the odds
of having ever been diagnosed with diabetes, based on the
BMI measures. All five multivariate logistic regression
models include an identical set of covariates: gender, age,
education, race/ethnicity and household income. From
the odds ratios associated with the BMI measures (both in
linear and quadratic form), it is apparent that the adjusted
self-reported measures deliver risk estimates that are close
to those obtained on the basis of the measured BMI
scores. In particular, the estimates obtained from the
adjusted NHIS data are almost identical in size to those
for the BMI scores based on measured height and weight
in the NHANES.
Finally, in order to provide independent evidence of the
applicability of the adjustments of BMI scores based on
self-rated height and weight, we used the regression
weights from Table 3 and created an adjusted BMI score
using the 1999-2000 NHANES sample of adult respond-
ents (N = 5448). As with the 2001-2006 NHANES data,
the adjusted BMI score from the prediction model
improves the sensitivity of being classified as overweight
or more (BMI 25+) to 94.2% (from 91.2%) and the sensi-
tivity of being classified as obese (BMI of 30+) to 90.9%
(from 83.9%).
Discussion
Our comparison of BMI values based on self-reports and
physical measurements confirms several of the basic find-
ings in the literature: While self-report and measured
height and weight tend to be highly correlated, there
remain deviations of the self-reported BMI values from
measured BMI values, particularly at the high and low

ends of the BMI scale, which are large enough to result in
substantial misclassifications of either underweight or
obese people (see Table 1). This is not surprising, given
the social sensitivity generally associated with body
images [10,11,14]. However, the consensus in the litera-
ture -- that the use of self-reported BMI measures leads to
substantial underestimates of the population proportion
who are overweight and obese -- needs some refinement.
For instance, as we have shown, underestimates of the
actual BMI based on self-reported height and weight are
generally less severe among adults in the age range of 35
to 55, and the bias towards greater underreporting among
women than men tends to disappear with older age. More
importantly, it is possible to adjust self-reported BMI
scores, based on a few, easily gathered demographic char-
acteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital and preg-
nancy status, and household income), and thus to obtain
a closer approximation to the measured BMI. Of these, age
and gender as well as pregnancy status appear to contrib-
ute most towards adjusting BMI scores. This is not surpris-
ing, as older persons tend to over-report height, probably
because they recall their taller selves of yesterday [3], and
younger women in particular tend to under-report weight,
probably due to a social desirability response [4]. That
pregnant women under-report their weight, but not their
height, should also not be surprising. While the remain-
ing systematic biases are consistent with those reported in
the literature [15,16], overall estimates of the population
prevalence of overweight and obesity are nonetheless
improved substantially by using the adjusted measures.
What is more, it appears that the estimates of health risks
associated with the adjusted self-reported scores of the
BMI are very similar to the risk estimates based on the

measured BMI, if parametric predictors are used. This
should not be surprising, given that more than 80% of the
deviations of self-reported BMI from measured BMI do
not exceed values within Â± 2 BMI units.
While differences in the population estimates of the per-
centages of overweight U.S. residents are within the mar-
gins of sampling errors, the adjusted estimate of the
percentage of obese U.S. residents from the NHIS remains
about 3 percentage points below the estimate from the
NHANES based on measured height and weight. This fail-
ure to completely adjust for these differences may well be
due to a major limitation in the self-reported measures of
the NHANES: respondents knew when they answered
these questions that they would undergo a physical exam-
ination and might have anticipated that they would be
weighed and their height be measured. This may be one
reason why the NHIS estimate of obese adults, using the
unadjusted BMI based on self-reported height and weight,
is more than four percentage points lower than the paral-
lel NHANES estimate and more than six percentage points
below the NHANES estimate based on measured height
and weight. In short, the lack of anticipation of an actual
measurement may have led to a less "realistic" self-report-
ing in the NHIS. Clearly, what is needed for even better
BMI adjustments are comparisons of self-reported and
measured height and weight from population-based sur-
veys, in which respondents would not anticipate being
measured, when asked to report on their height and
weight.
Beyond the question of accuracy in measurement, the use
of the BMI as predictor of various health risks also
depends on the health risks at issue. For instance, some
researchers [25] have shown that the BMI is just as good a
predictor of the incidence of diabetes as a waist-hip ratio
or waist circumference. By contrast, others [26] reported
that the BMI performed somewhat less well than waist cir-
cumference as a measure of risk for cardiovascular dis-
eases. Still, given the costs of data collection and the
ability to reduce, even though not eliminate, systematic
biases through adjustments using a few demographic var-
iables, BMI values based on self-reported height and
weight remain an important tool for population-based
estimates of the health risks involved in obesity.
BMI values based on self-reported height and weight, if
corrected for biases associated with socio-demographic
characteristics of the survey respondents, can be used to
provide accurate estimates of the proportion of over-
weight members of the population, but they still underes-
timate the proportion of obese population members. On
the other hand, adjusted self-report measures do provide
accurate estimates of health risks associated with varia-
tions in BMI, particularly when using parametric predic-
tion models. Still, given the costs of data collection and
the ability to reduce, even though not eliminate, system-
atic biases through adjustments using a few demographic
variables, BMI values based on self-reported height and
weight remain an important tool for population-based
estimates of the health risks involved in obesity.
Conclusion
BMI values based on self-reported height and weight, if
corrected for biases associated with socio-demographic
characteristics of the survey respondents, can be used to
provide accurate estimates of the proportion of over-
weight members of the population, but they still underes-
timate the proportion of obese population members. On
the other hand, adjusted self-report measures do provide
