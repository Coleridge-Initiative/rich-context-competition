Introduction: Patient education is a critical component of the patient-centered medical home and is a
powerful and effective tool in chronic disease management. However, little is known about the effect of
practice payment on rates of patient education during office encounters.
Methods: For this study we took data from the 2009 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. This
was a cross-sectional analysis of patient visits to primary care providers to determine whether practice
payment in the form of capitated payments is associated within patient education being included more
frequently during office visits compared with other payment methods.
Results: In a sample size of 9863 visits in which capitation status was available and the provider was
the patient's primary care provider, the weighted percentages of visits including patient education were
measured as a percentages of education (95% confidence intervals): <25% capitation, 42.7% (38.3­
47.3); 26% to 50% capitation, 37.6% (23.5­54.2); 51% to 75% capitation, 38.4% (28.1­49.8); >75%
capitation, 74.0% (52.2­88.1). In an adjusted logistic model controlling for new patients (yes/no),
number of chronic conditions, number of medications managed, number of previous visits within the
year, and age and sex of the patients, the odds of receiving education were reported as odds ratios
(95% confidence intervals): <25% capitation, 1.00 (1.00­1.00); 26% to 50% capitation, 0.77 (0.38­
1.58); 51% to 75% capitation, 0.81 (0.53­1.25); and >75% capitation, 3.38 (1.23­9.30).
Conclusions: Patients are more likely to receive education if their primary care providers receive
primarily capitated payment. This association is generally important for health policymakers construct-
ing payment strategies for patient populations who would most benefit from interventions that incorpo-
rate or depend on patient education, such as populations requiring management of chronic diseases.

Patient education is an important tool for physicians in
preventing the deterioration of health due to illness and
for promoting healthy lifestyle choices.1 Multiple studies
have examined interventions involving patient educa-
tion, including several emphasizing shared decision
making.2 Benefits of greater patient education include
improved use of value-based choices, improved patient-
practitioner communication, increased involvement of
the patient in decision making, and improved knowl-
edge and realistic perception of outcomes.3 For example,
a nurse-led intervention to educate patients regarding
nonpharmacologic strategies to reduce gastroesophageal
reflux demonstrated reduced patient symptoms4; simi-
larly, a patient education program to promote exercise
resulted in greater exercise tolerance and fewer costs for
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.5
Numerous payment structures, including tradi-
tional fee for service, risk-adjusted pay for perfor-
mance, capitation, and bundled payments, have

been discussed by health services researchers with
regard to their impact on the quality of care deliv-
ered to patients.6,7 Recent calls for increased qual-
ity of care and reduced cost of care at a population
level have focused on the redesign of primary
care.8 Because of the accelerating interest in pay-
ment reform and accountable care organizations,
there has been renewed interest in the effect of
population-based capitated payment on quality
of care.9
Previous work has shown that there are differ-
ences in quality of primary care when comparing
traditional fee-for-service payment arrangements
to capitated payment systems.10 It is understood
that capitated payment systems have significant ef-
fects on how physicians deliver care11 and how
patients trust their physicians.12 However, the ef-
fect of capitated payment structures on the provi-
sion of patient education in particular has not been
fully elucidated in the literature.
Therefore, we examined the association between
the proportion of revenue received through capita-
tion within a given practice and the proportion of
patient visits indicating patient education was pro-
vided during the visit. We hypothesized that prac-
tices with higher levels of capitated payments
would more often include patient education as part
of a primary care outpatient visit.
Methods
We took the data for this study from the 2009
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a na-
tionally representative survey of office visits made
to non-federally employed physicians in private of-
fices and community health centers throughout the
United States. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's National Center for Health Care Statistics
conducts this survey annually, and it is exempt from
approval by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention's institutional review board.
The survey employs a multistage probability de-
sign that accounts for 3 stages of probability sam-
pling--geographic primary sampling units, physi-
cian practices within the primary sampling units,
and patient visits within the physician practices--to
produce weighted national estimates of office visits.
Office personnel use collection forms provided by
the survey to obtain information about the visits,
including patient demographics, medical condi-
tions, treatments and medications ordered or pro-
vided at the time of the visit, as well as other
office-related information, during a 1-week sam-
pling period.13
This study entailed a cross-sectional analysis
of data collected from visits where the provider
identified themselves as the patient's primary
care provider. Among these visits, levels of cap-
itation for the practice were collected via a vari-
able within the dataset that featured 4 levels of
capitation: 25%, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%,
and 75%. These levels of capitation were prede-
termined in the survey and a continuous measure of
capitation was not available. Patient education was
determined through a yes/no response to a question
asking whether patient education was either provided
or ordered at the time of the visit. Further informa-
tion about the visit that was collected included
the patient's age and sex, whether the patient had
been seen before by the practice, the number of
visits made by the patient to the practice within
the past 12 months, the number of chronic con-
ditions mentioned during the visit, the number of
medications managed during the visit, and the
expected source of payment for the visit. Own-
ership of the practice was a variable available
within the dataset and included health mainte-
nance organization (HMO) as an option. How-
ever, analysis of this variable found that 2% of
the total number of sampled visits met this def-
inition. More than 75% of all sampled visits were
made to a practice that was owned by a physician
or physician group. Therefore, it was not possi-
ble to stratify ownership type by levels of revenue
capitation because of the small sample size.
The total sample size used for analyses was 9863
patient visits. Initially, we used univariate descrip-
tive analyses to demonstrate a general characteriza-
tion of the sample. We then conducted bivariate
analyses using 2 tests to determine significant dif-
ferences in patient education across the different
levels of practice capitation. Finally, we used a
logistic regression model to test differences among
the different levels of practice capitation while tak-
ing into account other characteristics of the visits
(mentioned earlier). All analyses were conducted
using SUDAAN software (RTI International, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC; available at http://
www.rti.org/sudaan/) to account for the complex
sampling design of the survey and to produce na-
tional estimates.

Results
The sample used in these analyses represented an
estimated total of nearly 390 million patient visits.
The vast majority (347.1 million) were visits to
practices that had a rate of capitated payment
25%, representing approximately 89% of the to-
tal sample. Visits to practices with capitation rates
of 25% to 50% represented nearly 4% of the sam-
ple, visits to practices with capitation rates of 51%­
75% represented nearly 5% of the sample, and
visits to practices with capitation rates of 75%
represented nearly 2% of the sample. Across the
different levels of capitation there were no signifi-
cant differences in the average age of patients seen,
the percentage of female patients seen, the average
number of chronic illnesses being managed, the
average number of medications being managed, the
percentage of visits by established patients, the av-
erage number of visits by the patients within the
past 12 months, or the percentage of visits where
the expected primary source of payment was either
Medicare or private insurance (Table 1).
When we examined the percentage of visits
where patient education was either ordered or de-
livered at the time of the visit, again, we found no
significant differences across the different levels of
capitation. We found that among visits to practices
that received 75% of their revenue from capita-
tion, a larger proportion of visits had patient edu-
cation involved compared with the proportion of
visits to practices with lower levels of capitation.
However, this proportion was not significantly
higher (Table 2).
The relationship between patient education and
levels of practice capitation was more fully eluci-
dated using logistic regression models. In an unad-
justed model where practices receiving less than
25% of their revenue from capitation was set as the
reference, visits to practices with 75% capitation
were nearly 4 times as likely to have patient edu-
cation associated with the visit (odds ratio, 3.81;
95% confidence interval, 1.44­10.09). This effect
was somewhat attenuated in a fully adjusted model
controlling for patient age and sex, whether the
patient was established in the practice, the number
of visits made to the practice within the past 12
months by the patient, the number of chronic ill-
nesses being managed, the number of medications
being managed, and expected payment source for
the visit. Even so, these visits were more than 3
times as likely (odds ratio 3.38; 95% confidence
interval, 1.23­9.30) to involve patient education
(Table 3).

Discussion
Our analyses suggest that capitated payments are
associated with increased delivery of health educa-
tion to patients in a primary care setting. There are
a couple of possible explanations for this finding,
the first being the focus on prevention as a cost
reduction strategy in a managed care environment.
It is possible that patient education is provided as a
means of giving the patient more information on
how to manage chronic conditions before they be-
come acute and require more costly emergency
care. Another possible explanation of this finding
may be that there is a reduced focus on patient
volume in a capitated environment compared with
a fee-for-service environment. However, it is not
possible to determine the plausibility of either of
these explanations because of the lack of more de-
tailed data on practice characteristics such as own-
ership of the practice. However, our data does
provide a preliminary snapshot of national differ-
ences in the provision of patient education, which is
a proven tool in the management of chronic health
conditions, by levels of revenue received through
capitation within a practice.
As health care reform unfolds and discussions on
compensation strategies evolve, one method of re-
imbursement that is beginning to gain greater trac-
tion is capitated payments. Researchers have hy-
pothesized that these capitated payments not only
will reduce overall treatment costs in the long run,
but that they are an incentive to provide care that
will help reduce many unnecessary treatments in
the short term and replace these treatments with
more long-term solutions to good health, such as
education about living a healthy lifestyle and self-
management of chronic disease.
Previous work has examined the effects of capi-
tated payments on the delivery of services in a
primary care setting. One such study examined the
relationship between the level of managed care
penetration within a practice and treatment behav-
ior by physicians across patients.14 Those authors
found that in practices where there are varied pay-
ment sources, duration of the visit across patients,
all with varied payment sources, remains constant
as managed care penetration increases within the
practice. However, in these same practices, among
patients who fall under a capitated payment system,
the number of medications prescribed during the
visit drops. The authors concluded that changes in
payment methods can change physician behaviors
and that physicians adopt a treatment style that
delivers similar treatment intensity to all patients
regardless of payment source.
Another similar study by Landon and col-
leagues15 found that physicians who were in a
highly capitated environment had lower total costs
for patients covered under capitation and the in-
tensity of care for these patients also was lower.
These authors suggest that capitation is a strong
incentive against providing additional services.
However, there was no mention of the provision of
health education, which could be a factor in con-
trolling costly chronic conditions.
Recent work has examined multiple variations in
primary care reimbursement, including full capita-
tion as well as pay-for-performance models. How-
ever, critics of these models have pointed out that
many of the proposed payment mechanisms fall
short of fairly compensating primary care physi-
cians for the complex management of multiple
chronic diseases. Bereneson and Rich16 noted that
as the public health care system begins to rely more
heavily on primary care, extensive changes to the
way primary care physicians are reimbursed for
their work are necessary. Berenson and Rich17 go
on to propose numerous payment plans combining
traditional fee-for-service reimbursement with per-
patient, per-month capitation payments that sup-

port the patient centered medical home concept,
which is argued to be the lynchpin for a reformed
health care system.
Gorrol and colleagues18 have proposed a pay-
ment system that goes beyond a basic bundled
payment method and extends reimbursement in a
risk-adjusted manner to better compensate primary
care physicians who take care of patients with mul-
tiple chronic conditions requiring complex care.
More recently, Ash and Ellis19 used large claims
databases to propose a payment model called the
"primary care activity level model," which is a fur-
ther extension of a risk-adjusted capitated payment
and takes into account patients' socioeconomic sta-
tus to predict outcomes. In this model, primary
care physicians were reimbursed more accurately
for the care that they provided by taking into ac-
count a better picture of the whole patient and the
desired outcomes for each patient, rather than sim-
ply adjusting patient pools for risk.
Limitations
The findings of this study need to be consid-
ered in light of a number of limitations. First,
this is a cross-sectional study; therefore, we could
establish only a limited temporal relationship be-
tween capitation and the provision of health ed-
ucation. A stronger relationship between the two
variables could be established through a longitu-
dinal design examining capitated payments and
delivery of health education over time. These
data demonstrate a statistical association at only
one point in time.
Second, we could not determine from these data
whether each discrete visit was specifically reimbursed
through a capitated payment. We could determine only
the percentage of all payments received in the form of
capitation for the entire office. Furthermore, many visits
are reimbursed by multiple payers at different propor-
tions of payment. A more granular data source that
shows not only the expected payment source for a visit
but also whether the visits were reimbursed from a
larger capitation scheme would allow for a better under-
standing.
Third, it was not possible to determine the exact
structure of the practice in terms of its ownership
and governance. An ownership variable was avail-
able in the dataset that defined ownership as being
privately owned or being owned by an HMO, a
community health center, an academic medical
center, or a hospital or other health care organiza-
tion. During analyses, however, it was determined
that 2% of all practices in the available data were
owned by an HMO. Therefore, it was not possible
to stratify these practices by levels of capitated
revenue because of small sample sizes. Since a small
number of practices were owned by an HMO, it is
believed that this would not have had a significant
effect on the adjusted regression outcomes. Fur-
thermore, practice ownership was highly correlated
with the percentage of revenue that was received
through capitation, which would have resulted in
confounding.
Fourth, the number of medications being man-
aged and the number of chronic medical conditions
for each patient are crude measurements of visit
acuity. It is possible that patients with lower num-
bers of medications and different types of chronic
conditions may require a higher level of care that
was not assessed in this data.
Fifth, the definition of levels of capitated reve-
nue in the dataset did not allow for a threshold
effect to be tested. The levels were set at 25%,
25% to 50%, 51% to 75%, and 75%. Future data
collection could ask for a more granular estimate
for revenue received through capitation, which
would allow for better explanation of changes in
practice behavior.
Finally, the sample size for visits to practices
with higher levels of capitated payments was rel-
atively small compared with the number of visits
to practices with lower levels of capitated pay-
ments. This situation is suspect for the nonsig-
nificant findings in the bivariate analyses. Among
visits to practices with higher levels of capitated
payments, the percentage of patients receiving
health education was considerably higher. How-
ever, those results were not significantly different
compared with the other levels of capitated pay-
ments because the smaller numbers of visits pro-
duced larger confidence intervals for the percent-
age estimates. We suspect that a larger sample
size would have produced significant outcomes in
the bivariate analyses. Even so, multivariate anal-
yses demonstrated the significant relationship
between increased capitation and the delivery of
health education.
Conclusions
Despite these limitations, this study has provided a
preliminary picture of capitation and the delivery of

health education in a primary care setting using
recent nationally representative data. These find-
ings speak to the current national discussion of how
best to reduce rising health care costs while at the
same time retaining or even increasing the quality
of care that is delivered.
New systems of health care delivery that focus
on population health are now developing, and pri-
mary care physicians along with patient-centered
medical homes are at the root of such systems.20
One of the foundations of the new model of care is
the accountable care organization, which relies on
primary care practitioners to decrease health care
costs within a population, while at the same time
increasing the overall health of that population.
However, debates over the most efficient reim-
bursement methods for this type of system seem to
center on pay-for-performance measures that tar-
get defined patient populations rather than com-
munities at large.21 This model may work well with
specific populations, but it may not benefit patients
outside of the target diagnoses. Therefore, discus-
sions of new health care reimbursement models
could consider patient education an important fac-
tor in promoting population health. Finding inno-
vative reimbursement methods that reduce cost and
increase quality for all patients is necessary to achieving
a better performing US health care system.
