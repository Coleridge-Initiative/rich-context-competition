Previous research has shown that traumatic life events are
associated with a diagnosis of psychosis. Rather than focus
on particular events, this study aimed to estimate the effect
of cumulative traumatic experiences on psychosis. The
study was based on 2 large community samples (The Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey [NCS], The British Psychiatric
Morbidity Survey [BPMS]). All analyses were conducted
using hierarchical binary logistic regression, with psychosis
diagnosis as the dependent variable. Background demo-
graphic variables were included in the first block, in addi-
tion to alcohol/drug dependence and depression. A variable
indicating the number of traumas experienced was entered
in the second block. Experiencing 2 or more trauma types
significantly predicted psychosis, and there appeared to be
a dose-response type relationship. Particular traumatic
experiences have been implicated in the etiology of psycho-
sis. Consistent with previous research, molestation and
physical abuse were significant predictors of psychosis us-
ing the NCS, whereas for the BPMS, serious injury or as-
sault and violence in the home were statistically significant.
This study indicated the added risk of multiple traumatic
experiences.
Key words: psychosis/trauma/community samples
Introduction
Epidemiological surveys from the United States of Amer-
ica and Europe have consistently reported high rates of
exposure to traumatic events and indeed the occurrence
of multiple traumatic events for individuals.1­5 Such ev-
idence indicates that multiple traumatic experiences are
not uncommon, and research suggests that such cumula-
tive trauma has a particularly detrimental impact on an
individual's physical and mental health. Based on a large
community sample in Finland, research suggested that
experiencing 3 or more traumatic events significantly in-
creased the likelihood of persistent depression compared
with those who did not experience any traumatic events.
The odds ratios (ORs) indicated a 6-fold increase in risk.5
Additional research found a dose-response relationship
between number of reported abuse types and poorer men-
tal health in a study involving 8667 health maintenance
organization members.6
With reference to psychotic illnesses, there is a high
rate of multiple trauma experiences in people with severe
mental illness, particularly with regard to interpersonal
violence.7 Yet, little work has sought to empirically inves-
tigate the link between cumulative trauma and psychosis,
despite strong evidence for the relationship between trau-
matic experiences and psychosis.8,9 Some pertinent re-
search has however investigated this relationship. For
instance, a dose-response type relationship between
childhood abuse and psychotic symptoms in adulthood
has been reported,10 in addition to a graded relationship
between childhood trauma and hallucinations.11 Also,
the degree of impairment in schizophrenia spectrum dis-
orders was found to be positively associated with the
number of types of maltreatment being experienced.12
In contrast, however, 1 prospective study found no sup-
port for an association between childhood sexual abuse
and schizophrenic disorders in adulthood. However, the
authors noted a number of methodological limitations
that may have decreased the probability of finding an as-
sociation between childhood sexual abuse and mental
disorders.13 The case for a trauma-psychosis link is how-
ever consistently supported by research that reports
high rates of sexual abuse in childhood, in addition to
other traumatic experiences, within psychotic popula-
tions.7,14,15 Indeed, in 1 study, over half of patients ad-
mitted as a result of first-episode psychosis reported
incidents of childhood sexual abuse.16 Furthermore, in
a review of the case notes of 200 community patients,
there was a significantly higher probability of having 2
or more Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth Edition,17 symptoms of schizophrenia

if childhood or adult sexual abuse was experienced.18
Moreover, recent research reported significantly more
childhood trauma (including interpersonal assaults) in
a psychosis sample (n = 40) versus a nonpsychosis, psy-
chiatric comparison group (n = 30). This difference was
not present for adult traumatic experiences.19 In a recent
analysis of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS),
a large representative general population sample in the
United States of America,20 multiple traumatic experien-
ces were found to be associated with visual, auditory, and
tactile hallucinations, and a dose-response relationship
was reported.21
Following on from these empirical findings, the pur-
pose of this research is to establish if a graded, or
dose-response, relationship exists between the cumulative
number of traumas experienced and the likelihood of
a diagnosis of psychosis. The analyses are based on large
nationally representative samples from the United States
of America (NCS) and the United Kingdom (British
Psychiatric Morbidity Survey [BPMS]) and focus primar-
ily on interpersonal traumas.20,22 It was predicted that
a dose-response association would exist between trauma
and psychosis, with greater trauma increasing the likeli-
hood of psychotic symptoms.
Method
Samples
Two large-scale, nationally representative surveys, one
from the United States of America, the other from the
United Kingdom, were utilized.
The National Comorbidity Survey. The NCS was a -
collaborative epidemiologic investigation (1990­1992)
based on a stratified, multi-stage, area probability sample
of noninstitutionalized persons aged between 15 and
54 years in the 48 coterminous states of the United States
of America designed to study the prevalence and corre-
lates of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Revised Third Edition, disorders.23 The initial
survey employed a household sample of over 8000 re-
spondents, and a subsample of the original respondents
completed the additional NCS, Part II, that contained
a further detailed risk factor battery and additional diag-
noses. A full description of the NCS is available.20 Full
data were available for 5782 participants (48% male).
BritishPsychiatricMorbiditySurvey. The second BPMS
in Great Britain was a 2-phase assessment of mental dis-
orders conducted in 2000. After first-phase interviews,
a sample of people was then selected for a second phase
consisting of clinical interviews. The survey focused on
adults aged 16­74 years who were recruited using a strat-
ified multistage random probability sampling strategy.
Interviews were successfully conducted with 8580 adults
(45% male). Details of the survey methods are available.22
Instruments and diagnoses
The National Comorbidity Survey. A modified version
of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview
(CIDI)24 was used to assess the lifetime prevalence of
nonaffective psychosis (a summary category made up
of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaf-
fective disorder, delusional disorder, and atypical
psychosis) and depression. The NCS also elicited infor-
mation on the occurrences of traumatic events (these
were presented to the respondent on a list and referenced
only by number). We selected 5 questions that repre-
sented childhood victimization, threats to physical integ-
rity, and threats to sexual integrity. Specifically, a "yes" or
"no" response was required to the following questions:
1. You were seriously neglected as a child
2. You were physically abused as a child
3. You were seriously physically attacked or assaulted
4. You were raped (someone had sexual intercourse with
you when you did not want to by threatening you or
using some degree of force)
5. You were sexually molested (someone touched or felt
your genitals when you did not want them to)
No explicit age limit was stated for "childhood" events.
A summed variable was created to represent the total
number of traumas experienced (ranging from 0 to 5).
British Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. A 2-phase ap-
proach was used to assess the presence of a psychotic dis-
order. Initially, The Psychosis Screening Questionnaire
was used at the first interview and followed by adminis-
tration of the Schedule for Assessment in Neuropsychi-
atry for those who met screening criteria.25,26 Responses
from 5 questions from the List of Threatening Experien-
ces27 were used to represent victimization, threats to
physical integrity, and threats to sexual integrity (these
were presented to the respondent on a list and referenced
only by number). Specifically, a "yes" or "no" response
was required to the following statements:
1. Serious illness, injury or assault to yourself
2. Bullying
3. Violence at work
4. Violence in the home
5. Sexual abuse
Background variables
The background variables presented in Table 1 were used
in the analyses. For the NCS, diagnoses of depression
and alcohol and drug dependence were all CIDI based.
For the BPMS, the diagnosis of an alcohol problem
was based on a score greater than 8 on the Alcohol
Use Disorders Identification Test.28,29 The Clinical Inter-
view Schedule Revised was used to produce specific

International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
diagnoses of neurosis.30 The diagnosis of a depressive ep-
isode was included as a covariate. A description of the
algorithms used is available.22 Five questions relating
to drug dependence were asked, and a positive response
to any one indicated some level of drug dependence.
Analysis
Two analyses were conducted; one based on the NCS and
the other based on the BPMS. All analyses were conducted
using hierarchical binary logistic regression in SPSS 11.0.
The dependent variable in each case was the psychosis
diagnosis (0, no psychosis; 1, psychosis). The following
background variables, or covariates, were used in the first
block: sex, age, education, employment status, living ar-
rangements,income,ethnicity,urbanicity,alcoholproblem/
dependence, drug problem/dependence, and depression.
The variable representing the total number of traumas
was entered in the second block. A simple contrast was
usedspecifyingthefirstlevel(notraumas)tobethereference
category. All other categories of the predictor variable
are compared with the reference category. This provides
an estimate of the likelihood of psychosis for each number
of traumas compared with the trauma-free group. All
analyses used the appropriate sampling weight variable.

Cumulative Traumas and Psychosis
of cumulative traumas for both samples are presented in
Table 3. Regarding the experience of different types of
traumatic events, Table 3 shows increased endorsement
for the BPMS sample. This may be due to the more `gen-
eral' nature of the wording of the traumatic experiences in
the BPMS, compared with the more specific wording in
the NCS survey.
Table 3 shows that the majority of both samples did not
experience any traumas and the number of people who
experienced cumulative traumas decreased as the number
of traumas increased. A very small percentage of individ-
uals experienced 4 or more traumas. For the BPMS, the
overall weighted prevalence of psychosis was 0.5%, which
was slightly lower than 0.8% for the NCS.31
The results from the hierarchical binary logistic regres-
sion are presented in Table 4. The addition of the variable
representing traumas made a significant improvement in
the model for both the NCS (block 1: v2 = 68, df = 11,
P < .01; block 2: v2 = 93, df = 16, P < .01; Dv2 = 25,
Ddf = 5, P < .01) and the BPMS (block 1: v2 = 158,
df = 11, P < .01; block 2: v2 = 250, df = 16, P < .01;
Dv2 = 92, Ddf = 5, P < .01) data. The only significant
background variable for the NCS was depression. For
the BPMS, significance tests showed that the diagnosis
of psychosis is related to being male, lower educational
attainment, unemployment, lower income, urban envi-
ronment, and depression. These differences are likely
to be attributable to the minor differences in the study
protocols because the odds ratios indicate the effects
were in the same direction and of similar magnitude.
In order to identify which specific traumas were max-
imally related to psychosis, the analyses were rerun with
the 5 trauma variables being entered in the second block.
A stepwise selection procedure was used to identify the
most important variables. For the NCS, the variables
representing molestation (OR 2.51; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI] 1.17­5.42; P < .01) and childhood physical abuse
(OR 4.20; 95% CI 1.94­9.13; P < .05) were statistically
significant. For the BPMS, the variables representing sex-
ual abuse (OR 5.69; 95% CI 3.22­10.06; P < .01), serious
illness, injury or assault (OR 2.94; 95% CI 1.77­4.89;
P < .01), and violence at home (OR 2.16; 95%
CI 1.21­3.87; P < .05) were statistically significant.
For both the NCS and the BPMS experiencing 1 trauma
was not significantly associated with a diagnosis of

psychosis (see Table 4). However, experiencing more than 1
trauma type was significantly associated with psychosis.
For the NCS, there was an increase in the odds ratios
as the number of traumas increased, although the differ-
ence between the odds ratios for 3 and 4 traumas was
small. For the BPMS, the odds ratio for 3 traumas
was higher than that for 4 traumas. The odds ratio for
5 traumas was the highest in both samples.
Discussion
The current study set out to examine if cumulative trau-
mas were associated with greater acknowledgment of
psychosis symptoms in 2 nationally representative sam-
ples, one from the United States of America and the other
from the United Kingdom. Results clearly demonstrate
that multiple traumatic experiences were associated
with an increased likelihood of psychosis. Although a sin-
gle trauma type did not significantly increase the likeli-
hood of psychosis, experiencing 2 or more types of
trauma significantly increased the likelihood of psycho-
sis, with dramatic increases associated with experiencing
all trauma types. The findings pertinently demonstrate
a dose-response relationship between trauma and psy-
chosis in these nonclinical samples, with increases in psy-
chosis likelihood associated with more trauma exposure.
Prior work in representative general population samples
had supported a link between multiple traumas and psy-
chiatric illnesses, such as depression.5 The present results
confirmed previous findings within the trauma and psy-
chosis literature by using 2 large community samples and
highlightedadose-responseeffectwithreferencetotrauma
and the increased likelihood of psychosis. Of particular
emphasis were interpersonal traumas, and interestingly,
these general population samples indicate that more
than 1 type of interpersonal trauma is required to increase
the likelihood of reporting psychosis symptoms.
Although the dose-response association between the
experience of traumas and psychosis was generally evi-
dent, the increase in the odds ratios was not entirely con-
sistent for the BPMS. Specifically, the experience of
3 traumatic events resulted in a higher probability of psy-
chosis than with 4 traumatic events. Yet, with this finding
aside, the BPMS still showed a clear dose-response effect.
Another interesting aspect of the results was that for both
samples, the odds ratios associated with 5 traumas were
very high relative to those for 4 traumas. For both the
NCS and BPMS, the odds ratios associated with 5 trau-
mas were similar or higher than the upper 95%
confidence interval for 4 traumas. This suggests that al-
though the relationships appear to be generally mono-
tonic, they are not linear due to this large increase in
effect size for 5 traumas.
The current study showed that for the NCS, the trau-
mas most significantly associated to psychosis were mo-
lestation and physical abuse as a child. This is largely
consistent with previous research in the area.32 Based
on the BPMS, sexual abuse was the trauma with the
strongest association with psychosis. Serious illness, in-
jury or assault, and violence in the home were also sta-
tistically significant. Such associations have now been
reported consistently using both clinical and nonclinical
samples.18,19,33­35 The argument for a causal relationship
has been further strengthened by the use of prospective
studies10 or studies that do not rely on retrospective
accounts of traumatic experiences.36 The current findings
indicate the added risk of multiple traumas. A recent text
provides a substantive review of the literature regarding
the link between trauma and psychosis.37
The central challenge for future research is identifying
and understanding the key mechanisms, which link in-
creased trauma with psychosis symptoms. Cognitive
models have identified the importance of misattributions,
misinterpretations, and beliefs about psychosomatosen-
sory experiences in the development and maintenance
of psychosis symptoms, such as hallucinations and delu-
sions.38­40 With a rediscovery of the effects of trauma on
the body and on psychological as well as somatosensory
systems, cumulative interpersonal traumas may heighten
psychosomatosensory activation increasing the likeli-
hood of etiologically significant misattributions, along
with those that have a maintenance effect.41,42 Dissocia-
tion is another psychological variable proposed to link
traumatic experience with especially positive psychotic
symptoms.35,43­46 Hallucinations, for example, may be
the consequence of a failure to integrate percepts with af-
fective and cognitive representations of a traumatic
event.47 More traumas would lead to more dissociation
and therefore greater fragmentary representations of
traumatic events, which may be experienced as hallucina-
tions. These and other explanatory models require empir-
ical assessment.
Alternatively, a Traumagenic Neurodevelopmental
model8 has been proposed that suggests early traumatic
life events can produce physiological changes that con-
tribute to greater vulnerability to psychosis. In particular,
this model proposes that stressful events produce activa-
tion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
which is associated with the release of glucocorticoids,
which can subsequently impair the regulation of the
HPA axis if exposure to traumatic experiences is pro-
longed. Such a process has also been implicated in the
development of posttraumatic stress disorder48
(PTSD). This may account for the high rates of comorbid
PTSD with psychosis,49,50 similarity of psychotic and
PTSD symptoms51 and PTSD as a contributing factor
in interactive models of psychosis.52,53 The limitations
of using general population samples to infer potential
relationships in clinical disorders, such as the psychoses,
has been addressed elsewhere54 as has the type of meth-
odology used here. Additionally, research has addressed
the methodological issues associated with the reliability

by around 50%.59 But a particular limitation of the current
study, in light of the variables examined, is no specific age
limit or age specificity for traumatic events. With no indica-

ferent traumas is comparable.
The current study has demonstrated the relationship
between multiple childhood and interpersonal trauma
types and increased likelihood of experiencing psychosis
symptoms in 2 large, representative, general population
samples. As well as highlighting a dose-response relation-
shipbetweentraumatypesandpsychosis,theseresultsfur-
therhighlighttheneedforathoroughtraumaassessmentin

likelihood that, where appropriate, interventions can be
psychologically formulated and driven. However, there
remainsapressingneedforagreaterempiricalunderstand-
ing of the nature of, and difference between, psychosis
associated with trauma and psychosis unassociated with
trauma. Studies have tended to report trauma associated
with a large number of psychotic individuals, but not all.
Thus, there is no empirical foundation to suggest that
trauma is an etiological risk factor for all psychoses. Con-
sequently, different treatment strategies may be required
for different psychotic presentations and etiological foun-
dations. As this study alludes to, for some individuals,
the impact of multiple childhood interpersonal traumas
may be pertinent to both case formulation and treatment.
