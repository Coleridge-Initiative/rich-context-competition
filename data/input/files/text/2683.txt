Abstract
Background: Whether non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are diseases of poverty or affluence in low-and-middle income
countries has been vigorously debated. Most analyses of NCDs have used self-reported data, which is biased by differential
access to healthcare services between groups of different socioeconomic status (SES). We sought to compare self-reported
diagnoses versus standardised measures of NCD prevalence across SES groups in India.
Methods: We calculated age-adjusted prevalence rates of common NCDs from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult
Health, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. We compared self-reported diagnoses to standardized measures
of disease for five NCDs. We calculated wealth-related and education-related disparities in NCD prevalence by calculating
concentration index (C), which ranges from 21 to +1 (concentration of disease among lower and higher SES groups,
respectively).
Findings: NCD prevalence was higher (range 5.2 to 19.1%) for standardised measures than self-reported diagnoses (range
3.1 to 9.4%). Several NCDs were particularly concentrated among higher SES groups according to self-reported diagnoses
(Csrd
) but were concentrated either among lower SES groups or showed no strong socioeconomic gradient using
standardized measures (Csm
): age-standardised wealth-related C: angina Csrd
0.02 vs. Csm
20.17; asthma and lung diseases
Csrd
20.05 vs. Csm
20.04 (age-standardised education-related Csrd
0.04 vs. Csm
20.05); vision problems Csrd
0.07 vs. Csm
20.05;
depression Csrd
0.07 vs. Csm
20.13. Indicating similar trends of standardized measures detecting more cases among low SES,
concentration of hypertension declined among higher SES (Csrd
0.19 vs. Csm
0.03).
Conclusions: The socio-economic patterning of NCD prevalence differs markedly when assessed by standardized criteria
versus self-reported diagnoses. NCDs in India are not necessarily diseases of affluence but also of poverty, indicating likely
under-diagnosis and under-reporting of diseases among the poor. Standardized measures should be used, wherever
feasible, to estimate the true prevalence of NCDs.

Introduction
Non-communicable disease (NCDs) are increasingly dominating
health care needs in low and middle income countries (LMICs)
with their importance gaining increased policy recognition over
the past decade [1,2,3,4]. NCDs such as heart disease, stroke,
diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases are by far the
leading causes of mortality representing 60% of all deaths globally
- with 80% occurring in LMICs [5,6,7,8].
Among LMICs, India is considered a particularly important
nation to study the emerging burden of NCDs. India is projected
to experience more deaths from NCDs than any other country
over the next decade, due to the size of population and worsening
risk factor profile, associated with recent dramatic economic
growth [9,10,11,12,13,14]. The country has deep and entrenched
social and economic disparities, with affordable healthcare being
beyond the reach of large sections of society [15,16,17]. Further,
India has emerging data sources with which to study NCD risk

factors [18,19] and can serve as a policy leader on NCD control
for other LMICs [20,21].
The epidemiologic transition from a predominance of infectious
diseases to NCDs is thought to arise initially in the better-off
sections of a population due to their more rapid acquisition of life-
styles related to economic development [22]. For example, while
coronary heart disease mortality in England and Wales was
initially concentrated among the wealthy, this pattern apparently
reversed over two to three decades [23], although the veracity of
these data is contested [24].
The epidemiological evidence on the socioeconomic status
(SES) related patterning of NCDs remains limited in LMICs.
Indian data drawn from the National Sample Survey Office
(NSSO) 2004 found that prevalence of NCDs was highest among
higher-income groups when based on self reported statistics [25].
The positive association between income and the prevalence of
disease at the national level was also observed in the self-reported
diabetes from the National Family Health Survey-3 [26].
Conversely, evidence from a study in Chennai, which used
biochemical measures for diagnosis, revealed the prevalence of
diabetes and cardio-metabolic risk factors rapidly increased in low
income groups over a ten year period, such that they `caught up'
to those of middle income groups [27]. Furthermore, a recent
study using more objective indicators confirmed greater preva-
lence of cardiovascular diseases risk factors among the low SES
groups in India [28]. An important question is whether these
contrasting findings are due to artefact, largely arising from
different measurement approaches. And, are reported socioeco-
nomic inequalities in NCDs biased by differential access to
healthcare services between groups of different SES in India?
Epidemiological studies of NCDs using self-reported measures
might underestimate prevalence in low SES groups as wealthier
groups have relatively more access to healthcare in poor countries.
More specifically, detection biases can significantly affect the rate
of diagnosis between SES groups as socially disadvantaged
individuals with less education and living in places with poor
medical and health facilities fail to perceive and report the
presence of illness and thus fail to seek healthcare, in addition to
several organizational and social or cultural and financial barriers
that limit the access to healthcare services [29,30,31,32]. Thus, use
of more standardized measures may better estimate the true
prevalence of NCDs.
Here, we use Indian data from the Study on Global Ageing and
Adult Health to assess socio-economic differences in NCD
prevalence. We developed a standardized measure of NCD
prevalence by utilizing various standardized criteria available
and then compared standardised diagnostic measures (hereafter
termed standardized measures) with self-reported diagnoses to
examine the extent to which socio-economic inequality in NCD
prevalence documented in previous studies may be due to artefact
and differential access to healthcare services between groups of
different SES.
Data and Methods
We used individual level, cross-sectional data (Wave 1: version
1.1.0) from the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health
(SAGE), initiated by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
(hereafter WHO SAGE survey) and conducted in India during
April-August 2007. The survey was designed to generate a
nationally representative sample, thus, the states selected covered
diverse geographic locations and varying levels of development in
India [19,33,34,35] and comprised of Maharashtra (west),
Karnataka (south), West Bengal (east), Assam (north east),
Rajasthan (north) and Uttar Pradesh (central). Sampling methods
were based on the design developed for the World Health Survey,
2002 [33] where a probability sampling strategy was employed
using multi-stage, stratified, random cluster samples. The primary
sampling units were stratified by region and location (urban/rural)
and, within each stratum, enumeration areas were selected. Details
are available on the SAGE website (www.who.int/healthinfo/
systems/sage).
The households selected in a state were distributed among its
rural and urban areas in proportion to their state population. The
WHO SAGE aimed to generate nationally representative samples
of persons aged 50+ years with comparison samples of younger
adults aged 18­49 years. Only one individual aged 18­49 years
was invited to complete the individual interview per household,
whereas all individuals aged 50+ were invited. A total of 10424
households were surveyed with information being collected on
individual health modules from 12198 individual respondents
giving an overall household level response rate of 87% and an
individual level response rate of 65% [35]. Of these, 5048 and
7150 individuals were aged 18­49 years and 50+ years,
respectively. A weighting scheme was devised to construct a
sample with nationally-representative characteristics by including
sample selection and a post-stratification factor [35]. The survey
instrument was conducted using an interviewer-administered
questionnaire in the native language of the respondent using
local, commonly understood terms. A total of five languages with
back translation to English were used in the survey to ensure
accuracy and comparability. Proxy respondents were identified for
selected individuals who were unable to complete the interview.
Ethical clearance was obtained from research review boards
local to each participating SAGE site (several of which are linked
to universities), in addition to the WHO Ethical Review
Committee. Informed consent was obtained from each respondent
prior to interview.
Major NCDs
Five major NCDs (under two broad categories) were identified
using respondent self-reported diagnoses and standardized mea-
sures: i) Cardiovascular diseases: angina, and hypertension, and ii)
Non- cardiovascular- diseases: chronic lung diseases (emphysema,
bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma,
vision problems and depression (mental disorders). The measure of
both self-report of diagnoses and standardized measures of these
NCDs were used.
Table 1 shows the descriptions of the relevant survey questions
for self-reports of diagnosed cases as well as the criteria used for
developing standardized measures for the identification of the
NCDs. For self-reported diagnosed cases, participants were asked
whether they had ever been diagnosed with each condition. This
measure would estimate prevalence of specific NCD among only
those who i) perceived presence of NCDs or their symptoms (either
by people themselves or through family members or other
members of society etc), and ii) reported such cases for diagnoses.
At the same time, this measure excludes those cases that were
undiagnosed irrespective of whether or not people had perceived
the presence of NCDs.
Standardized measures for angina was derived from WHO-
Rose angina questionnaire [36]. The WHO-Rose angina ques-
tionnaire has been widely used in epidemiological studies and
some studies found that using a shortened version of the WHO-
Rose angina questionnaire is adequate [37,38]. The WHO-Rose
angina questionnaire has been validated among south Asian
population [39]. Recently, the full version of questionnaire has
been validated among the Bangladesh population (who have
Inequalities in Non-Communicable Diseases
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68219
similar socioeconomic and cultural characteristics as of Indian
population) by comparing with cardiologists' diagnoses and found
that the WHO-Rose angina questionnaire had 53% sensitivity and
89% specificity [40]. The standardised measure used for
hypertension was blood pressure measurement and then we used
the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure cut-offs per
WHO criteria for hypertension in adults 18 years and older
[41,42]. Results from spirometry (lung function) test was used as
standardised measure for asthma and lung diseases and we
followed the criteria suggested by the Global Initiative for
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) for identifying obstructive
diseases that would include asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis
and emphysema [43]. Prevalence of vision problems were
estimated using the Tumbling E LogMAR chart [44,45]. Finally,
standard criteria of `moderate depression' was derived from the
ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders [46].
Socio-economic and demographic variables used in our analysis
include: age, gender, education, caste/tribe, geographical location
and economic status. Except age, all the other included variables
were defined as categorical (dummy) variables and the classifica-
tion are as follows: Gender as male and female; Education as five
categories: `No formal education', `Less than primary school'
`Primary school completed', `High/secondary school', and `Col-
lege/university education', Caste and tribe as Scheduled caste (SC)/
scheduled tribes (ST), No caste/tribe, and Other caste/tribe;
Location as census defined urban or rural; Economic status as asset
score quintiles: (first (lowest), and fifth (highest) quintile). A
validated asset (wealth) score index, as originally reported in
WHO SAGE data set [34], was derived using WHO standard

NCDs
Self-reported diagnoses
(Survey Questions) Standardized measurement
Angina Have you ever been diagnosed
with angina or angina pectoris
(a heart disease)?
Each of the following 3 conditions was to be met: 1) During the last 12 months, the respondents have had
experienced any pain or discomfort in the chest when walking uphill or hurry and/or ordinary pace on level
ground. 2) The pain or discomfort had been relieved while just simply stopping the walk.3) The pain or
discomfort site is either `sternum' (all level) or `left anterior chest and left arm'. To identify location of pain or
discomfort, respondents were asked to choose from a picture depicting numbered panels of the upper body.
Hypertension Have you ever been diagnosed
with high blood pressure
(hypertension)?
Blood pressure measurement were taken with `Boso Medistar Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor Model S' where the
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate were documented. Blood pressure
measurements were done three times for each respondent and at least 1 minute interval has been given
between each blood pressure reading. Based on the WHO criteria of hypertension for adults 18 years and
older, we defined people with hypertension as those who have reported the systolic blood pressure
$140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure $90 mmHg. S there were three blood pressure readings, we
have taken an average of the three readings, separately for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure
[41,42].
Asthma &
Chronic lung
diseases
Have you ever been diagnosed
with asthma (an allergic respiratory
disease)? Have you ever been
diagnosed with chronic lung
disease (emphysema,
bronchitis, COPD)?
Spirometry was performed after the administration of an adequate dose of short-acting inhaled bronchodilator
in order to minimise variability. The respondents were asked to take a deep breath and then to blow as long
and hard as he/she can into a small tube attached to the spirometry machine and then FEV1 (Forced Expiratory
Volume in One Second) and FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) were documented. Three trails of spirometry test were
performed. The ratio of FEV1
(Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second) to FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) was
calculated. Following the specific spirometry cut-points suggested by GOLD, those with FEV1
/FVC ,70% and
also had an FEV1
, `80% predicted', in all the three trials, were termed as people with moderate and above
forms of (including severe and very severe) obstructive (lung) diseases [43].
Vision problems In the last 5 years, were you
diagnosed with a cataract in one
or both of your eyes (cloudiness
in the lens of the eye)?
Using the four meter distance vision Tumbling E LogMAR chart, vision tests were conducted for distance vision
for both left and right eyes and the recorded the resulting `DECIMAL' value of each eye. If the respondents use
the glasses or contact lenses, the tests were conducted using them. In accordance with WHO criteria [44,45],
we applied the definition of the low vision as an approximate Log MAR equivalent of `0.5 and above' which
corresponded to a `DECIMAL' value of `0.32 and below', thus, in our analysis, those who score `DECIMAL' value
of `0.32 and below' in the distance vision test for at least one eye were categorized as suffering from vision
problems.
Depression Have you ever been diagnosed
with depression?
In order to categorize a person as suffering from `moderate depression', firstly, the following two `General
criteria' (i.e., General criteria 1 and 2) should be met [46]. 1) General criteria 1: At least two of the following
three symptoms (conditions) must be present: i) during the last 12 months, have had a period lasting several
days when felt sad, empty or depressed; ii) during the last 12 months, have had a period lasting several days
when lost interest in most things usually enjoy such as personal relationships, work or hobbies/recreation, iii)
during the last 12 months, have had a period lasting several days when have been feeling energy decreased or
that are tired all the time. 2) General criteria 2: The depressive episode should last for at least 2 weeks.
Secondly, if the above stated conditions are met, then a total of at least six conditions (symptoms) should be
present to term a person as having `moderate depression'. These six conditions can be from the below stated
three conditions from `General criteria 19, and/or, from the following `Seven Sub-conditions' 3) Seven Sub-
conditions: i) During this period, person did feel negative about him/herself or like he/she had lost confidence
and/or did frequently feel hopeless - that there was no way to improve things, ii) During this period, person did
feel anxious and worried most days, iii) During this period, the person did think of death, or wish he/she were
dead, and/or did he/she ever try to end own life, iv) During this period, did he/she have any difficulties
concentrating; for example, listening to others, working, watching TV, listening to the radio, and/or did notice
any slowing down in his/her thinking, v) He/she did notice any slowing down in his/her moving around, and/or
he/she were so restless or jittery nearly every day that he/she paced up and down and couldn't sit still, vi) He/
she did notice any problems falling asleep, and/or, he/she did notice any problems waking up too early, and
vii) During this period, he/she did lose his/her appetite.

household ownership of durable goods, neighbourhood and
dwelling characteristics, and access to water, sanitation, electricity
[47].
Statistical Analysis
Age-adjusted prevalence rates were calculated for self-reported
diagnoses and standardized measures of diseases using an age
weighting. We used the concentration index of inequality to
quantify the magnitude of socio-economic disparities in NCD
prevalence between groups. A variety of methods, ranging from
simplest to sophisticated, are available to measure the socio-
economic inequalities in health, including range, Gini coefficient
(and associated Lorenz curve), Pseudo Gini coefficient (and
associated pseudo Lorenz curve), index of dissimilarity, slope
index of inequality (and the relative index of inequality- a derived
measure from the slope index of inequality), and concentration
index [48,49]. The measure of range, which considers the
differences between the top and bottom socioeconomic groups is
considered as the simplest inequality measure reflecting the socio-
economic dimension to inequalities in health, however, it does not
reflect the population distribution and is not sensitive to changes in
the distribution of the population across socioeconomic groups.
On the other hand, the Gini coefficient, the pseudo-Gini
coefficient and the index of dissimilarity reflect population
distribution and sensitive to changes in the distribution of the of
the population across socioeconomic groups but do not reflect the
socio-economic dimension to inequalities in health [49]. The
concentration index, a generalisation of the Gini coefficient [50],
and the slope index (and relative index) of inequality are likely to
present an accurate picture of economic inequalities in health by
reflecting both the socioeconomic dimension to inequalities in
health and the experiences of the entire population, and also being
sensitive to changes in the distribution of the population across
socioeconomic groups [49,51,52,53]. There is little to choose
between the concentration index and slope index (and relative
index) of inequality because the slope index is equal to the
generalized concentration index divided by the variance of the
relative rank variable (relative rank in the socioeconomic
distribution) and the relative index of inequality is equal to the
concentration index divided by twice the variance of the relative
rank [49]. Recently, the concentration index has been increasingly
used to characterize socio-economic disparities in health in an
objective manner [51,52,53,54,55,56].
Concentration index (C) was computed as twice the (weighted)
covariance of the health variable (`ill-health' in the present study)
and a person's relative rank in terms of economic status, divided
by the variable mean, according to equation below [53,57,58].

hi(1{Ri) ð1Þ
where nis the sample size, hi
is the ill-health of the ith individual, m
is the (weighted) mean of the ill-health, Ri
is the fractional rank of
the ith individual in terms of the index of household economic
status. The value of the concentration index can vary between 21
and +1. However, when the health variable whose inequality is
being investigated is binary, the minimum and maximum possible
values of the concentration index are equal to m21 and 12m,
respectively, where m is the mean of the variable in question [59].
A negative value implies that a variable is concentrated among the
lower SES while the opposite is true (i.e. concentrated among the
better-off) for positive values. When there is no inequality, the
concentration index will be zero [49].
Several measures of SES are available but no measure is
considered as the gold standard. Standard economic measures of
SES use monetary information, such as income or consumption
expenditure. However, the collection of accurate income and
expenditure data is a demanding task and have limitations that
that, in some instances, measuring income can be difficult for the
self or transitory employed (e.g. agricultural work), due to
accounting issues and seasonality, people may have income and
expenditure in kind, and there is possibility of under-reporting of
income due to the fear to potential taxation or exclusion from
social security programs, [60,61,62]. Education also has been used
another measure of SES [48]. Recently, asset based measures that
capture living standards, such as household ownership of durable
assets (e.g. TV, car) and infrastructure and housing characteristics
(e.g. source of water, sanitation facility) are increasingly being used
to measure the SES [63,64]. In the present study, we used wealth
(asset score index) and education as two distinct indicators of SES
[48], and thus estimated wealth-related concentration index and
education-related concentration index in the prevalence of NCDs.
The concentration index was estimated with ADePT software that
was developed by the World Bank [65]. All other statistical
estimations were done with the STATA version 10 (Stata Corp,
College Station, Texas) [66].
Results
Prevalence Rate Differences between Self-reports and
Standardized Measures
We found significantly lower prevalence rates for all NCDs
when a diagnosis was based on self-report of diagnosed cases
rather than standardized measures, except asthma and chronic
lung diseases (Figure 1). The prevalence rate of hypertension was
9.4% according to self-report of diagnosed cases versus 19.1%
using standardized measures. Similarly, the prevalence of angina
was 3.1% versus 6.9%, asthma and chronic lung disease
prevalence was 5.9% versus 5.2%, vision problems prevalence
was 6.1% versus 16.7% and moderate depression prevalence was
3.4% versus 8.5%.
Disparities in NCD Prevalence by Wealth and Education
The age-standardised prevalence rate of the diseases, using both
self-report of diagnosed cases and standardized measures, by
demographic and socio-economic variables are presented in
Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3. Self-reported diagnosed cases of
disease prevalence were significantly higher in the most affluent
quintile compared with the least affluent quintile. Conversely,
disease prevalence measured using standardized measures tended
to show either negative or no strong association with wealth.
Similar trends were observed for educational level too.
Table 3 shows the wealth-related and the education-related
concentration indices (C) of the diseases in terms of i) Unstan-
dardized C, ii) Age-standardised C, and iii) Age and sex
standardized C, separately for self-report of diagnosed cases (Csrd
)
and standardized measures (Csm
).
Several NCDs were concentrated among the lower SES
groups using standardized measures whereas self-reported
diagnosed cases indicated concentration among the higher
SES groups, however, with considerable variation in the
magnitude, beyond chance as reflected by the confidence
intervals (See Table 3). Each of the two cardiovascular diseases
has a higher concentration of disease among higher SES groups
according to self-reported diagnoses. The age-standardised
wealth-related concentration index and education-related con-
centration index for standardised measures of the prevalence of

angina is 20.17 and 20.13, respectively. It means that the
prevalence of angina (identified through standardized measures)
is concentrated among the poor and the less-educated, which
implies that a 17% reduction in the prevalence of angina
among the poor and 13% reduction in the prevalence of angina
among the less-educated would eradicate the observed disparity
in the total prevalence of angina across SES groups. On the
other hands, the self-reported diagnoses of angina was
concentrated among the rich (wealth-related Csrd
0.02) and
the highly-educated (education-related Csrd
0.03). The self-
reported diagnosed cases of hypertension is highly concentrated
among the higher SES and continue to concentrate among
higher SES groups per standardized measures but with
considerable attenuation as standardized measures detect
relatively more cases of hypertension among low SES (wealth-
related Csrd
0.19 vs. Csm
0.03 and education-related Csrd
0.12 vs. Csm
0.01).
The age-standardised concentration index for self-reported
diagnoses of asthma and lung diseases (wealth-related Csrd
20.05 vs. Csm 20.04; education-related Csrd 0.04 vs. Csm
20.05), vision problems (wealth-related Csrd 0.07 vs. Csm 20.05;
education-related Csrd 0.02 vs. Csm 20.06) and depression (wealth-
related Csrd 0.07 vs. Csm 20.13; education-related Csrd 0.06 vs. Csm
20.09) showed positive values of C (i.e. concentration among the
affluent/better educated), whereas negative values of C were
found for standardized measures (i.e. concentration among the
poor/less educated), with exception of asthma and chronic lung
diseases showing negative value for wealth-related Csrd but positive
value for education-related Csrd.
As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the majority of NCDs were
concentrated among higher SES groups using self-reports but were
concentrated among lower SES groups or showing no strong
gradient based on standardized measures, indicating considerable
probable under-diagnosis and under-reporting of diseases among
lower SES groups.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that the prevalence and socioeco-
nomic disparities in several NCDs among the Indian adult

population using nationally representative data depend on
whether self-reported diagnoses or standardized measures of
NCDs are used. We attempted to incorporate more standard-
ised measures of prevalence of NCDs as self-reported diagnosed
cases of NCDs might be poor indicators of the true prevalence
of NCDs across various SES groups where people especially
from the lower SES and remote place might often fail to
perceive and report the illness, and those who were able to
perceive might fail to access healthcare due to several
constraints. We found that wealth-related and education-related
concentration of disease varied with greater concentration
among the affluent/educated when using self-reported diagnoses
and either among lower SES groups or showed no strong SES
gradient when using standardized measures of disease. This may
be consistent with observations that NCDs are typically either
under-reported or under-diagnosed in LMICs, including India
[29,67]. These findings provide salient information for the
ongoing debate about whether NCDs in LMICs are concen-
trated among the affluent or among poorer groups as in high
income countries [68]. Furthermore, our findings suggest that

self-reported NCD prevalence estimates may be highly mislead-
ing if used to determine burden of disease or for targeting
interventions.
Though our analysis found statistically significant values of age-
standardised concentration indices for each of the five NCDs, no
sweeping generalisation about the concentration of NCDs among
the affluent or the poor should be made. First, the patterns vary
depending on the method used to quantify prevalence of NCD.
Second, the patterns vary depending on the disease considered.
Third, the magnitude of concentration indices for both self-
reported diagnoses and standardized measures were not very high.
For instance, the education-related concentration index for the
standardized measures of asthma and lung disease is 20.05, which
means that a mere 5% reduction of the prevalence of asthma and
lung diseases among the less-educated would eradicate the
observed disparity in its total prevalence.
Previous studies in India have demonstrated the increased risk
of cardiovascular disease and cardio-metabolic risk factors in
affluent groups [69,70,71], and have highlighted the higher
levels of tobacco use among poorer groups [9,72], indicating the
likelihood of increased cardiovascular disease and other NCDs
in the future. Comparisons of socio-economic patterning of
NCDs using self-reported diagnoses and standardized measures
within the same nationally representative datasets have not
previously been reported. Our study indicates that the socio-
economic patterning of NCDs found in LMICs may depend on
the diagnostic criteria employed. A recent study conducted in
rural India [73] found lower rates of screening for elevated
blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol in lower SES
groups. This is consistent with our assertion that the lower self-
reported prevalence of NCDs in low SES groups, identified here
and elsewhere, may be due to under-diagnosis and under-
reporting arising from poorer access to high quality health care.
There are several important caveats and limitations to this
study. First, our data do not include younger people (below 18
years). However, this would have limited bearing on findings,
except possibly for asthma and lung diseases, as most of the
conditions studied largely occur in adults. Second, we used
cross-sectional data which prevent us from making causal
inferences on factors contributing to disparities in prevalence
rate. We cannot capture, using such data, the full longitudinal
trends that may differ between socioeconomic groups to
evaluate whether an epidemiological transition is occurring.
Differences in prevalence rates between self-reported diagnoses
and standardized measure may vary in the future, particularly if
proposals for universal health care in India are achieved [74].
Third, though this study incorporated standardized measures to
identify NCDs to the extent possible, more comprehensive and
reliable indicators such as biomarkers of disease and clinical
examination are required to validate these results. Some of the
standardized measures used in the WHO SAGE study to assess
the prevalence of angina and depression, were based on
symptom reports, and the reliability of such measures is also
limited by lack of comprehensiveness and is also subject to
reporting biases. Considerations such as health literacy are
important to account for, and may bias our results toward
underestimating prevalence rates among the poor, who may
have a more difficult time comprehending questions about
disease symptomatology. Finally, our study could not include
the standardized measure for diabetes, one of the major NCDs
that has a prevalence of 3.1% and concentration among the
better-off (wealth-related Csrd
0.24; education-related Csrd
0.25)
per self-reported diagnoses. Furthermore, stroke and arthritis
(with self-reported diagnoses prevalence rate of 1.0% and 9.4%,
respectively) were excluded from our analysis as the prevalence
measures available from the WHO SAGE survey were not
sufficient enough to construct standardised measures of preva-
lence.
Our study has important policy implications. As a part of the
growing attention to the prevention and management of NCDs
in LMICs, early detection of chronic diseases is now part of
Indian national policy (National Program for Prevention and
Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and
Stroke-NPCDCS 2010), and similar efforts are being considered
in other LMICs. Similar to other NCDs, mental health had so
far not been in the policy priorities in India, where scarcity in
mental healthcare infrastructure and social stigma in accessing
mental health are major concerns, and the findings from this

study will inform policy making as the Indian government has
recently been considering a national mental health bill. It is
important that the potential impact of such programmes on
health disparities is assessed during their design, implementation
and evaluation [75]. Our findings suggest that use of self-
reported diagnoses of NCDs may lead to erroneous conclusions
about policy impacts and that more standardized objective
diagnostic criteria for NCDs should be used wherever feasible.
While policy interest in NCD prevention in LMICs is
increasing, many health and development programmes still
neglect NCDs on the grounds that they are diseases of
affluence. Our findings add to growing evidence that this may
no longer be a tenable proposition.
Further research into the mechanisms that may explain
discrepancies between self-reported diagnoses and standardized
or more objective measures of the prevalence of NCDs is
warranted. Moreover, we need further evidence on whether
transitions of diseases from affluent to poor groups occurs in
LMICs, as its occurrence has been questioned in high income
countries [15]. Several theories about the rise in NCDs have
assumed that higher income correlates with the increased intake of
energy-dense and unhealthy foods that are high in fat, sugars and
total calories, as well as increased sedentary lifestyles, which is
believed to relate to obesity and heart disease. This theory does not
adequately explain our findings.
In summary, we found that self-reported diagnoses prevalence
rates of NCDs were concentrated among the affluent while
standardized measures of the same NCDs showed them to be
concentrated among the poor or show no gradient. This
suggests considerable problems of access to healthcare for NCD
diagnosis as well as under-reporting of diseases condition among
the poor. Strategies to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in
NCD prevalence should be further investigated by testing
hypotheses that may further explain disparities in risk,
disparities in diagnosis, and effective intervention among the
highest-prevalence groups. Moreover, disease-wise in-depth
investigation of the socio-economic determinants of each chronic
diseases is required instead of considering all NCDs in one
basket. Health development programmes should consider re-
