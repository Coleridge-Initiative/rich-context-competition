Non-technical summary
Research Question
In empirical discussions of unconventional monetary policy, one controversial issue is the
behavior of the exchange rate with no clear results. Theoretical papers addressing this topic,
cannot be used as guidance either as they are usually lacking the analysis of the exchange rate.
To address this gap in literature, I develop a two-country open economy model which allows me
to not only look at the impact of unconventional measures on the exchange rate but also on the
policy coordination of unconventional measures between central banks.
Contribution
In this paper, I implement an interbank market consisting of two banks (a savings and a lending
bank) as seen in de Walque et al. (2009) into a two-country economy framework similar to Faia
(2005, 2008). Moreover, I model two different unconventional measures which were commonly
used during the crisis: central bank liquidity injections and asset swaps. This model setup allows
for a meaningful analysis of the impact of unconventional measures on the exchange rate by
capturing the transmission of unconventional measures from bank balance sheets to the
economy.
Results
The results show that, different unconventional measures have different implications on the
exchange rate. While liquidity injections appreciate the domestic exchange rate in the short run,
they lead to a mild depreciation in the long run. Asset swaps on the contrary, cause a short run
depreciation but lead to a long run appreciation of the currency. As regards the coordination of
unconventional monetary policy, results show that if central banks do not coordinate liquidity
injections, they lead to higher increases in GDP but also to higher fluctuations in inflation in the
domestic economy, while the other economy will be negatively affected through a decline in
economic growth. In contrary, when central banks coordinate asset swaps, it leads to higher
GDP growth and lower fluctuations in inflation in both countries. The results of this paper
suggest that the impact of unconventional measures on the exchange rate is not uniform and
depends crucially on the choice of instrument. The same is true for policy coordination.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Ein umstrittenes Thema in der empirischen Diskussion der unkonventionellen Geldpolitik ist
das Verhalten des Wechselkurses, mit keinem klaren Ergebnis. Theoretische Arbeiten, die sich
mit diesem Thema befassen, können nicht zu Rate gezogen werden, da die Analyse des
Wechselkurses in diesen Arbeiten meist gänzlich fehlt. Um diese Literaturlücke zu schließen,
entwickle ich ein Zwei-Länder-Modell, das mir nicht nur erlaubt die Auswirkungen der
unkonventionellen Geldpolitik auf den Wechselkurs von einem theoretischen Standpunkt aus zu
betrachten, sondern auch die Koordination der unkonventionellen Geldpolitik zwischen
Zentralbanken.
Beitrag
In diesem Papier, implementiere ich einen Interbankenmarkt, bestehend aus zwei Banken (eine
Spar- und eine Kreditbank), wie gesehen in de Walque et al. (2009), in ein Zwei-Länder-Modell
ähnlich wie in Faia (2005, 2008). Außerdem modelliere ich zwei verschiedene unkonventionelle
Maßnahmen, die während der Krise häufig verwendet wurden: Liquiditätsspritzen und Asset-
Swaps. Dieses Modell ermöglicht eine aussagekräftige Analyse der Wirkung von
unkonventioneller Geldpolitik auf den Wechselkurs, dadurch dass es die Übertragung von
unkonventionellen geldpolitischen Maßnahmen von den Banken auf die Wirtschaft erfasst.
Ergebnisse
Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass verschiedene unkonventionelle Maßnahmen unterschiedliche
Auswirkungen auf den Wechselkurs haben. Während Liquiditätsspritzen, die heimische
Währung kurzzeitig stärken, führen sie auf langer Sicht zu einer milden Abwertung. Im
Kontrast dazu führen Asset-Swaps zu einer kurzfristigen Abwertung aber auf langer Sicht
stärken sie die heimische Währung. Mit Bezug auf die Koordinierung unkonventioneller
Geldpolitik zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass wenn Zentralbanken den Einsatz von Liquiditätsspritzen
nicht koordinieren, diese zu einem höheren Anstieg des heimischen BIP führen, aber auch zu
einer höheren Schwankung der Inflationsrate, während die andere Wirtschaft negativ beeinflusst
wird durch den Rückgang des Wirtschaftswachstums. Im Gegenteil dazu stehen Asset-Swaps,
wenn Zentralbanken diese koordinieren, führt dies zu höherem BIP-Wachstum und geringeren
Schwankungen in der Inflationsrate in beiden Ländern. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit deuten
darauf hin, dass die Auswirkungen der unkonventionellen Geldpolitik auf dem Wechselkurs
nicht einheitlich sind und entscheidend von der Wahl des Instruments abhängen. Das Gleiche
gilt für die Koordinierung der unkonventionellen Geldpolitik.

Abstract
The impact of unconventional monetary policies on exchange rates and its spillovers to
other economies is not yet fully understood. In this paper I develop a two-country DSGE
model with interbank markets and endogenous default probabilities to analyze the cross-border
impacts of unconventional monetary policy. I examine the impact of two unconventional mea-
sures commonly used: central bank liquidity injections and asset swaps. I find that liquidity
injections lead to a short run appreciation of domestic currency, but a mild long run deprecia-
tion. In contrast, asset swaps cause a short run depreciation of domestic currency, but a long
run appreciation. Lastly, when both countries coordinate on the implementation of unconven-
tional policies, the model yields the following results: Non-coordinated liquidity injections lead
to higher increases with respect to output and inflation variation, but have negative spillovers
on the other economy in terms of lower growth. By contrast, coordinating asset swaps leads to
higher increases in output and lower fluctuation in inflation in both countries. The results of
this paper suggest that coordination in unconventional monetary policy may not always yield
an optimal outcome, and macroeconomic outcomes in both countries depend crucially on the
choice of instrument.

Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 41/2014
1 Introduction
The severe negative impact of the 2007-09 financial crisis on the global economy has brought
monetary authorities to the limits of their policies. Central banks all over the world had to apply
unprecedented measures after their conventional tools, such as decreasing the interest rate, became
ineffective when reaching the zero lower bound. In this process, central banks used very different
approaches. For instance, in December 2008 the Federal Reserve (Fed) intervened aggressively into
financial markets, within its framework of its quantitative easing program (QE1), by purchasing
up to USD 1350 billion (9.4% of GDP) in mortgage-backed securities. The ECB and other central
banks responded to the default of Lehman Brothers by providing EUR70 billion (0.7% of Euro zone
GDP) to the interbank market, while Bank of Japan provided JPY 5 billion (0.001% of GDP) and
Bank of England GBP 20 billion (1.4% of GDP). The use of unconventional measures continued
even after the financial crisis. In September 2012 the ECB announced outright purchases of gov-
ernment bonds to address a "malfunction in the monetary transmission mechanism". Shortly after
ECB's announcement, the Fed confirmed a third round of quantitative easing (QE3) to support
stronger economic recovery. Japan turned to aggressive quantitative easing measures paired with
increased government spending which are also known as "Abenomics" named after Shinzo Abe,
the current Prime Minister, who took over office in December 2012.
While these unconventional measures are generally viewed as helpful to the economy where they
are applied, some foreign country representatives strongly criticize their use. For example, in Octo-
ber 2010 China's trade minister, Chen Deming, argued that the Fed's second round of quantitative
easing would depreciate the value of the US Dollar causing an imported inflationary shock for
China. The finance minister of Brazil, Guido Mantega, associated the situation to an "interna-
tional currency war". This critical perception of unconventional measures contrast with the joint
cooperation of several central banks in November 2011, where the European Central Bank, the Fed-
eral Reserve, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss National
Bank coordinately supplied liquidity to global financial markets to ease frictions on credit supply.
These divergent views on the effect of unconventional monetary policy (UMP) lead to several ques-
tions. Do unconventional measures actually lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate? And if
so, which of the various measures cause a devaluation of domestic currency? Does central bank
coordination in unconventional monetary policy amplify spillovers or do they cancel each other out?
Concerning the empirical strand of literature, there are several papers which examine the im-
pact of unconventional measures on the exchange rate. However, these studies partly contradict
each other. For instance, Kuttner and Posen (2001) use a VAR analysis to assess the impact of
liquidity injections in Japan. According to their paper, a liquidity shock depreciates the yen, but
the depreciation is not statistically significant. They also find that quantitative easing initially
increases prices, but the effect is reversed after a few quarters. Honda et al. (2007) show that
quantitative easing increases output but has no significant effect on the price level because quan-
titative easing transmits through stock prices and not through general prices. A recent study by
Fratzscher, Lo Duca and Straub (2012) analyzes the effect of announcements and actual operations
of the Federal Reserve's unconventional monetary policy measures on portfolio allocations across
asset classes as well as on asset prices in 65 countries. Fratzscher et al. (2012) find that QE1 and
QE2 announcements as well as treasury purchases all weakened the US dollar but that liquidity
1
injections induced a US dollar appreciation. According to Fratzscher et al. (2012) QE1 and QE2
announcements, and treasury purchases triggered net outflows from US assets, thus depreciating
the US dollar, whereas liquidity injections aimed at repairing dysfunctional markets attracted cap-
ital into US markets and thus strengthened the US dollar.
Regarding the theoretical strand of literature, there is an increasing number of papers assessing
the impact of unconventional measures in a DSGE setup (e.g. Gertler and Karadi (2009), Gertler
and Kiyotaki (2010), Dib (2010), Gieck and Trazyck (2010)) but it is done using a closed economy
model. Consequently, these papers cannot contribute to the questions stated above. To the best of
my knowledge, there is only one paper by Dedola, Karadi, and Lombardo (2012, henceforth DKL)
which examines effects of unconventional measures in an open economy framework. However, DKL
concentrate on the assessment of cooperation and non-cooperation in unconventional policies in a
real economy model, therefore they are not able to address the behavior of the exchange rate or
inflation. The authors find that when economies are hit by a capital quality shock, unconventional
policies are generally welfare decreasing, i.e. both under cooperation and non-cooperation. When
they look at a financial shock, they find that central banks should aggressively offset the impact
of the shock by coordinating policies.
With this paper I am aiming at closing the gap in DSGE literature and analyze the behavior
of the exchange rate after the introduction of unconventional measures. Furthermore, I contribute
to the literature on coordination of monetary policy by looking at spillovers arising from simulta-
neous (coordination) and non-simultaneous (non-coordination) implementations of unconventional
measures. I interpret the simultaneous implementation of UMP in both countries as coordina-
tion in monetary policy whereas the sole implementation of UMP in only one country is regarded
as non-coordination in monetary policy. In order to address the question of exchange rate be-
havior, I develop a two country DSGE model similar to Faia (2005, 2008) but with a complete
international market1. The financial crisis proofed that banks are important in the transmission
of monetary policy and since most unconventional measures where aimed at banks, my model in-
cludes a meaningful interbank market with both financial and nominal frictions. Financial frictions
are introduced through endogenous default of banks and firms like in de Walque et al. (2009) and
nominal frictions are introduced through price adjustment cost `
a la Rotemberg like in Gieck and
Trazyck (2010). The most common unconventional measures used during the financial crisis are
replicated in this paper, liquidity injections and asset swaps. Liquidity injections are associated
with the creation of new money and expand the balance sheet of banks. Whereas asset swaps
of impaired loans in exchange for risk free assets affect the composition of banks' assets and the
quality of banks's balance sheets without changing balance sheet totals. The interbank market
consists of two banks per country, a deposit bank and a lending bank. Both banks face endogenous
balance sheet decisions and are constrained by capital regulation rules. The deposit bank collects
savings from domestic households and provides loans to domestic lending banks. Lending banks
supply loans to domestic capital producing firms and lend on the interbank market. Deposit banks
are net creditors whereas lending banks are net debtors in the interbank market. Both lending
banks and capital producing firms can default on their loans, but are subject to quadratic adjust-
ment costs if they do so. These defaults have the effect of financial accelerators. In particular, the
default of the capital producing firm leads to a default of the lending bank which in turn leads

to a decrease in credit supply on the interbank market by the deposit bank, thereby amplifying
the crisis. The interbank market is based on the model by de Walque et al. (2009) and allows
me to take into account the heterogeneity of the banking sector2. Unconventional measures are
implemented according to Dib (2010), namely through exogenous shocks to the banking sector.
However, there is no international interbank market, meaning that domestic banks do not borrow
or lend to foreign banks.
In this paper, I examine two scenarios for each unconventional measure either only one central
bank or both central banks introduce unconventional policies which I interpret as coordination
and non-coordination in monetary policy. I find that if only one central bank injects liquidity into
the interbank market, the exchange rate appreciates for 2 periods and depreciates thereafter. The
appreciation in the first 2 periods is caused by the increase in credit supply which also hikes up
prices and thus the exchange rate (which is defined by the terms of trade). As soon as credit supply
starts to fall in the third period (although it is still above its steady state) prices also decline lead-
ing to a depreciation of the exchange rate. By contrast, asset swaps lead to a slight depreciation of
the exchange rate in the first period and appreciate it thereafter. Asset swaps lead to a decrease in
credit growth in the first period which also depresses prices, thus depreciating the exchange rate.
After the first period, however, assets swaps increase credit supply together with prices leading to
an appreciation in the long run. Another result of this paper is that coordinating unconventional
policies is advisable in some cases but not in others, it mainly depends on the target of the central
bank and the instrument it wishes to use. For instance, in the case of liquidity injections, the best
outcome in terms of higher GDP is achieved with non-coordination. Then, however, the other
country will be affected by negative spillovers which lead to declines in GDP. With regard to infla-
tion, liquidity injections have the disadvantage that they increase inflation variation by the same
amount under coordination and non-coordination. By contrast, asset swaps increase output and
lower inflation variation the most only if coordinated. But even in the case of non-coordination, the
spillovers coming from asset swaps are generally positive. While both measures are able to increase
GDP, the impact of liquidity injections is substantially stronger than the impact of asset swaps.
This is due to way both measures are modeled: liquidity injections create additional resources
which banks can use to increase credit supply; asset swaps just change the quality of banks assets
not the amount of assets. Thus the impact of asset swaps is less pronounced. For the same reason
is variation in inflation substantially higher under liquidity injections than under assets swaps.
In a second step, I analyze if both measures are able to mitigate negative effects from a finan-
cial market shock. This financial shock is supposed to mitigate the beginning of the financial
crisis where fire sales in mortgage-backed-securities lead to substantial losses in the market book
of banks causing the default of financial institutions and triggering the financial crisis. In this
model, the financial market shock leads to a substantial loss in the market book of banks thereby
decreasing their profits and increasing their default rate. This in turn leads to lower credit supply
on the interbank market and thus to a credit crunch. When it comes to the ability of mitigating
negative effects from a financial shock, results show that liquidity injection perform better than
asset swaps. The impact of liquidity injections, for instance, is more pronounced than of asset

Walque et al. (2009).

swaps, where it is sufficient to inject liquidity as high as 5% of GDP to mitigate negative effects,
asset swaps need to be substantially higher in order to achieve the same impact. If both countries
experience a financial market shock the lowest decline in GDP after the shock is attained if a
central bank does not coordinate liquidity injections. This, however, has negative spillovers on the
other economy which will see even stronger declines in GDP due to the current account deficits
caused by the depreciating exchange rate. On top of that, the application of liquidity injections will
increase variation in inflation. In the case of assets swaps the opposite is true, the lowest decline in
GDP and lowest fluctuation in inflation after a financial shock is achieved if countries coordinate
asset swaps. If assets swaps are coordinated the initial decline in GDP is not as steep as in the
non-coordinated case and negative trade balances on either side are avoided. The results from the
financial shock experiment are in line with the general finding stated above, that non-coordinated
liquidity injections lead to higher GDP growth but have negative spillovers on the other economy,
whereas assets swaps have a stronger impact under coordination.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The setup of the two-country model is
introduced in section 2.2. The calibration of the model is documented in section 2.3. Section 2.4,
shows and evaluates the results from the impulse response analysis and section 2.5 concludes.
2 The Open Economy Model
The model consists of two countries, home and foreign. Each country has a representative house-
hold, an interbank market, a production sector, and a central bank. The interbank market consist
of two banks, a deposit bank and a lending bank. The deposit bank collects household's savings
and supplies loans to the lending bank. The lending bank relies on loans from deposit banks on
which it can default and provides loans to capital producing firms. The production sector consists
of capital goods, intermediate goods, and final goods producers. Capital producers obtain loans
from lending banks on which they can default and rent capital to the intermediate goods producing
firms. These firms use labor and capital to produce intermediate goods and face price adjustment
costs `
a-la Rotemberg (1982). Domestic and foreign intermediate goods are then processed into final
goods by the final good producers. The central bank sets interest rates according to a Taylor-type
policy rule and carries out unconventional measures. Since the model lacks any distinct fiscal or
supervisory authorities, I assume that the central bank takes over these roles as well. In particu-
lar, it supervises the banking sector through capital ratios. All agents are infinitely lived. Both
countries have the same technologies, preferences and operate in a complete international market.

a quadratic disutility term together with a target interest rate for deposits r. This is necessary in
order to determine Dh. It can be interpreted as a long-run optimal target in deposits from which
the households do not like to deviate.

above the minimum capital requirement is taken from Goodhart et al. (2005). This fixes the
minimum capital requirement ratio k = 0.08, w = 0.2 and w = 1.2 which are the respective weights
on interbank loans and on the market book4. Deposit banks are symmetric across countries, thus
foreign deposit banks face the same maximization problem.

Equation (8) shows the dynamics for own funds Fdb

. Own funds are increased each period by
a share vdb
of profits. Moreover, a small fraction db
of own funds is put into an insurance scheme
run by a public agent. This is due to the fact that deposit banks face losses on their interbank
loans. Equation (9) denotes the evolution of profits, where db
is the share which banks can recover
from defaulted interbank loans due to the insurance fund they pay in. The return on the market

is the interest rate set by the central bank. In contrast to lending banks it is
assumed that deposit banks never default.

where d
stands for a fixed cost of default5 which is independent from the total defaulted amount
5The expenses related to default consist of a variable part that relates to the notional of outstanding loans in the
economy and an additional fixed cost. Linearity of cost would imply indeterminacy for Equation (17). de Walque
et al. (2009) solve this technicality by splitting the expenses related to default into non-pecuniary costs that affect
utility and pecuniary costs that impact profits. However, as they acknowledge, this "double cost" lacks pure micro
foundations.

Equation (14) displays the dynamics for own funds of lending banks. Like deposit banks,
lending banks increase their own funds each period by a share vlb

today is equal to the marginal discounted quadratic search cost of tomorrow in addition to a fixed
default cost parameter. Equation (25) states that the price for capital is equal to the differential
between today's and tomorrow's shadow value.

The intermediate goods production sector consists of a continuum of monopolistically competitive
firms each maximizing profits f

which is
supplied by households, and an optimal amount of capital K (i)
t
which is supplied by capital
producers. Intermediate goods producers also set the price level where they have to take into
account price adjustment costs ´

inflation is dependent on world demand for the domestic intermediate good and expectations on
future domestic inflation.

3 Calibration
The two countries are assumed to be symmetric in every way. Table 1 in the Appendix shows the
calibrated parameters.
Households.
The elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic goods  is equal to 1.5 as in Backus
et al. (1992). The export over GDP ratio 1 -  is set to 0.2 which is compatible with Kollmann
(2004). Households leisure utility parameter m is deduced from the model and is equal to 3.14.
Production Sector.
Employment is normalized to N = 0.2 which means that employers work 20% of total available
hours 8. The capital share in the Cobb-Douglas production function is set to µ = 0.3 which is
in accordance with the capital share of 30% observed in the euro area and the US. It is assumed
that capital stock is 10 times higher than production. Capital depreciation rate is set to  = 0.03.
This implies an investment ratio to output of 0.3 =  K
Y
. Although, in the standard RBC literature
capital stock is usually 8 times higher than production, this is needed to avoid negative search
cost  on the defaulted amount. The autoregression coefficient in the technology equation a
is
equal 0.95 which is standard in the RBC literature. Following Faia (2007) the price elasticity of
demand  is set to 6 and the price adjustment cost parameter  is set to 17.5. The value for the
default rate of capital producing firms is equal to 5% (and therefore t
= 0.95 in steady state)
7Due to symmetry, the same holds for the foreign lending bank.
8This is in line with real data, where 0.2 = (40  44)/(52  7  24)
11
which is inferred from the US courts and the Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly pre-crisis data
on business bankruptcies. The data are based on the number of non-financial corporations that
go bankrupt. This enables me to derive  = 103.04 the variable default cost parameter of capital
producing firms and dc
= 0.001 the fixed default cost parameter.
Banking Sector.
I set the deposit rate to r = 0.35%, so the annual deposit rate is equal to 1.4%. The market book
offers a mere of  = 1%, which is consistent with the average quarterly return of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average Index from 1980Q1 to 2012Q2. Lending banks default rate is set to  = 0.98
which is derived from the pre-crisis data provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
These data encompasses the number of bank failures. When calibrating the model I impose Dh/Llb
to be around 2 and Idb/Llb = Ilb/Lc around 0.5, which is in line with pre-crisis statistics of the
Federal Reserve System. The market book for each bank equals to the amount of loans to capital
producers: B
db
= B
lb
= Llb. The weights of bank assets are aligned to the solvability regulation
of the Basel agreement. Loans to banks with a rating of AAA to AA- (S&P) have to be weighted
with 20%, thus w = 0.2. A loan to an enterprise with a rating of A+ to A- (S&P) has to be
weighted with 50% thus w = 0.5. The capital ratio is set to k = 8%. Banks are supposed to
allocate half of their profits to own funds (vb
= vl
= 0.5) and the remaining 50% are consumed
immediately. Through the insurance scheme I assume that banks can recover 80% of their bad
loans; in exchange, banks must pay a premia of 6% and 7% of their funds (db
= 0.06 for deposit
banks and lb
= 0.07 for lending banks, rates differ due to differences in default rates for firms
and lending banks) in order to benefit from this provision. The fixed default cost parameter for
the lending bank d
is equal to 0.05. Other parameters - default cost parameter  and own funds
utility parameters for both bank types, dF b
, dF l
, bF b
, and bF l
- are inferred from the restrictions
mentioned above.
Central Bank.
The Taylor-type monetary policy rule contains parameters that are set according to specifications
used in the literature and satisfy the Taylor rule principle (µr
= 0.8, Q
= 1.7. Regression
parameters for all unconventional monetary tools (·)
are set to 0.85.
4 Quantitative Results

line represents responses when only the domestic central bank applies this unconventional measure
and the dashed line represents responses when both the domestic and foreign central bank provide
liquidity to lending banks at the same time. In accordance with the AR(1) processes described
above, the liquidity shock decays at a rate of 85% per quarter.
The responses are expressed as percentage deviations from their respective steady states. After

This figure shows impulse responses after a liquidity injection shock to banks which is equal to

introduce liquidity injections. The responses are expressed as percentage deviations from their
respective steady states. "D" stands for domestic economy and "F" for foreign economy.
a non-coordinated liquidity injection, the exchange rate declines which means it appreciates9 in the
first two periods by 0.42% but depreciates persistently thereafter. In this model the exchange rate
is determined by the terms of trade (tott
= P
t
/Pt
) that is the relationship between export (P
t
)
and import prices (Pt
). Figure 1 shows that in the first two periods liquidity injections lead to
an increase in domestic export prices while prices in the foreign economy (import prices) decline.
Prices increase due to the increase in credit supply which in turn increases GDP and domestic de-
mand. Prices in the foreign country decline amid the symmetry of the countries and the complete
international asset market structure of this model with its consequent risk sharing assumption
er
t
= 
t
t
(see equation (6)). This interaction in prices is mirrored in the response of the domestic
trade balance. It is negative as long as import prices are lower than export prices, leading to higher
demand for imports. It is turning positive as soon as export prices are below import prices. From
the behavior in the banking sector we see that liquidity injections lead to a substantial increase in
credit supply to firms (+20%) in the domestic economy which in turn boost GDP in the first period
by more than 2.5%. However the shoot up in credit is not persistent and falls below its steady
state after 5 periods as banks have to pay back the liquidity injections. Carried by a positive trade
balance in the long run, GDP returns to its steady state after 10 periods. Liquidity injections in
the domestic economy transmit to the foreign economy through the risk sharing condition. Since
both countries are symmetric, the opposite is happening in the foreign economy. Loans to firms
(-10%) and GDP (-1%) decline.
When both central banks introduce liquidity injections simultaneously (dashed line) variables in
9The exchange rate is defined in terms of the domestic currency, e.g. if the domestic currency is given in US
Dollar and we assume the exchange rate is 1.35, meaning that Euro is worth 1.35 US Dollars, then if the exchange
rate declines to 1.2 US Dollars that means that the US Dollar appreciated or that the Euro depreciated.

both countries will have the same response to the shock due to the complete structure of the in-
ternational market. Thus, the exchange rate, terms of trade, export and import prices, and the
trade balance do not move. Now we see the same responses in both economies, loans to firms
increase (but only by half as much as in the case of non-coordination) leading to a slightly lower
impact on GDP which increases by about 1.5% in the first period instead of 2.5% as in the case
of non-coordination. Also, domestic GDP falls below its steady state after eight periods whereas
under non-coordination it remained above its steady state for 10 periods.

Results for the domestic economy are in the upper right corner of each box.
In Figure 2, I compare the discounted deviations in GDP from their steady state and in Figure
3, I look at the discounted root mean squared deviations of inflation in the case of coordination and
non-coordination. By computing the present values of these deviations I follow the approach of
Angeloni et al. (2010), this allows me to sum up the intertemporal effects of various unconventional
measures in one indicator10. The observation that GDP in the domestic country is higher in the
case of non-coordination is confirmed by the present values. If the domestic central bank wants

to increase GDP, higher output increases over time can be attained with non-coordination (+11%
vs. +6.52%). However, in the case of non-coordination, GDP in the foreign economy will be
considerably lower (-4.5%) due to the decline in credit supply and the negative trade balance. This
leads to the suggestion that the foreign economy should immediately use liquidity injections when
it observes the domestic economy using this measure. With regard to inflation, Figure 3 shows that
liquidity injections also increase fluctuations in inflation. When only one or both countries are using
liquidity injections inflation variation increases by 0.07%. In the case of non-coordination, inflation
variation will be higher in the country with liquidity injections with some inflation fluctuations
spilling over into the other economy.
4.1.2 Asset swaps
Figure 4 shows an asset swap shock to lending banks which is equal to 5% of GDP. In comparison
to a liquidity shock, the asset swap shock differs strongly in direction and magnitude but is more
persistent. This is due to the modeling of the asset swap shock. Note that the asset swap enters the
profit function of lending banks only in time t, as I assume that the lending banks are swapping
a fraction of loans against assets immediately, there is no intertemporal effect. Furthermore,
the balance sheet of lending banks is not increasing (like for liquidity injections where they get
additional funds) but it is altered in its composition, i.e. quality, this is why the impact is lower
in comparison to liquidity injections but more persistent.

This figure shows impulse responses after an asset swap shock to banks which is equal to 5% of

When only the domestic lending banks are able to swap loans against central bank bonds, the
exchange rate depreciates for one period and appreciates thereafter. This is due to the impact of
asset swaps on export and import prices and thus on the terms of trade. Assets swaps cause a

decline in credit supply thereby absorbing liquidity and decreasing demand which causes a decline
in prices. Thus after a non-coordinated asset swap, export prices decline for one period while im-
port prices increase. This in turn, leads to a positive trade balance in the first period as domestic
exports are cheaper than foreign exports. This effect is reversed in the second period when credit
supply starts to grow slowly. The impact of asset swaps on the quality of banks assets is built over
time rather than instantaneously. Since in each period (as long as the asset swap shock prevails)
banks are able to swap only a fraction of their "bad assets", they are only able to increase loan
supply in the next period by a fraction. Thus banks need several periods to increase loan supply
above its steady state. Loan supply needs about three periods to increase above its steady state;
the same time GDP needs to increase above its steady.
Amid the risk sharing condition, the opposite is happening in the foreign economy. Credit supply
to foreign firms increases slightly in the first period and persistently declines thereafter. This initial
increase in credit triggers an increase in output. However in the following period GDP declines
immediately to its steady state but only to increase again in the third period, this time driven by
a positive trade balance. Foreign output remains above its steady state as long as foreign prices
are below domestic prices.
When turning to the assessment of the impulse responses in the case of coordination (dashed
line), we see that amid the complete international market assumption real exchange rates, terms
of trade, export and import prices, and the trade balance do not move since both countries are
experiencing the exact same shock at the same time. Then impulse responses in the domestic
and foreign economy move in the same way, credit supply decreases initially in both countries
(but not as strong as in the case of non-coordination) leading to declines in GDP but this time
declines in domestic GDP are not as high as in the case of non-coordination since the negative
trade balance is circumvented under coordination. Although foreign GDP is now decreasing in
the first period as well, the comparison of present values of GDP deviations under coordination
and non-coordination in Figure 5 reveals that both countries can attain higher GDP increases over
time if they coordinate asset swaps. Even if countries do not coordinate asset swaps, the other
economy will experience positive spillovers on GDP, as assets swaps lead to positive trade balances
in the foreign economy and thus to higher GDP. In the case of inflation (Figure 6), both countries

are able to attain a slightly lower inflation variation when policies are implemented simultaneously
since under coordination the fluctuation in export and import prices is avoided.
4.2 Experiments
In this section I analyze the ability of both unconventional measures to moderate downturns in
economic activity after a negative market book shock. The market book shook is equal to the one
used by deWalque et al. (2010) and is supposed to mitigate the beginning of the financial crisis
where banks experienced large losses in their market book after investments in mortgage backed
securities devaluated dramatically, resulting in a credit crunch. In my model, the market book
shock is equivalent to a sudden decrease in market book returns : t
= (1-rho
)+rhot-1-u
t
with rho
equal to 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.1. This means that it takes about a year for
the shock to disappear. In both experiments the setup is the following: In the first period both
economies, domestic and foreign, are hit by this strong negative market book shock. In the second
period there is either no intervention, or only the domestic, or both central banks intervene and
either inject liquidity or allow for asset swaps. In order to model this experiment in Dynare, I have
to compute the impulse responses within a deterministic setup. This means, that agents have full
foresight. This is arguably a strong assumption, however when comparing the impulse responses
with the ones under the stochastic setup (as described in section 4.1) the impulse responses move
in the exact same direction and differences are marginal. Moreover, in Gieck and Traczyk (2010),
we show that the difference in results between a stochastic and a deterministic setup for this model
in a closed economy setup is very small.
4.2.1 Negative Market Book Shock: Liquidity injections
Figure 7 presents impulse responses for three different scenarios. In the first scenario, No UMP,
there is a negative market book shock in both countries which decreases the return on the market
book of banks by 200 percent (so it becomes negative). In the second scenario, Non-Coordinated

line) which are equal to 5% of GDP. In the third scenario, Coordinated UMP, both central banks
intervene in the second period with liquidity injections (dashed line).

This figure shows impulse responses after a negative market book shock which is equal to one
standard deviation. The dotted line represents responses with no interventions by the central
banks after the shock occurred. The solid line shows responses when only the domestic central
bank is injecting liquidity to banks in the 2nd period. The dashed line represent responses when
both the domestic and foreign central bank are injecting liquidity to banks in the 2nd period. "D"
stands for domestic economy and "F" for foreign economy.
Figure 8 shows that the negative market book shock leads to a credit crunch, banks reduce their
loan supply to firms which in turn leads to a decrease in GDP. GDP in both countries declines
by 0.47% in the first period and remains below its steady state for the remaining 19 quarters.
Loans decrease by -2.36% in the first period and remain below their steady state for 10 quarters.
Since both countries are symmetric the exchange rate and terms of trade do not move as both
countries experience the same market book shock at the same time. The blue solid line shows that
if only the domestic central bank intervenes with liquidity injections after the market book shook
it can mitigate a credit crunch. Loans to firms increase substantially and thereby stimulate GDP.
Liquidity injections lead to increases in export prices which lead to an appreciation of the real
exchange rate of the domestic economy. These increased prices cause a decline in exports and thus
a negative trade balance for 5 periods. In the foreign country, the increased demand for foreign
goods initially accelerates economic activity but due to depreciation of the domestic exchange rate
in the long run the demand for foreign goods weakens which leads to a persistent decrease in foreign
GDP. When both central bank coordinate policies and inject liquidity after observing the market
book shock, the black dashed line shows that both countries can avoid a credit crunch but in that
case GDP in the domestic economy is not increasing as much as it would under non-coordination.
The impulse on loans and GDP under coordination is lower than under non-coordination, as the
expected positive impact on GDP through a surplus in the trade balance is not possible in the case
of coordination.
Figure 8 confirms the results from the impulse responses, in that liquidity injections can mod-
erate declines in GDP substantially. But it also shows that the domestic economy would achieve

the highest increases in GDP if it does not coordinate liquidity injections with the foreign econ-
omy (+2.51%). Then the decline in GDP for the foreign economy would be even higher (-4.29%)
than in the case with no interventions by both central banks (-2.59%). Thus, the foreign central
bank should also inject liquidity after a market book shock if it observes that the domestic central
bank is using this measure. Figure 9 shows that liquidity injections increase inflation variation.
In the case of non-coordination they even lead to slightly higher variations in the other economy's
inflation (after a market book shock) as it is forced to adjust. If both central banks coordinate
interventions they receive higher inflation variations than in the case of no interventions as liquidity
interventions generally increase fluctuations in inflation.

This figure shows impulse responses after a negative market book shock which is equal to a decline
in banks' returns by 200%. The dotted line represents responses with no interventions by the central
banks after the shock occurred. The solid line shows responses when only the domestic central
bank is carrying out assets swaps in the second period. The dashed line represents responses when
both the domestic and foreign central bank are carrying out assets swaps in the second period.
"D" stands for domestic economy and "F" for foreign economy.
the second period which are equal to 50% of GDP11 after the return on the market book of banks
declines by 200%. The impulse responses show that assets swaps have also the ability to increase
credit supply and GDP after a market book shock. However only in the long run, not instantly
like in the case of liquidity injections. Moreover, the impact of asset swaps is less pronounced
compared to quantitative measures as also seen in section 4.1.1. In the case of coordination, the
dashed line shows that domestic GDP not only passes its steady state one period earlier than in
the case of non-coordination but the rise in GDP is also higher. This is due to the impact on
lending, if both countries coordinate asset swaps initial decreases in domestic loans are lower than
in the non-coordinated case.
Figure 11 shows that asset swaps if non-coordinated are able to moderate decreases in present
value GDP from -2.59% to 0.57%. And even in the case of non-coordination, the foreign economy
benefits from the positive spillovers on its economy in terms of lower GDP declines (-2.7%) due
to the positive trade balance in the foreign economy. However, the strongest impact assets swaps
develop in the case of coordination leading even to positive increases in GDP after a negative
financial market book shock. And the same is true for inflation (Figure 12), the lowest inflation
variation is reached when central banks coordinate asset swaps (+0,056%) since asset swaps absorb
liquidity.
11For visibility reasons I had to increase asset swaps to 50% of GDP. If assets swaps would be equal to 5% of
GDP (like liquidity injections), the impact would be hardly visible in the impulse responses compared to the market
book shock.

5 Conclusion
Unconventional measures while viewed as helpful and expansionary to the country where they
are applied, are viewed with suspicion by foreign counterparts, even declared as weapons in a
"currency war" between nations as they are commonly believed to depreciate the currency of the
applying economy and thereby boosting its exports. However, empirical literature shows contradic-
tory results, in that unconventional measures not always depreciate the currency and that different
unconventional measure can lead to different outcomes (see Fratzscher et al. (2012), Honda et al.
(2007)). Literature which tries to address this question from a theoretical standpoint by using a
DSGE model with an interbank market is thin, since it was broadly assumed that financial agents
do not mater due to the Modigliani-Miller theorem. The financial crisis dramatically showed the
relevance of financial institutions and their importance in the transmission of monetary policy
especially unconventional monetary policy. For this reason, it is important to address the question
of the impact of unconventional measures on the exchange rate in a model with a meaningful
interbank market imbedded in a two country economy.
21
In this paper I therefore propose an open economy model with an interbank market to analyze the
impact of various unconventional measures on the exchange rate. I document that different uncon-
ventional monetary policy measures do affect the exchange rate differently. In my model liquidity
injections lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate in the short run but to a depreciation in
the long run and the opposite is true for assets swaps (depreciation in the short run, appreciation
in the long run). This is due to the impact of liquidity injections on the economy which lead to an
increase in credit supply and domestic demand in the short run thus raising domestic prices and
through the terms of trade appreciating the domestic currency. This effect, however, is reversed
in the long run; as soon as credit supply starts to decrease, domestic prices start to decrease as
well causing a depreciation of the domestic exchange rate which in turn leads to a positive trade
balance in the domestic economy thereby lifting domestic output while foreign output is depressed.
Asset swaps have the contrary impact on the exchange rate, in the short run they absorb liquidity
leading to a decline in prices and thus to an depreciation but in the long run they cause an ap-
preciation of the exchange rate as they increase credit supply and prices which leads to a negative
trade balance and lower growth. My results for the behavior of the exchange rate in the short run,
are in line with recent empirical findings see Fratscher et al. (2012), while my long run results are
in line with the general economic and political debate in terms of currency wars. Furthermore,
my paper shows that unconventional measures can have significant negative spillovers on other
economies in terms of negative trade balances and thus lower GDP growth as well as increased
variations in inflation. These results support the critical view of foreign country representatives
on the excessive usage of unconventional measures, especially in the case of liquidity injections,
which in my model result in higher GDP rates in the country where they are applied but lead to
decreases in economic activity in the other country when non-coordinated. This results leads to
the conclusion that the other country should also inject liquidity when it observes a country (with
which it has substantial trading relations) applying this measure. Asset swaps, on the contrary,
unfold the strongest impact when coordinated. And even in the case of non-coordination, they
still have positive spillovers on the other economy. Another result of this paper is that liquidity
injections better mitigate negative effects from a financial shock than asset swaps. While it is
sufficient to inject liquidity as high as 5% of GDP to mitigate negative effects, asset swaps need to
be substantially higher to see the same change.
This paper contributes to the question of exchange rate behavior and coordination of uncon-
ventional monetary policy in an international environment. It has important implications for the
implementation of unconventional measures and can contribute to the debate on "currency wars".
It also provides a versatile model which could be altered in various directions to be useful for
related research questions such as the exit from unconventional measures.
