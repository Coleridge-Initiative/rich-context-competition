Commentary
Official statistics and Big Data
Peter Struijs, Barteld Braaksma and Piet JH Daas
Abstract
The rise of Big Data changes the context in which organisations producing official statistics operate. Big Data provides
opportunities, but in order to make optimal use of Big Data, a number of challenges have to be addressed. This stimulates
increased collaboration between National Statistical Institutes, Big Data holders, businesses and universities. In time, this
may lead to a shift in the role of statistical institutes in the provision of high-quality and impartial statistical information to
society. In this paper, the changes in context, the opportunities, the challenges and the way to collaborate are addressed.
The collaboration between the various stakeholders will involve each partner building on and contributing different
strengths. For national statistical offices, traditional strengths include, on the one hand, the ability to collect data and
combine data sources with statistical products and, on the other hand, their focus on quality, transparency and sound
methodology. In the Big Data era of competing and multiplying data sources, they continue to have a unique knowledge of
official statistical production methods. And their impartiality and respect for privacy as enshrined in law uniquely position
them as a trusted third party. Based on this, they may advise on the quality and validity of information of various sources.
By thus positioning themselves, they will be able to play their role as key information providers in a changing society.

Introduction
The advent of Big Data is expected to have a big impact
on organisations for which the production and analysis
of data and information is core business. National
Statistical Institutes (NSIs) are such organisations.
They are responsible for official statistics, which are
heavily used by policy-makers and other important
players in society. Arguably, the way NSIs take up
Big Data will eventually have implications for all of
society.
Official statistics play a key role in modern society.
NSIs aim at providing information on all important
aspects of society in an impartial way, and according
to the highest scientific standards. Information that ful-
fils these demands is used in public discussion, forms
the basis of policy decisions, is required for business
use, feeds scientific research, is used in education and
so on. Official statistics can only meet this demand if
they can be trusted. In advanced societies, official stat-
istics are often taken for granted, but where trust is
lacking, society misses an important pillar for informed
discussion and evidence-based policy-making.
Professional standards play a vital role in securing
trust in official statistics. Statisticians have their own
ethics code (United Nations, 2013), which includes an
absolute respect for the confidentiality of data provided
by respondents. Data collected for statistical purposes
may never be disclosed and may never be used for other
purposes. At the level of the European Union (EU),
quality norms have been codified in the so-called
Statistics Code of Practice (Eurostat, 2014). The trust
earned by respecting professional standards is also the
basis for a privileged position of NSIs in respect of data
acquisition. Many NSIs have access by law to govern-
ment data sources and have the power to collect data
from other parties, often without having to pay the
provider. Moreover, for statistical purposes, many
NSIs are allowed to link data from different sources.

Given this role for NSIs, what does the emergence of
Big Data mean for official statistics? This question is
addressed in this contribution, but as we will see, there
are many reasons why the role of NSIs in the Big Data
era is not `given'. In order to keep a sound and trusted
basis of information for society to rely on, we argue
that NSIs may have to adapt to the changing context
in which they operate.
Official statistics in a changing context
In respect of information, society is changing rapidly.
For example, there is an enormous growth of data that
is gathered and recorded in myriad ways: from satellite
and sensory data, to social network and transactional
data and so on. The availability of data is also expand-
ing and becoming the foundation of business models.
Information is becoming more visual and interactive.
Information and communication technology is becom-
ing ever more advanced, processing power and data
storage capacity is continuously rising, cloud solutions
are emerging and applications are becoming more intel-
ligent. These developments have been described in more
depth and detail by many observers, such as Mayer-
Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier (2013).
These changes have many impacts on societies. For
one, the increased gathering of data and the commer-
cial and social possibilities of data usage influence
public opinion on privacy. Some are concerned if
their data are re-used without their consent, for com-
mercial reasons or otherwise. Others do not mind so
much, if this means that services are provided for
free. Many people voluntarily share information on
social networks without caring for privacy. People
have less patience to fill in questionnaires, especially if
the data requested have been registered somewhere else
already. Government agencies are expected to be more
forthcoming in providing data. Governments have
reacted to the changes by formulating policies on, for
instance, open data and availability of public sector
information, also at the EU level (European Union,
2013).
How have NSIs responded? Until around the 1980s,
data were essentially a scarce commodity with a high
price. Before the era of Big Data, information was not
readily available but had to be collected for a particular
purpose. Official statistical information based on survey
data had a unique value: there simply was no alterna-
tive. For example, population census data, collected
door to door, was immensely valuable to policy-
makers, researchers and other users. In the last few
decades, data collected by public administrations have
become increasingly accessible for statistical purposes,
stimulated in part by IT developments. Statistical data
collection by means of questionnaires was
supplemented and increasingly replaced by administra-
tive data sources. Nowadays, some countries do not
conduct extensive population surveys anymore but
compile census statistics by combining and analysing
data from several administrative sources. NSIs
became more integrated in the information architecture
of the government. In this way, the burden on persons
and businesses to respond to questionnaires was con-
siderably reduced.
In the context of all of these developments, the infor-
mation provided by NSIs still remained unique. In par-
ticular, the possibility of combining data from different
sources made official statistics even more valuable,
since in many countries no other organisation was pos-
itioned to do so. In parallel, efforts also increased to
standardise and harmonise these various sources of offi-
cial statistics, especially in the EU. Supported by legis-
lation, official statistics in the EU are now considered a
system, the so-called European Statistical System,
or ESS.1
However, Big Data is changing the environment of
the NSIs once more as data scarcity is becoming less of
an issue. For NSIs, there are potential benefits as new
data sources and opportunities emerge. But it also
makes the products of NSIs potentially less unique,
since other players in the information market may
start ­ and have actually started ­ producing statistics,
for instance, on inflation, such as the Billion Prices
Project of MIT.2
Let us first look at the opportunities for NSIs offered
by Big Data. There is a huge potential for new statistics
(Daas et al., 2013). Location data for mobile phones
could be used for almost instantaneous daytime popu-
lation and tourism statistics (De Jonge et al., 2012).
Social media messages could be used for several types
of indicators, such as an early indicator of consumer
confidence. Inflation figures could be derived from price
information on the web, and so on. In addition, Big
Data sources may be used to substitute or supplement
more traditional data sources, such as questionnaire
and administrative data. For instance, data collection
by questionnaire on road use may not be necessary
anymore if detailed traffic loop data, i.e. data from sen-
sors in roads, become available (Struijs and Daas,
2013).
However, in order to realise these opportunities, a
number of challenges have to be overcome, which are
generally applicable to all uses of Big Data as an infor-
mation source and as such are not unique to NSIs.
Challenges and issues
Some of the biggest challenges that statisticians face in
their use of Big Data concern methodology. Many Big
Data sources, such as social media messages, are
2 Big Data & Society
composed of observational data and are not deliber-
ately designed for data analysis, and thus do not have
a well-defined target population, structure and quality.
This makes it difficult to apply traditional statistical
methods, based on sampling theory (Daas and Puts,
2014a). The unstructured nature of many Big Data
sources makes it even more difficult to extract meaning-
ful statistical information. For many Big Data sources,
the interpretation of the data and its relationship with
social phenomena of interest is far from obvious. For
example, public Facebook messages in the Netherlands
clearly reflect general sentiment in some sense, but it is
far from clear how exactly (Daas and Puts, 2014b).
Moreover, if such data are to be used as a source for
a population sentiment indicator, one would like to
know the relationship between the population of per-
sons writing public messages on Facebook and the
population at large. This is challenging without falling
back to surveys. Furthermore, the population of per-
sons using social media is likely to change over time,
making a comparison to the population at large even
more challenging.
For NSIs, a key question concerns how the quality
of official statistics can be guaranteed if they are based
on Big Data. To address this, new methodologies and
forms of interpretation need to be developed. Take for
example mobile phones. If data from mobile phone
providers are used for statistics on, say, population
mobility, the statistician has to interpret anonymised
detailed call records from individual phones and
derive information about the behaviour of the people
using them. That means dealing with the fact that mea-
sureable phone activity may vary during the day, some
persons may have multiple mobile phones or none, chil-
dren carry mobile phones which are registered to their
parents, phones may be switched off, etc. For social
media, even more questions arise such as who is the
author of a message. While some methodological reme-
dies have already been developed to some extent, such
as deriving the gender and age of a social media user by
the known correlation between sex, age and choice of
words, these still pose a challenge, as explained above.
Privacy and legal issues form another challenge. The
prevention of the disclosure of the identity of individ-
uals is an imperative, but this is difficult to guarantee
when dealing with Big Data. Since legislation typically
lags behind the emergence of new social phenomena,
the legal situation for cases involving Big Data is not
always clear. In such cases, one may have to fall back
on ethical standards to decide on whether and how to
use Big Data. Other legal issues relate to copyright and
the ownership of data. Even if data may legally be used,
this does not imply that it is wise or appropriate to do
so. Of critical importance is the implication of any use
of Big Data for the public perception of an NSI as this
has a direct impact on trust in official statistics. These
concerns have been heightened by the revelations that
intelligence agencies are among the most active Big
Data users. For NSIs, it is critical that these concerns
be addressed through practices such as being transpar-
ent about what and how Big Data sources are used.
Other mechanisms could also be developed. For exam-
ple, in some cases it might be feasible to adopt informed
consent approaches. Some mobile phone subscription
contracts, for instance, offer an opt out to the sub-
scriber for using their data for other purposes than
providing the phone service. If the opt out rate is not
too high, this does not seriously affect the usability of
mobile phone data for statistical purposes.
Another obvious challenge is the processing, storage
and transfer of large data sets. Technological advances
like increases in computing power, larger storage facil-
ities and high bandwidth data channels may partly
solve these issues. Having data processed at the
source, thus preventing the transfer of large data sets
and the duplication of storage, may also be considered.
These technological challenges include mechanisms for
ensuring the security of data, which is of the utmost
importance because of privacy and confidentiality con-
cerns and makes, for example, cheap cloud-based solu-
tions less attractive.
Another issue is the possible volatility of Big Data
sources, given the fact that official statistics often take
the form of time series analyses. For many users, the
continuity of these series is of the utmost importance.
Still another issue is the skills required for dealing with
Big Data. Modern data scientists may be better
equipped than traditionally trained statisticians.
Probably more important is the need for a different
mind-set as the use of Big Data may imply a paradigm
shift, including an increased and modified use of mod-
elling techniques (Daas and Puts, 2014a; Struijs and
Daas, 2013).
Collaboration
Faced with these challenges, NSIs have recognised the
necessity of not working in isolation but collaborating
with each other and others outside the community of
official statistics. This collaboration is often exploratory
and may be aimed at sharing knowledge and experi-
ences, but there are already examples of collaboration
that go further.
From the perspective of NSIs, several types of part-
ners are of interest. First of all, the potential providers
of Big Data are essential partners: if they do not grant
access to their data, the story is over before it starts.
Data owners have their own concerns and, like NSIs,
they are subject to privacy rules. This may complicate
collaboration even if they have a positive outlook and
Struijs et al. 3
approach. But since Big Data sources are not designed
for statistical use, such collaboration is also essential in
order to obtain good knowledge of the provenance of
such sources. Additionally, for statistical production, it
may be more efficient to have data processed at the site
of collection and storage. In such cases, the assumption
that data can be provided for free may no longer hold.
On the other hand, statisticians also have much to offer
such as providing analytic insights that may help data
owners understand their data better. Doing complex
statistical analyses is core business for NSIs, but not
for, say, a mobile phone company. In these and other
ways, the relationship with data providers could poten-
tially become true partnerships. For example, one spe-
cific role that NSIs could play is that of a trusted third
party. In a competitive market, competitors will be
reluctant to share sensitive data among each other.
But they might be willing to share it with an NSI
who compiles statistical information that is beneficial
to all.
Collaboration between NSIs and academia may
grow as well. Universities have historically been natural
partners for NSIs. It stands to reason that such collab-
oration will extend to the field of Big Data, for instance,
in solving methodological problems, developing tech-
nical solutions and training future data scientists.
Such collaboration is also being supported by public
funders who are facilitating research and innovation
partnerships through targeted grants.3 By working in
partnership, researchers in universities and NSIs could
better leverage such opportunities.
Furthermore, there are many commercial partners
with which NSIs could collaborate. Google and
Facebook are two examples for which Big Data forms
the core of their business model. Their knowledge and
the data to which they have access may be very relevant
to NSIs. IT companies also possess relevant knowledge
on Big Data processing and storage, security, cloud pro-
cessing, etc. Apart from the provision of paid services,
collaboration may be of interest to them with a view to
obtaining statistical expertise and for benchmarking or
validating their information products.
Collaboration between NSIs in the field of Big Data
has already started. Big Data has become a prominent
subject at many statistical meetings and conferences in
Europe, such as the 2013 New Techniques and
Technologies for Statistics (NTTS) conference,4 a sci-
entific conference organised by Eurostat, and the `ESS
Big Data event 2014' in Rome.5 The directors-general
of all European NSIs met in Scheveningen in
September 2013 to learn about Big Data and adopted
the Scheveningen Memorandum (DGINS, 2013). This
memorandum calls for an international strategic
approach to Big Data and plans for the adoption of
an action plan and roadmap by mid-2014.
For some time already, Big Data has been an
important topic for the UNECE, the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe. Collaboration at
that level resulted in an overview paper about the
implications of Big Data for official statistics
(UNECE, 2013a). Seminars have been held, facilitat-
ing the exchange of knowledge, for instance, on stat-
istical data collection.6 In 2014, the UNECE went one
step further in facilitating cross-national work through
a project with the following stated objectives:
a. to identify, examine and provide guidance for stat-
istical organisations to act upon the main strategic
and methodological issues that Big Data poses for
the official statistics industry;
b. to demonstrate the feasibility of efficient production
of both novel products and `mainstream' official
statistics using Big Data sources, and the possibility
to replicate these approaches across different
national contexts;
c. to facilitate the sharing across organisations of
knowledge, expertise, tools and methods for the
production of statistics using Big Data sources
(UNECE, 2013b).
The future of official statistics
What does the advent of Big Data mean for official
statistics? As we have argued, it provides many oppor-
tunities. But in order to make optimal use of Big
Data, a number of issues have to be addressed. This
calls for increased collaboration with private and aca-
demic partners who have access to specific Big Data
sources and knowledge, but also between NSIs. The
relationship between the various stakeholders will
involve each partner building on and contributing dif-
ferent strengths and will likely result in flexible net-
works. Such networks are flexible in the sense that
membership of the network and the contribution of
partners depend on actual needs instead of being
fixed in advance for a long time.
Seen from the viewpoint of NSIs, there are also
potential risks. Official statistics are facing more com-
petition. In a time of growing data abundance, generat-
ing statistical information that is potentially relevant to
society is no longer an activity intrinsically restricted to
NSIs. And even the traditional advantage of NSIs,
being legally allowed to collect data and combine
data sources, is eroding. It may not be possible to com-
bine survey data and administrative data with Big Data
sources at the micro-level, which reduces the relative
disadvantage traditionally faced by the competition.
For some statistics, Big Data sources cannot be eas-
ily envisaged as alternatives to more traditional
4 Big Data & Society
data sources. This certainly holds for official figures on
government finance and economic growth, which are
heavily used for decision-making at both the national
and international level. But, given the increasing com-
petition that data generated by other sources is present-
ing to the role of NSIs as bearers of official statistics, a
strategic reassessment is needed. This could include
fundamental questions such as whether statistics
based on Big Data sources should be a core activity
of NSIs, or if some data and information should be
provided by other market actors, or if NSIs can or
should provide new services in this context.
But by posing these questions, we return to the basic
premise that society's access to impartial statistical
information must be maintained at all times, either by
NSIs or other parties. In choosing a position, NSIs
could build on and promote their strengths and
unique position. Especially at a time of competing
and multiplying data sources, their impartiality and
respect for privacy as enshrined in law uniquely pos-
ition them as a trusted third party. They also have
unique knowledge of official statistical production
methods. Finally, they continue to have privileged
access to government data sources that provide
unique information and knowledge and have the
authority to collect data for statistical purposes that
because of privacy considerations will never be avail-
able to businesses.
As a consequence, in the context of the challenges of
Big Data sources, NSIs will remain important providers
of official statistics. And where other organisations are
able to provide statistical information to the public,
rather than competing, NSIs could build on their pos-
ition as an impartial, trusted third party and their
expertise to advise on the quality and validity of infor-
mation of these various sources. Possibly, then, pro-
viders of Big Data may even seek validation of their
data from NSIs, thereby opening up yet another possi-
bility for new partnerships.
The future of official statistics in the age of Big Data
is still a matter of some deliberation and experimenta-
tion. But what is clear already is that the international
statistical community needs to adapt to a new reality
and respond to the opportunities and challenges it pro-
vides. To do so calls for greater collaboration with
players inside and outside the statistical community,
through the formation of flexible networks that can
forge new ways of generating statistical data. For all
engaged with statistics, we think the Big Data era is a
most exciting time.
