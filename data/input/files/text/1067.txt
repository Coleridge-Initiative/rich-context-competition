and academic performance: national study of kindergartners
and first-graders. Obes Res. 2004;12:58­68.
Objective: To examine the association between children's
overweight status in kindergarten and their academic
achievement in kindergarten and first grade.
Research Methods and Procedures: The data analyzed
consisted of 11,192 first time kindergartners from the Early
Childhood Longitudinal Study, a nationally representative
sample of kindergartners in the U.S. in 1998. Multivariate
regression techniques were used to estimate the independent
association of overweight status with children's math and
reading standardized test scores in kindergarten and grade 1.
We controlled for socioeconomic status, parent-child inter-
action, birth weight, physical activity, and television watch-
ing.
Results: Overweight children had significantly lower math
and reading test scores compared with nonoverweight chil-
dren in kindergarten. Both groups were gaining similarly on
math and reading test scores, resulting in significantly lower
test scores among overweight children at the end of grade 1.
However, these differences, except for boys' math scores at
baseline (difference  1.22 points, p  0.001), became
insignificant after including socioeconomic and behavioral
variables, indicating that overweight is a marker but not a
causal factor. Race/ethnicity and mother's education were
stronger predictors of test score gains or levels than over-
weight status.
Discussion: Significant differences in test scores by over-
weight status at the beginning of kindergarten and the end of
grade 1 can be explained by other individual characteristics,
including parental education and the home environment.
However, overweight is more easily observable by other
students compared with socioeconomic characteristics, and
its significant (unadjusted) association with worse academic
performance can contribute to the stigma of overweight as
early as the first years of elementary school.

Introduction
Childhood obesity has become one of the most prominent
public health concerns in the U.S (1,2). Numerous studies
have documented the dramatic rise in obesity and over-
weight in both adults and children (3­7). According to
recent estimates, the prevalence of overweight (BMI  95th
percentile for age and gender) is 15.3% in 6- to 11-year-old
children and 10.4% among 2- to 5-year-old children, com-
pared with 11.3% and 7.2%, respectively, in 1988 to 1994
(4).
Childhood obesity has been shown to be associated with
several immediate health risk factors such as orthopedic,
neurological, pulmonary, gastroenterological, and endo-
crine conditions (8). Maybe even more importantly, obesity
also affects children's psychosocial outcomes, such as low
self-esteem and depression, resulting from overweight con-
cerns (9­17). These mechanisms may affect other aspects
of children's lives, such as academic performance (18­22),
with potentially even more serious adverse social outcomes
in the long term. Although it is well known that lower
educational achievement among adults is associated with
obesity, recent research has also reported that obese adoles-
cents consider themselves worse students (23). It is less
known whether these findings hold for younger children or
when objective measures of school performance are used.
To our knowledge, there are only two international studies
that have examined related issues. Li used data on primary

school children in China and found that severely obese
children had significantly lower IQ (intelligence quotient)
scores than the controls (24). However, IQ is a measure of
ability, and although it would be likely to affect school
performance, it is not an indicator of academic achievement.
Mo-suwan et al. examined the relationship between over-
weight status and academic performance in children from
grades 3 to 6 and 7 to 9 using data from Thailand (25). They
found that being overweight during adolescence (grades 7 to
9) was associated with poor school performance, whereas
such an association did not exist in children (grades 3 to 6).
This paper is the first study, to our knowledge, to exam-
ine the relationship between childhood overweight and ac-
ademic performance among younger children using data
from the U.S. We used a national probability sample of
kindergartners in the U.S. to examine whether overweight
status in kindergarten was associated with poor academic
performance during the first 2 years in school after control-
ling for socioeconomic characteristics and other potential
confounders.
Research Methods and Procedures
We analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal
Study-Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K).1 (For a description of
the ECLS-K, see http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/pdf/essaysmisc/
ksum.pdf.) The ECLS-K surveyed a nationally representa-
tive cohort of kindergartners in the U.S. during the 1998 to
1999 school year. The sample was selected using a multi-
stage cluster sampling design, where first schools were
selected, and subsequently children within schools were
selected. (For more information on the survey design and
instruments, see 26.) The study collected detailed informa-
tion on children and parent, teacher, and school character-
istics at multiple time points. Baseline data were collected in
fall of kindergarten (wave 1) followed by additional waves
in spring kindergarten (wave 2), fall grade 1 (wave 3), and
spring grade 1 (wave 4). We used data from waves 1, 2, and
4 for our analysis. (The fall grade 1 wave surveyed only a
30% subsample of baseline children; therefore, we did not
use this wave for our analysis.) The average time between
data collection in waves 1 and 4 was 18 months.
From the original sample of children assessed in fall
kindergarten, 5% dropped out of the sample by spring
kindergarten. An additional 17% dropped out between
spring kindergarten and spring first grade. Most of the
children lost to follow-up between kindergarten and first
grade were those who changed schools. The ECLS followed
up all movers from a random 50% of schools in the sample.
Therefore, most of the children lost to follow-up were those
randomly selected for no follow-up and would be unlikely
to bias the results. In addition, data on the parent question-
naire were available for only 80% of the original sample.
The nonresponse rates on the parent questionnaire tended to
be higher among nonwhites. Finally, we included only
children who were first time kindergartners. Our analysis
sample consisted of 11,192 children for whom math and
reading test scores were available for all the three waves and
BMI was available at baseline. Among children for whom
baseline data were available, there were no significant dif-
ferences between those for whom test scores were available
in later waves and those for whom test scores were not
available in later waves, except that the former were more
likely to be from high-income families.
The ECLS-K data are one of the first to collect informa-
tion on school performance and childhood overweight sta-
tus. An important feature of the ECLS-K is that it measured
children's height and weight at each data collection period,
instead of relying on parent reports of children's height and
weight. Self-reported height and weight are not very reli-
able, and, among adults, there is a well-known tendency
toward underreporting of weight and overreporting of
height (27­29). For children, whose height and weight
change rapidly, parent reports could introduce such high
measurement error that even large substantial effects could
be rendered statistically insignificant.
Dependent Variables
The dependent variables in our analysis were the child's
reading and math test scores in waves 1, 2, and 4. Children
surveyed in the ECLS-K were given individually adminis-
tered math and reading assessments at each data collection
point. In each subject area, assessments consisted of a
two-stage assessment. In the first stage, children received a
12- to 20-item routing test. Performance on the routing
items guided the selection of one of the several alternative
second stage tests. The second stage test contained items of
appropriate difficulty for the level of ability indicated by the
routing test. Because not all children took the exact same
test, item response theory (IRT) scale scores were computed
for all children. IRT scores represent estimates of the num-
ber of items students would have answered correctly if they
had taken all of the 92 questions in the first and second stage
reading forms and the 64 questions in all of the mathematics
forms. These scores are comparable across students within
a wave and also across waves enabling comparison of
children's performance over time. The reliability of test
scores was very high: 0.93 for reading and 0.92 for math.
(For detailed information on the tests administered, see 26.)
We used standardized IRT scale scores in reading and
mathematics to measure children's cognitive skills. These
scores are an indicator of the child's performance relative to
his or her peers. The standardized scores were rescaled to a
mean of 50 and SD of 10. Therefore, a standardized score of
55 on the reading test represents a reading achievement

level that is one-half of an SD higher than the mean for fall
kindergarten population represented by the tested sample of
ECLS-K participants.
Explanatory Variables
The key explanatory variable was an indicator variable
for the child's overweight status at baseline. We used the
Centers for Disease Control-recommended definitions of
overweight in children to construct our overweight measure
(30­32). Children who had a BMI  95th percentile for
their age and gender were classified as overweight. The
ECLS collected children's height and weight measurements
in each wave, and these were used to compute the BMI. The
height and weight measurements were recorded by the
assessor using the Shorr Board and a digital bathroom scale,
respectively. All children were measured twice to minimize
measurement error. If the two height values from the in-
strument were 2 inches apart, the average of the two
height values was computed and used as the composite
measure of height. Otherwise, the value that was closest to
43 inches (the average height for a 5-year-old child) was
used as the composite. For the weight composite, if the two
weight values from the instrument were 5 pounds apart,
the average of the two values was computed. Otherwise, the
value that was closest to 40 pounds (the average weight for
a 5-year-old child) was used as the composite value. A
composite BMI was calculated using the composite height
and weight values and was multiplied by the appropriate
factor to convert into kilograms per meter squared.
We used multivariate regression to control for socioeco-
nomic factors and other potentially confounding factors that
may be correlated with both childhood overweight and
academic performance. There is some evidence that televi-
sion watching among children is associated with greater
likelihood of childhood overweight (33­36). We included a
parent-reported measure of child's television watching--
number of hours that the child watched television or videos
on a typical school day. (Typically, the respondent for
parent interviews was the child's mother. If the mother was
not available, then the next selected respondent was another
parent or guardian followed by another household member.)
In addition, children's physical activity has also been linked
to childhood overweight (36­38). More active children are
less likely to be overweight. We included in our regressions
the parent-reported physical activity of the child measured
by the number of days in a week the child got exercise that
caused rapid breathing, perspiration, and a rapid heart beat
for 20 minutes or more. In addition, we included a variable
that captured the level of parent-child interaction. The
ECLS asked parents how often they participated in certain
activities with their child, such as reading books to children,
telling stories, playing sports, and singing songs. Our mea-
sure of parent-child interaction was defined as the number
of activities that the parent participated in with the child at
least once a week. Finally, we included the child's birth
weight because there is evidence that low birth weight is
associated with poor academic performance and may also
be related to overweight status (39­41). Other explanatory
variables in our analysis included race/ethnicity (white,
black, Hispanic, Asian, others), mother's education [less
than high school (HS) diploma, HS diploma, some college,
bachelor's degree, and more than a bachelor's degree],
annual family income, and urbanicity.
We present separate analyses for boys and girls. First, we
obtained cross-sectional estimates of the effect of over-
weight status using only the fall kindergarten data. Next, we
conducted a longitudinal regression analysis where we es-
timated the effect of overweight status on test scores in later
waves, controlling for baseline test scores on entry into
kindergarten, sociodemographic factors, and potential con-
founders. This model is identical to one where change
scores are regressed on baseline test scores. Controlling for
baseline test scores would partial out effects of other factors
that determine school readiness and would allow us to
examine the independent effect of obesity on academic
achievement as a result of being in school. We also ran
interaction models to examine whether the association be-
tween overweight status and test scores varied by race/
ethnicity. Because of the clustered sample design, we ad-
justed the SEs of the regression using the Huber/White
correction as implemented in the cluster option in Stata 7.0
(Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
Results
The ECLS-K data show that about 1 in 10 kindergartners
(11.1%) was overweight when he or she entered kindergar-
ten in 1998. The prevalence of overweight was slightly
higher in boys (12%) than girls (10.2%) (p  0.003). Table
1 presents descriptive statistics for boys and girls separately,
by overweight status. Overweight children were signifi-
cantly more likely (p  0.05) to be Hispanic and poor, and
had less educated mothers compared with nonoverweight
children. Overweight boys and girls also had significantly
higher (p  0.05) birth weight and watched more hours of
television or videos per day compared with nonoverweight
children. Boys living in suburban areas were less likely to
be overweight (p  0.05), whereas boys living in small
towns or rural areas were more likely to be overweight (p 
0.05).
The simple bivariate estimates from Table 1 show that
overweight boys scored 1.42 points lower (p  0.05) in
reading than nonoverweight boys at the beginning of kin-
dergarten, with a similar difference among girls (1.66
points, p  0.05). In math, the test score difference between
overweight and nonoverweight boys was greater (1.99
points, p  0.05), but it was lower among girls (1.21 points,
p  0.05).

significantly from nonoverweight girls in either reading
(p  0.064) or math (p  0.355). It is not surprising that the
association between overweight status and academic perfor-
mance weakened when we controlled for socioeconomic
differences. In our study, children with family income
greater than $75,000 and mothers with more than a bache-
lor's degree were significantly less likely (p  0.05) to be
overweight and also had significantly higher test scores
(p  0.05). Therefore, not controlling for socioeconomic
status overestimated the association between overweight
status and test scores. However, there may still exist other
unobserved differences between overweight and nonover-
weight children that may influence their academic perfor-
mance when they enter kindergarten. As a result, cross-
sectional estimates may still suffer from bias.
The longitudinal regression estimates are presented in
Table 4 for boys and Table 5 for girls. Among boys, we
found that after controlling for baseline test scores, over-
weight status did not have a significant effect on math
scores in two subsequent waves. In reading, overweight
boys scored 0.61 points lower at the end of kindergarten
(p  0.017). However, this difference became statistically
insignificant at the end of first grade (p  0.142). Among
girls, overweight status did not have a statistically signifi-
cant effect on either math or reading scores in subsequent
waves after controlling for baseline test scores. Figures 1

and 2 show the estimated test score differences at the end of
kindergarten and first grade between overweight and non-
overweight children for boys and girls, respectively.
These estimates were computed assuming no baseline
test score differences between overweight and nonover-
weight children. The "adjusted" scores are based on the
estimates from the longitudinal models, whereas the "un-
adjusted" scores capture the raw mean scores for the
overweight children. The figures emphasize the impor-
tance of sociodemographic factors and other controls in
the models in explaining the test score differentials be-
tween overweight and nonoverweight children. In fact, in
all cases, the score differential by overweight status was
completely explained by these factors.
We also examined whether the association between over-
weight status and test scores varied by race/ethnicity by
including interactions between overweight status and race/
ethnicity in the previous regressions (data not shown). We
did not find any statistically significant differences by race/
ethnicity in the effect of overweight on test scores. How-
ever, the main effects of race/ethnicity on test scores in later
waves, controlling for baseline scores, remained large and
statistically significant.
Other variables included in the models had much stronger
effects on children's academic performance compared with
overweight status (Tables 4 and 5). Mother's education was
a stronger predictor of test scores compared with over-
weight status in boys and girls. For example, boys with

mothers who had less than HS education scored 1.16 points
and 2.07 points lower on reading tests at the end of kinder-
garten and first grade, respectively, compared with boys
with mothers who had some college education. This finding
held for both math and reading scores for boys and girls.
Race/ethnicity also had a much stronger effect on test scores
compared with overweight status. Specifically, blacks
scored significantly lower over time compared with whites

video watched per day was also an important predictor of
test scores in later waves. For example, boys who watched

Discussion
This paper provides new evidence on the relationship
between childhood overweight and academic performance
using a nationally representative data set of kindergartners
in the U.S. Simple comparisons of mean test scores in
reading and math by overweight status indicate that there is

Childhood Overweight and Academic Performance, Datar, Sturm, and Magnabosco

a statistically significant association between childhood
overweight and test scores--overweight kindergartners
scored lower than their nonoverweight peers on standard-
ized tests. Controlling for socioeconomic differences and
other potential confounding factors weakened the associa-
tion between overweight and test scores at baseline among
boys and girls, although it remained statistically significant
for boys' math test scores. Our controls were more com-
prehensive than prior studies because the ECLS-K also
measured behavioral factors that may be associated with
both overweight status and poorer academic performance,
such as a cognitively stimulating home environment (42),
exercise (36­38), and television watching (33­35). In fact,
it might even be argued that we overcontrolled for some
factors, especially physical activity and television watching,
for which obesity may be as much a cause as a consequence.
Even with a rich set of controls, a cross-sectional analysis
may not control for unobserved differences between over-
weight and nonoverweight children that affect their test
scores. For example, lifestyle and quality of home environ-
ment are hard to observe and may not be fully captured by
the measures included in our study. Moreover, a cross-
sectional analysis does not help in establishing the direc-
tionality of the effect. Lower test scores may cause over-
weight among children just as overweight status may lead to
lower test scores.
The ECLS-K data allowed us to examine the relationship
between childhood overweight and test scores longitudi-
nally. Our longitudinal approach tried to control for some of
these unobserved differences that may exist between over-
weight and nonoverweight children by controlling for chil-
dren's baseline test scores. By doing so, this approach
placed all children at the same achievement level at baseline
and examined whether future test scores were related to
baseline overweight status.
The results from our longitudinal approach are identical
to a model where gain scores are regressed on baseline

scores. Our findings suggest that after controlling for socio-
economic characteristics, there was no statistically signifi-
cant difference in test score gains during the first 2 years in
school between overweight and nonoverweight children. As
a result, the baseline test score gap that existed between
overweight and nonoverweight children persisted even at
the end of first grade. We found no differences by race/
ethnicity in the relationship between overweight and test
scores.
The effect sizes associated with overweight among boys
were between SDs of 0.06 and 0.12. These estimates sug-
gest that overweight in boys may be a greater risk factor for
academic performance than other childhood health risks,
such as food insufficiency, diabetes, or asthma. Studies that
have examined the relationship between academic perfor-
mance and other childhood health risks have tended to find
effect sizes that are lower than those found in this paper.
Alaimo et al. found that food insufficiency among 6- to
11-year-old children is associated with a 0.02 and 0.07 SD
decrease in reading and math standardized test scores, re-
spectively (43). The effect of diabetes on children's cogni-
tive skills has been shown to be insignificant (44). Even
asthma, which is known to be a major cause of morbidity in
childhood, has been found to have no significant association
with children's academic performance (45­48). However,
some other socioeconomic factors, especially mother's ed-
ucation and race/ethnicity, seem to have a far stronger
association with test scores than overweight status.
It is also important to bear in mind that small or insig-
nificant associations between overweight status and aca-
demic performance do not necessarily imply that over-
weight is not important for academic performance, because
the effects of overweight may appear with a time lag. For
example, Erickson et al. showed that overweight in adoles-
cent girls is significantly associated with negative psycho-
logical outcomes, which may, in turn, affect their academic
performance (9). Although we found no differences by
overweight status in test score gains, we observed only the
first 2 years of schooling. Future waves of the ECLS-K data
will allow the examination of whether these relationships
become important as children grow older.
In summary, we found a significant test score gap in math
and reading between overweight vs. nonoverweight chil-
dren at baseline and, because both groups gain similarly
over time, at follow-up. However, these differences, except
for boys' math scores at baseline, became insignificant after
including socioeconomic and behavioral variables. These
findings indicate that overweight is a marker, but not a
causal factor, affecting academic performance. In addition,
race/ethnicity and mother's education are stronger predic-
tors of test score gains or levels than overweight status.
However, even though the significant differences in test
scores by overweight status can be explained with other
individual characteristics, especially parental education and
the home environment, overweight is more easily observ-
able by students compared with other socioeconomic
characteristics, and its significant (unadjusted) association
with worse academic performance can contribute to the
stigma of overweight as early as the first years of elemen-
tary school.
