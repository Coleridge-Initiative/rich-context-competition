Evidence Links Increases In Public
Health Spending To Declines In
Preventable Deaths
ABSTRACT Public health encompasses a broad array of programs designed
to prevent the occurrence of disease and injury within communities. But
policy makers have little evidence to draw on when determining the value
of investments in these program activities, which currently account for
less than 5 percent of US health spending. We examine whether changes
in spending by local public health agencies over a thirteen-year period
contributed to changes in rates of community mortality from preventable
causes of death, including infant mortality and deaths due to
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. We found that mortality
rates fell between 1.1 percent and 6.9 percent for each 10 percent increase
in local public health spending. These results suggest that increased
public health investments can produce measurable improvements in
health, especially in low-resource communities. However, more money by
itself is unlikely to generate significant and sustainable health gains;
improvements in public health practices are needed as well.
Despite devoting far more resourc-
es to health than any other coun-
try in the world, the United States
continues to lag behind many
other industrialized nations in
health outcomes, including morbidity and mor-
tality.1 Although there are many factors that con-
tribute to this gap between resources and out-
comes, one possible contributor is the relatively
limited investment in public health activities
that are designed to promote health and prevent
disease and disability.2­5 These activities include
efforts to monitor community health status; in-
vestigate and control disease outbreaks; educate
the public about health risks and prevention
strategies; enforce public health laws and regu-
lations such as those concerning tobacco use;
and inspect and ensure the safety and quality
of water, food, air, and other resources necessary
for health.6
Although national data on public health
spending are scarce and imperfect, estimates
consistently indicate that less than 5 percent
of national health spending is devoted to public
health activities.7­9 In fact, the United States
spends more on administrative overhead for
medical care and health insurance than it does
on public health activities.10
The resources invested in public health strat-
egies within the United States vary widely across
states and communities, yet the effects of this
variation on population health remain poorly
understood. Consequently, public health offi-
cials and policy makers face considerable uncer-
tainty regarding the appropriate levels and tar-
gets of investing in public health activities.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 authorized the
largest expansion in federal public health spend-
ing in decades--a projected $15 billion in new
spending over ten years--with the goals of im-
proving population health, reducing health dis-
parities, and helping to "bend the cost curve" by
moderating growth in medical care spending.
However, uncertainties regarding the expected

effect and value of these public health invest-
ments have contributed to the political contro-
versy surrounding the Affordable Care Act.11,12
Meanwhile, a persistent economic downturn
has precipitated large cuts in state and local
government support for public health activities,
which has raised concerns about future adverse
consequences for population health.
To shed light on these uncertainties, this study
uses measures of public health spending from
local public health agencies over a thirteen-year
period to estimate the effects of this spending on
preventable mortality rates.
Background
Public health activities in the United States are
supported through a patchwork of funding
sources and financing arrangements that vary
widely across states and communities and that
are relatively unstable over time.13,14 These ar-
rangements result in large geographic differen-
ces in spending for public health activities, even
among communities with relatively similar pop-
ulation characteristics and health needs.15
At the state level, per capita public health
spending varied by a factor of more than thirty
in 2010, ranging from a low of less than $4 in
Nevada to a high of more than $171 in Hawaii.9
Local variation in public health spending was
even larger, ranging from less than $1 per capita
to more than $200 per capita in 2008; among
local public health agencies the median spent
was about $36 per person.16 Many communities
depend heavily on local tax bases to support
public health programs, making it difficult for
economically disadvantaged communities to
support a comprehensive array of activities.17
Because only 16 percent of funding for public
health activities is derived from the federal
government,7 federal spending is insufficient
to equalize large differences in funding--from
taxes--of public health programs across lo-
calities.18
The amount of resources expended on public
health activities in a given community is deter-
mined through a complex interaction of eco-
nomic conditions and fiscal capacities, commu-
nity health needs, policy priorities, and delivery
system characteristics.15 Community-level varia-
tion in public health spending may result from
differences in the mix of activities produced; dif-
ferences in the volume, intensity, and quality of
activities produced; and differences in the pro-
duction and delivery costs incurred.
Higher levels of spending may contribute to
improved population health if resources are al-
located to activities that are effective in reducing
health risks, and if these activities are targeted
successfully to population groups at risk. How-
ever, communities may vary considerably in how
effectively and efficiently resources are used to
address community health needs, thereby weak-
ening the effect of spending on population
health. Research has documented such discon-
nects between spending and outcomes in local
medical care delivery.19
On balance, there is very little empirical evi-
dence about the extent to which differences in
public health spending levels contribute to dif-
ferences in population health.20 Several cross-
national studies have found weak and conflicting
associations between spending and health out-
comes at a national level.21­23 In the United
States, several time-series studies have examined
associations between spending levels and health
outcomes for specific types of programs such as
those targeting HIV prevention, sexually trans-
mitted disease prevention, and tobacco control,
finding that disease incidence and/or harmful
behaviors declined as expected in response to
funding increases.24­28
However, very little attention has been paid to
the value of investments in the public health
system as a whole, leading to persistent ques-
tions about whether the nation's current spend-
ing levels are worth the opportunity costs. Better
evidence about the consequences of these spend-
ing patterns is likely to help policy makers at all
levels of government make informed decisions
about how to allocate scarce health resources.
To this end, we assembled a unique longitudi-
nal database that included local government
public health spending, population characteris-
tics, and community mortality rates, in order to
estimate how changes in public health spending
influence population health.We used the consid-
erable natural variation in public health spend-
ing levels across communities, and the consid-
erable change in these levels over time, to
estimate health effects.
This study focuses on spending and health at
the local level because local public health agen-
cies--rather than their state and federal counter-
parts--assume primary responsibility for di-
rectly implementing public health activities in
most communities.29 Most federal and state
funding--and large amounts of private philan-
thropic funding--for public health activities is
channeled through local public health agencies.
The local agencies also mobilize and coordinate
the public health activities of hospitals, health
plans, and community-based organizations.30
Thus, these agencies provide valuable settings
in which to study the health consequences of
public health spending in the United States.

Study Data And Methods
We analyzed changes in spending patterns and
mortality rates within the service areas of the
nation's nearly three thousand local public
health agencies over a thirteen-year period.
The study population included all organizations
that met the National Association of County and
City Health Officials' definition of a local health
department: a unit of a local or state government
that has responsibility for performing public
health functions for a geopolitical jurisdiction
smaller than a state.16 In 2005 approximately
73 percent of these agencies served county juris-
dictions or combined city and county jurisdic-
tions, and the remaining agencies served city
or township jurisdictions (16 percent), or multi-
county or regional jurisdictions (11 percent).
Data Sources And Measures The National
Association of County and City Health Officials
collected spending data along with organiza-
tional and operational characteristics of local
public health agencies through census surveys
conducted in 1993, 1997, and 2005. Key variables
reflecting annual agency spending, service offer-
ings, and staffing levels were collected in each
year of the survey.We linked the survey data with
contemporaneous county-level data on popula-
tion characteristics and health resources from
the Health Resources and Services Administra-
tion's Area Resource File (a national county-level
health resource information database), federal
and state spending estimates from the Census
Bureau's Consolidated Federal Funds Report and
Census of Governments, and cause-specific mor-
tality rates from the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Compressed Mortality File.
As outcome measures, we used mortality rates
that were expected to be sensitive to public
health interventions over the thirteen-year
period of study,31,32 including the age-adjusted
all-cause mortality rate, the infant mortality rate,
and the age-adjusted mortality rates for heart
disease, cancer, diabetes, and influenza. Two
additional mortality measures were selected as
control conditions based on the expectation that
they would not be influenced by public health
resources and interventions during the study
period. These measures included mortality from
Alzheimer's disease and a measure of residual
mortality indicating deaths not attributable to
heart disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonarydisease, influenza, cerebrovascu-
lar diseases, or unintentional injuries.
The primary independent variable of interest
in this analysis is the measure of per capita local
public health spending, defined as the total an-
nual spending of the local public health agency,
divided by the total population residing within
the jurisdiction of the agency. We also con-
structed measures of direct state and federal pub-
lic health spending that were not passed through
to local public health agencies. Other measures
reflecting community demographic and socio-
economic characteristics and area health re-
sources are used as control variables in the analy-
sis (Exhibit 1).
Analytic Methods Multivariate regression
models for panel data were used to estimate
the effect of local public health spending on each
mortality measure while controlling for the ef-
fects of other community characteristics that in-
fluence population health. Time-trend variables
were used in the models to account for general
downward trends in mortality that occurred
independently of spending.
An important methodological complication
arises in this analysis because local public health
spending levels may be influenced by unob-
served community characteristics that simulta-
neously influence mortality. For example,
deteriorating local economic conditions may
cause public health spending to decline and mor-
tality risks to rise, resulting in incorrect infer-
ences about how spending influences mortality.
To address this possible source of bias, we used
instrumental variables methods to distinguish
the effects of spending on mortality from the
effects of unmeasured characteristics that simul-
taneously influence spending and mortality.33,34
This methodology requires the identification of
variables that influence local public health
spending but have no direct effects on commu-
nity mortality rates. We used measures of local
public health decision-making structures for this
purpose, including whether the agency is gov-
erned by a local board of health with policy mak-
ing authority, and whether the agency operates
under the centralized administrative control of
state government. Theory and previous studies
indicate that these characteristics influence the
ability and inclination of local public health
agencies to secure external funding sources for
their work.15,35­37
Specification tests38 confirm that the struc-
tural characteristics meet the requirements for
instrumental variables (see the Appendix).39 Us-
ing a two-step process, we first estimated the
effect of the instrumental variables on spending
levels, and then used the natural variation in
spending produced by these variables to esti-
mate how spending affects mortality.
Limitations Several limitations of this analy-
sis are worthy of emphasis. Although we used
strong statistical controls to address possible
sources of bias,34,35 it remains possible that fac-
tors distinct from, but closely correlated with,
public health spending may explain some of
the observed associations between spending

and mortality. In addition, our analysis focused
on selected mortality rates as measures of pop-
ulation health, not on other indicators of disease
burden or quality of life.
Local public health activities may have impor-
tant and perhaps more immediate effects on
these other indicators of health. Moreover, the
thirteen-year time period used in this study is
insufficient for observing the complete, long-
term effects of public health interventions on
chronic disease mortality rates. Consequently,
this analysis may underestimate the health con-
sequences of changes in local public health
spending.
Study Results
Variation In Spending And Mortality A gen-
eral secular trend of growth in public health
spending and reductions in selected mortality
rates during the 1993­2005 period masked sig-
nificant community-level differences. Local pub-
lic health spending in the average community
reached $40.84 per capita in 2005, up from
$34.68 per capita in 1993 (Exhibit 1). However,
only 65 percent of agencies experienced positive
growth in per capita public health spending dur-
ing the 1993­2005 period, while 35 percent of
agencies experienced spending reductions.
The degree of change in per capita spending
varied widely across communities. The top
20 percent of agencies experienced growth of
nearly 150 percent, while the bottom 20 percent
of agencies experienced reductions of nearly
45 percent during the study period. Meanwhile,
infant mortality and heart disease mortality rates
declined moderately during the same period,
continuing a longer-term secular trend down-
ward, while cancer and diabetes mortality rose
slightly (Exhibit 1).
The rates of change in these outcomes varied
widely among communities. For example, the
top 20 percent of communities experienced a
reduction in age-adjusted heart disease mortality

of 104 deaths per 100,000 people, while the bot-
tom 20 percent of communities saw mortality
increase by forty-three deaths per 100,000 peo-
ple. Overall, population size, educational attain-
ment, physician availability, and number of peo-
ple above the federal poverty level increased in
the average community during this period.
Determinants Of Public Health Spending
Local decision-making structures influenced
public health spending levels considerably. Per
capita spending was more than 17 percent higher
in communities governed by a local board of
health, compared to communities without such
boards (p < 0:001) (Exhibit 2). Moreover,
spending was 24 percent lower among agencies
that operated under the centralized administra-
tive control of state agencies, as compared to
independent local agencies.
Public health spending increased with social
indicators of community health need, including
the unemployment rate, the uninsured rate, and
the nonwhite racial composition of the commu-
nity, whereas spending decreased with the avail-
ability of selected medical resources in the com-
munity (Exhibit 2).
Effects Of Spending On Mortality In-
creases in public health spending were associ-
ated with statistically significant reductions in
mortality for four of the six mortality rates we
examined (Exhibit 3). The strongest effects were
found for infant mortality and cardiovascular
disease mortality, indicating that mortality rates
fellby6.9percentand3.2percentforeach10 per-
cent increase in spending (p < 0:05). Diabetes
mortality fell by 1.4 percent and cancer mortality
fell by 1.1 percent for each 10 percent increase in
spending (p < 0:05).
Influenza mortality and total mortality
changed in the expected direction, but did not
reach statistical significance. Public health
spending showed no association with the two
control conditions, Alzheimer's mortality and
residual mortality, helping us to rule out the
possibility of spurious associations between
spending and mortality.
Overall, public health spending emerged as
one of the most consistent determinants of com-
munity-level preventable mortality. Most of the
other variables that were consistently associated
with reductions in mortality reflected social de-
terminants of health, including educational at-
tainment, percentage of the population above
the federal poverty level, and percentage of the
population that was white (see the Appendix).39
Medical resource variables were not consistently
associated with mortality after controlling for
the effects of other variables in the analysis.

Communities with larger increases in public
health spending experienced larger reductions

in mortality from leading preventable causes of
death over a thirteen-year period. This relation-
ship was consistent across several different
mortality measures, and it persisted after ac-
counting for differences in demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics, medical resour-
ces, and unobserved community characteristics
that jointly influence spending and health. These
findings are consistent with recent time-series
studies estimating that, nationally, as much as
50 percent of the gains in life expectancy expe-
rienced in the United States since 1950 are attrib-
utable to public health attention to diet, tobacco
exposure, and other measures.40­44
Although our study does not establish a defini-
tive causal link between spending and mortality
because of the observational research design we
used, it nevertheless provides compelling evi-
dence that differences in public health invest-
ments may contribute to differences in commu-
nity health outcomes. Consequently, efforts to
improve community health and reduce geo-
graphic disparities in mortality are likely to re-
quire attention not only to local medical resourc-
es and interventions, but also to the resources
invested in local public health activities.
The findings imply that the mortality reduc-
tions attributable to increases in public health
spending are sizable, and may exceed the reduc-
tions achievable through similar expansions in
local medical care resources. For example, our
estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in
public health spending could achieve a 3.2 per-
cent reduction in cardiovascular mortality. This
spending increase would require an additional
$312,274 in annual funding in the average met-
ropolitan community included in our analysis.
Achieving this same mortality reduction by
increasing the number of primary care physi-
cians would require an additional twenty-seven
physicians in the average metropolitan commu-
nity, based on a recent analysis of physician sup-
ply.45 Increasing the physician supply by this
amount would probably require new spending
considerably in excess of the amount needed to
achieve the mortality reduction through public
health spending. The potential for substitution
and synergy between public health and medical
care resources is an important area for fur-
ther study.
The strongest associations between spending
and mortality were observed for infant mortality,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer--
four of the preventable health conditions most
commonly targeted by public health agencies. In
2005, 73 percent of the nation's local health de-
partments maintained screening and/or risk-
reduction programs for cardiovascular disease
or high blood pressure, 74 percent delivered ma-
ternal and infant health programs involving nu-
trition and/or prenatal care, and 69 percent
performed activities to reduce tobacco expo-
sure--a risk factor for all four causes of death.16
Evidence-based public health interventions
areknown to address risk factors for thesecauses
of death.46­48 The observed associations between
spending and mortality are consistent with the
expectation that higher levels of spending allow
public health agencies to implement these types
of risk-reduction activities more effectively
within their communities.
Influenza mortality and total mortality did not
appear sensitive to public health spending in our
analysis. A combination of factors may explain

the influenza result, including the dearth of
effective community-based interventions for
achieving high vaccination rates, random varia-
tion in influenza lethality, and inconsistencies in
how deaths are attributed to influenza.49 For to-
tal mortality, the lack of a significant spending
effect probably stems from the heterogeneous
disease processes reflected in this broad mortal-
ity measure and the many factors beyond public
health interventions that influence these
processes.
Our results suggest that additional spending,
such as the $15 billion in new federal funds au-
thorized under the Affordable Care Act's Preven-
tion and Public Health Fund, would be expected
to generate substantial improvements in popu-
lation health over time. At the same time, our
results suggest that the recent recession-driven
reductions in state and local support for public
health activities are likely to have adverse health
consequences over time unless they are offset
with new spending. Additional research is ur-
gently needed to track the downstream effects
of these ongoing, unprecedented spending
shocks in public health. Our study provides a
foundation for these future investigations.
The mortality reductions attributable to public
health spending in this study represent average
effects across all US local public health agencies
and across all categories of local governmental
public health spending. Unfortunately, because
our analysis of spending was carried out at an
aggregate level, our results do not suggest how
future funding increases and reductions should
be allocated among the many programs and ser-
vices maintained at the local level.
The aggregate nature of our analysis may also
explain the relatively modest mortality effects we
observed. By measuring spending levels in spe-
cific programmatic areas such as tobacco con-
trol, nutrition, and physical activity, it may be
possible to identify more precise relationships
between investments and health outcomes and
to examine the comparative effectiveness of each
type of spending. Such targeted studies will re-
quire much more detailedspendingdata than are
currently available for local public health agen-
cies nationwide, which calls attention to the
need for improved data systems to track public
health spending.
Our analysis supports the contention that
spending on local public health activities is a
wise health investment. Increasing such invest-
ments in communities with historically low lev-
els of spending may provide an effective way of
reducing geographic disparities in population
health. However, more money by itself is
unlikely to generate significant and sustainable
health gains.
A growing body of evidence suggests that the
quality and efficiency of public health practice
within the United States have considerable room
for improvement, and progress in these areas
could greatly increase the value of additional
public health spending.35,50­54 Better systems
for tracking data on trends in public health
spending and the use of funds at local, state,
and national levels are needed to ensure that
resources are allocated wisely. Moreover, the re-
sulting estimates of spending and their health
consequences must be accessible to public health
officials, policy makers, and the public at large to
support informed decision making about soci-
etal investments in public health activities.
