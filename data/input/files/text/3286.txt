Abstract
Objective: This study evaluated associations of basal serum and follicular fluid (FF) anti-Muu
¨llerian
hormone (AMH) levels with in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) patients.
Methods: This prospective study included 179 consecutive women undergoing IVF, including 59 with
PCOS and non-PCOS controls. Thirty PCOS cases had long gona-dotrophin-releasing hormone
agonist (GnRH-a) and 29 had antagonist (GnRH-ant) protocols. Controls underwent conventional
GnRH-a. Associations of basal serum and FF AMH levels with IVF outcomes were assessed.
Results: Median serum and FF AMH levels, antral follicle count (AFC), oestradiol human chorionic
gonadotropin injection day (peak E2), and retrieved oocyte numbers were higher in PCOS patients
than in controls (all P < 0.01). Oocyte maturation and high-quality embryo rates were lower in
PCOS patients than in controls (P < 0.01), but both groups had similar fertilization, implantation,
clinical pregnancy, and newborn rates. Peak E2 was higher in GnRH-ant than in GnRH-a protocols
(16.5 nmol/L vs. 12.1 nmol/L, P < 0.05). AMH levels were correlated with AFC in PCOS patients
(P < 0.01). Peak E2 and FF AMH levels were independent predictors of oocyte number. Peak E2
predicted the fertilization rate.
Conclusion: Serum basal AMH levels are predictive of oocyte quantity, but not oocyte quality or
IVF outcomes. Serum AMH, FF AMH, and outcomes are similar among protocols.

Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the
most common endocrine disorder causing
ovulation failure in women of reproductive
age. PCOS has an incidence ranging from
8.7% to 17.8%, depending upon the criteria
used.1­4 PCOS is characterized by an exces-
sive number of growing ovarian follicles
of up to 2 to 5 mm in size.5 When in vitro
fertilization (IVF) is considered, PCOS is
a well-known risk factor for development
of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
(OHSS).6 Therefore, carefully monitoring
for OHSS during controlled ovarian hyper-
stimulation (COH) is important.7
Anti-Muu
¨ llerian hormone (AMH) is a
dimeric glycoprotein of the transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-b) family. AMH is
produced in the ovary by granulosa cells of
pre-antral and small antral follicles of less
than 4 mm diameter. Similar to established
predictors, such as maternal age, basal serum
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels,
and antral follicle count (AFC),8,9 AMH is
considered a useful marker of ovarian
reserve, and even clinical outcome of
IVF.10­14 However, a recent meta-analysis
suggested that there were weak associations
between AMH and implantation and clinical
pregnancy rates, while in women with dimin-
ished ovarian reserve, AMH had a poor
predictive ability of IVF outcome.15 The
main advantage of measurement of AMH
levels in IVF may stem from their low inter-
and intra-cycle variability. Therefore, AMH
levels could be used as a menstrual cycle-
independent marker of ovarian response to
COH.16 AMH is superior to age and FSH
levels for estimation of ovarian reserve and
adjusting the stimulation protocol in infertile
women. However, the value of AMH
levels for predicting pregnancy outcomes is
still uncertain.13,14
AMH levels in women with PCOS are
two- to three-fold higher than those
obtained in patients without PCOS.17
However, whether AMH levels in women
with PCOS provide useful information on
IVF outcomes is controversial because they
may not be an accurate predictor of out-
come in these patients.18,19 This study aimed
to evaluate whether basal and follicular fluid
(FF) AMH levels affect IVF outcome in
patients with PCOS. Our data suggest that
serum basal AMH levels are a significant
predictor of oocyte quantity, but not oocyte
quality or IVF outcomes.
Methods
Subjects and study design
This prospective, observational study
involved 179 consecutive patients who were
referred to the Reproductive Center
Department of the First Hospital of
Wenzhou Medical University, China, from
January 2012 to January 2014. The inclusion
criteria were patients with PCOS, fallopian
tube problems without PCOS, or treatment
due to male infertility without PCOS.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: >38
years, serum FSH levels >12IU/L, a history
of ovarian surgery, ovarian cyst or tumour,
hydrosalpinx, endometriosis, and endocrine
or systemic illnesses. In case of a positive
Chlamydia test, women received routine
antibiotics treatment. IVF was performed
once the test became negative.
There was some difference in protocols
among the women who were included in this
study because we found that women with
Chen et al. 1139
PCOS who were treated with the agonist
protocol were at high risk of OHSS.
Therefore, women with PCOS treated after-
wards received the antagonist protocol.
Consequently, 59 women with PCOS were
randomly assigned to two groups according
to their admission time There were 30 and 29
cases in the agonist and antagonist treat-
ment groups, respectively. A total of 120
non-PCOS patients with regular menstrual
cycles were assigned to the control group
and underwent a conventional long agonist
protocol. PCOS was diagnosed according to
the revised Rotterdam criteria.20
The study was approved by the hospital's
Ethics Committee (Approval ID: [2013] 27).
The protocol was explained to the patients
before enrolment, and informed consent was
obtained from each couple.
Protocol
Women with PCOS in the agonist group were
initiated with an oral contraceptive pill con-
taining ethinyloestradiol and cyproterone
acetate (Diane-35; Schering AG, Berlin,
Germany) on cycle days 3­5 for 14 days.
This treatment was performed to synchronize
their cycle and subsequent follicle
development. This was followed by pituitary
downregulation via administration of a gona-
dotrophin-releasing hormone agonist
(GnRH-a) consisting of 0.4 to 0.8mg of
triptorelin acetate (Decapeptyl; Ipsen
Pharmaceuticals,France).After14days,ovar-
ian stimulation was started with recombinant
FSH (Gonal-F; Merck Serono, Switzerland)
injection. Women with PCOS in the antagon-
ist group were pretreated with Diane-35 for 21
days and received Gonal-F injection on days
3­5 of the subsequent cycle. A total of 0.25mg
of cetrorelix (Cetrotide; Merck Serono,
Switzerland) was administered subcutane-
ously daily from the moment the leading
follicle reached 14mm in diameter until
human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) injec-
tion.Infertilewomeninthecontrolgroupwere
provided GnRH-a (triptorelin acetate) in the
mid-luteal phase (day 21) of the cycle at the
same dosage as that used for patients with
PCOS in the agonist group. Gonal-F was
administrated after downregulation of
the pituitary. The patients were provided
5000­10,000 IU of hCG when the leading
follicle reached 18 mm in diameter with at
least three follicles >16mm in diameter. The
oocytes were collected 36 h after hCG admin-
istration. AfterIVForintracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI), embryos with equally or
slightly unequally sized blastomeres and
<20% anucleate fragments were regarded as
good-quality embryos. Two or three good-
quality embryos were transferred 3 days after
collection of oocytes. Luteal support was
provided by injecting 60mg of progesterone
once daily and 10mg of dydrogesterone twice
daily from the day of retrieval of oocytes.
When oestradiol levels were greater than
15,000 pmol/L on the day of hCG injection,
or more than 15 oocytes were retrieved, the
risk of OHSS was explained to the patients. A
suggestion was then made to freeze the
embryos. In these cases, the women received
frozen thawed embryo transfer (FET) at a
later date.
Collection of specimens
A total of 5 ml of venous blood was collected
during a natural cycle on days 2­5, 1 week
before starting the IVF procedure. The
women with PCOS who were included in
this study all had menstrual cycles for this
measurement. FF was obtained from only
the first and largest follicle (>16 mm) to
avoid bleeding in the specimen. Blood and
FF samples were allowed to clot in collec-
tion tubes for 30­60 min, and were centri-
fuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting
supernatants were stored at À80C until use.
Serum AMH (defined as bAMH) and FF
AMH levels were determined by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent sensitive assays
according to the manufacturer's instructions
1140 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
(DSL, Webster, TX, USA). Hormone moni-
toring, including estradiol (E2) and b-hCG
concentrations, was performed by chemilu-
minescence methods (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Fullerton, USA).
The AFC was determined at days 2­5 of
the natural menstrual period. Follicles from
bilateral ovaries with diameters between 4
and 6 mm were counted by ultrasound
imaging. Serum E2 levels on the day of
hCG injection were defined as peak E2. The
oocyte maturity rate was calculated as the
ratio of oocytes at metaphase II (MII) to
the total oocytes retrieved. The fertilization
rate was calculated as the ratio of two-
pronuclear zygote (2PN) oocytes to MII.
The good-quality embryo rate was calcu-
lated as the number of good-quality
embryos multiplied by that of 2PN oocytes.
The clinical pregnancy rate was calculated as
the number of gestational sacs multiplied by
that of transferred fresh embryos. The abor-
tion rate was calculated as the ratio of
spontaneous abortion cases to clinical preg-
nancy cases. The take-home newborn rate
was calculated as the birth number divided
by the number of fresh embryos transferred.
The implantation rate was calculated as the
number of gestational sacs multiplied by
that of transferred embryos.
Follow-up and observational indices
The follow-up examinations included serum
levels of hCG 14 days after transplantation
to determine the success of pregnancy.
Subsequently, transvaginal ultrasound was
performed to determine intrauterine preg-
nancy, gestational sac number, and embryo
heart beats 14 days later. The patients were
then followed up by telephone interviews
until 3, 5, and 8 months of pregnancy when
ultrasound examinations were conducted to
assess foetal development. Data regarding
the mode of delivery, number of neonates,
body weight, sex, and deformities at birth
were also collected.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with
SPSS 17.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Normally distributed variables are pre-
sented as mean Æ standard deviation (SD),
and were assessed by the two independent
samples t-test. Frequencies were compared
with the chi-square test. Correlations
between AMH and the other indices were
evaluated with Pearson's correlation ana-
lysis. Multivariate analysis was performed
to evaluate whether there were relationships
between bAMH or FF AMH levels and
demographic variables with IVF outcome.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Overall population characteristics
The mean age of patients in the PCOS and
control groups was 29.1 Æ 3.5 and 30.3 Æ 3.9
years old, respectively (P > 0.05). Mean
body mass index (BMI) was 22.2 Æ 3.2 and
21.4 Æ 2.9 kg/m2, respectively (P > 0.05).
AFC, peak E2, bAMH levels, and FF
AMH levels in the PCOS group were sig-
nificantly higher than those in the control
group (all P < 0.01).
COH and IVF results
Oocyte maturation and good-quality
embryo rates in the PCOS group were
markedly lower than those in the control
group (all P < 0.01). However, there were no
significant differences in fertilization,
implantation, abortion, and take-home
newborn rates between the two groups (all
P > 0.05, Table 1).
In the PCOS group, women who were
considered at risk of OHSS later received
FET, but 46 women received fresh embryo
transfer (including 23 women in each sub-
group), of whom 22 women achieved a
clinical pregnancy. All 120 controls received
Chen et al. 1141
fresh embryos, including 73 who were suc-
cessfully impregnated and two with ectopic
pregnancies. According to the 2009 guide-
lines by Golan and Weissman concerning
OHSS,21,22 because women at risk received
FET, there were no moderate or severe
OHSS cases.
In patients with PCOS, no differences
were found in indices, including IVF out-
come measures (Table 2), compared with the
antagonist subgroup. An exception was
peak E2 values, which were lower in the
agonist subgroup than in the antagonist
subgroup (P < 0.05).
Associations of AMH levels and
IVF outcome
In the control group, positive correlations
were observed between bAMH or FF AMH
levels and the AFC, oocyte number, fertil-
ization, and good-quality embryo number

(all P < 0.01). In the PCOS group, positive
correlations were found between bAMH or
FF AMH levels and the antral follicle count
(AFC) (P < 0.01) (Table 3).
Predictors of oocyte number and
fertilization rate
Several parameters were assessed for their
predictive value of oocyte number and fer-
tilization rate, including age, BMI, bFSH,
peak E2, gonadotrophin dose, bAMH, FF
AMH, and AFC. As shown in Table 4, peak
E2 (P < 0.001) and FF AMH levels
(P ¼ 0.040) were independent predictors of
oocyte number. Peak E2 had a significant
predictive value for the fertilization rate
(P < 0.001). The remaining parameters
were not significant independent predictors
of oocyte number or the fertilization rate
(P > 0.05) (Table 4).
Discussion
This study aimed to assess the possible
associations of bAMH or FF AMH levels
with IVF outcome in patients with PCOS.
We also evaluated two protocols that were
designed for IVF in patients with PCOS for
their effects on IVF outcome. No signifi-
cant differences were found in fertilization,
implantation, clinical pregnancy, and take-
home newborn rates among the groups.
Serum AMH levels correlate well with ovar-
ian reserve.13,14 In our study, positive cor-
relations were observed between bAMH or
FF AMH levels and the AFC, oocyte
number, fertilization, and good-quality
embryos in control women without PCOS.
However, in the PCOS group, a positive
correlation was only observed between
bAMH or FF AMH levels and the AFC.
These findings suggest that AMH levels are a
good predictor of IVF outcome in women
without PCOS undergoing fertility treat-
ment.10,12,23 Our findings are in contrast to
a previous study9 and a recent meta-
analysis.15 Notably, our results are in agree-
ment with previous reports, which showed
that AMH levels were not a reliable pre-
dictor of IVF outcome in women with
PCOS.18,19 Therefore, AMH levels have
different predictive values with various
patient populations, and should be used
with caution as a measure of IVF outcome.
Measurement of ovarian reserve includes
the quantity and quality of oocytes growing
in follicles that can mature and eventually be
fertilized. Regrettably, there are no non-
invasive methods available for assessment of
ovarian reserve, and oocytes cannot be seen
by the naked eye. Therefore, the AFC has
become a surrogate for oocyte quantity. In
our study, bAMH levels were highly and

positively associated with the AFC in both
patient groups, as well as with the number of
oocytes retrieved after ovarian stimulation
in control patients. FF AMH and bAMH
levels in patients with PCOS were signifi-
cantly higher than those in non-PCOS
patients. Additionally, the AFC and the
number of oocytes retrieved from patients
with PCOS were significantly higher than
those obtained from control patients. These
results suggest that bAMH values reflect the
quantity of oocytes in ovaries to a certain
extent. Therefore, in terms of the quantita-
tive aspect of ovarian reserve, the higher the
serum AMH level, the greater the number of
antral follicles and oocytes. Therefore, indi-
vidualized COH protocols based on serum
AMH levels might eliminate serious OHSS
and decrease cancellation of IVF cycles.
Because no valid method is available for
assessment of oocyte quality, indirect indices
are used, including oocyte maturation and
clinical pregnancy rates. We obtained dis-
crepant data on the predictive value of
AMH levels for oocyte quality. Maturation
and good-quality embryo rates in the PCOS
group were significantly lower than those in
the control group. However, no differences
were found in fertilization, embryo implant-
ation, clinical pregnancy, abortion, and
take-home newborn rates between the two
groups. Additionally, FF AMH levels were
an independent predictor of oocyte num-
ber, but not of the fertilization rate.
Therefore, we speculate that serum AMH
levels do not necessarily reflect the quality of
oocytes.
When women with PCOS also have
fallopian tube or male factor fertility prob-
lems, IVF becomes an important method of
treatment. The standard long agonist proto-
col is the conventional and most common
method of COH during IVF. However, the
antagonist protocol is increasingly being

contemplated because of its shorter therapy
time and lower gonadotrophin dosage.24
Indeed, the incidence of OHSS can be
reduced by the antagonist protocol, which
is important for patients with PCOS, par-
ticularly owing to their risk of severe com-
plications involving OHSS.24 In this study,
no cases of moderate or severe OHSS
occurred. This may be due, at least in part,
to the seven and six patients who chose to
freeze good-quality embryos in the agonist
and antagonist subgroups, respectively. This
finding might have also resulted from
administration of Voluven and prednisone
for 3 days from the day of ovum collection
to prevent the women from having OHSS
when a high risk of OHSS was expected. No
significant differences in in bAMH or FF
AMH levels were found between patients
undergoing the long and antagonist proto-
cols. This finding is in agreement with a
previous report24 in which FF AMH levels
were not mentioned. In our study, there
were no significant differences in the number
of oocytes retrieved, as well as maturation,
fertilization, good-quality embryo, implant-
ation, clinical pregnancy, and take-home
newborn rates, between protocols.
These results suggest that the antagonist
protocol has no advantage of improving
clinical outcomes in patients with PCOS
undergoing IVF.
Favourable oocyte growth and normal
embryo development after fertilization are
greatly affected by the constituents of the
FF, which directly surrounds the oocytes.
AMH, which is secreted by granulosa cells,
not only plays a role in blood circulation,
but also plays a part in the autocrine and
paracrine pathways.25 FF AMH values
might effectively predict the outcomes in
women with PCOS or those without PCOS
after IVF therapy.23,26,27 However, discrep-
ant data were obtained in this study, with
significant positive correlations between FF
AMH levels and maturation, fertilization,
and good-quality embryos in the control
group, but not in the PCOS group. These
data are consistent with Mashiach's study.28
Taken together, these findings suggest that
the value of FF AMH levels in predicting
pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS
or those without PCOS after IVF is incon-
sistent. Recently, a report showed that in
normal ovulatory women, secretion and
protein expression of FF AMH by small
follicles are greatly increased compared with
those in medium or big follicles.29 This
phenomenon is not observed in women with
PCOS. FF AMH levels in follicles that were
unstimulated by exogenous gonadotrophin
were five times higher in patients with PCOS
compared with controls.29,30 These studies
suggest a pathological imbalance in the
expression and secretion of AMH in patients
with PCOS, which may have a correlation
with abnormal follicular recruitment and
development of PCOS.
In conclusion, use of AMH as a reliable
indicator of ovarian reserve is important
because it represents the numbers of pre-
antral and small antral follicles. For patients
with PCOS who have a high risk of OHSS,
AMH levels should be assessed to predict
and help prevent OHSS. Whether the con-
ventional long protocol can be replaced by
the antagonist protocol in IVF for patients
with PCOS needs to be confirmed by further
studies.
