Abstract
Objective: To elucidate the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on
steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head in rats.
Methods: Twenty-four adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups of eight rats
each. The rats in the positive control group were injected with dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg twice a
week for 5 weeks. The rats in the negative control group were injected with sodium chloride alone.
The rats in the experimental group were injected with dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg twice a week for
5 weeks and rHuEPO (500 u/d/kg) daily for 5 weeks. The femoral head on one side was examined
by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and that on the other side was examined by CD31 staining of the
capillaries.
Results: Hematoxylin and eosin staining in the positive control group showed that the bony
trabeculae had become obviously narrow and sparse with discontinuity of the integrity. The
integrity of the trabeculae was better in the experimental group than positive control group. The
CD31 expression was lower in the positive control group than in the other two groups.
Conclusion: rHuEPO can effectively prevent osteocyte apoptosis, delaying or decreasing
osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

SANFH leads to degeneration and necrosis
of the subchondral bone, collapse of the
femoral head, and eventual disease related
to retrogressive damage of the hip joint.1,2
With the wide clinical application of ster-
oids, the incidence of SANFH-associated
morbidity has been increasing in China
each year. Common clinical characteristics
of such morbidity include short onset
(Short onset is equivalent to fast onset.It
means that the disease is progressing fast),
collapse of the femoral head, a poor prog-
nosis, and a high disability rate.
Consequently, SANFH is associated with
great economic and psychological burdens
on patients and society and has a severe
impact on patients' quality of life.
Research on prevention measures has
great clinical and social significance. The
final link in the pathogenesis of SANFH is
mainly the insufficient blood supply to the
femoral head, which is an obstacle to
revascularization and leads to subsequent
necrocytosis.3 Therefore, the key to curing
SANFH is to adopt effective means and
then promote revascularization and new
bone formation in the necrotic zone.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a single-stranded
acidoglycoprotein with a molecular weight
of about 30 kDa and thermal stability at
80C. Previous research indicates that EPO
not only accelerates erythropoiesis but also
exhibits a cytoprotective effect, especially by
preventing apoptosis of endothelial cells,
nerve cells, and myocardiocytes, and accel-
erates the generation of new vessels.
Increased research of EPO and its receptor
has in turn increased the number of reports
on clinical treatment using EPO, and its
applications are being continually
expanded.4 Because dexamethasone (Dex)
is the most commonly used steroid in clinical
practice, we chose it to establish an SANFH
model. This animal study was performed
to elucidate the preventive effect of recom-
binant human EPO (rHuEPO) on SANFH
in rats.
Materials and methods
Establishment of rat SANFH
This study included 24 healthy adult Wistar
rats (12 male, 12 female; weight of about
300 g). All were bred under the same condi-
tions (fed a common pelleted diet and
maintained under natural lighting with a
temperature of 20C Æ 2C and humidity of
about 50%). They were weighed 1 week
after adaptive feeding and randomly divided
into three groups of eight rats each (four
male, four female) using a random number
table: the positive control group, negative
control group, and experimental group. The
body weights of the rats were not signifi-
cantly different among these three groups
according to one-way analysis of variance.
During the experiment, the animals were
handled based on the Guidance Opinion
about Kindly Treating Animals (Ningbo
University) released by the Ministry of
Science and Technology in 2006. The
animal model was established as follows.
Rats in the positive control group were
injected with Dex at 1 mg/kg body weight
in the rear leg muscle twice a week for 5
consecutive weeks. Rats in the negative
control group were injected with an equiva-
lent volume of normal saline in the rear leg
muscle twice a week for 5 consecutive weeks.
Rats in the experimental group were injected
with Dex at 1 mg/kg body weight in the rear
leg muscle twice a week for 5 consecutive
weeks and intraperitoneally injected with
rHuEPO at 500 u/d/kg body weight once
daily for 5 consecutive weeks.
General observation
The status of the rats was observed every
day, and data were collected on survival,
appetite, activity level, weight change, excre-
tion, superficial wounds and infection, and
other factors. The rats were weighed every
week. All rats were given 2 h of free activities
outside the cage every day to increase their
Jiang et al. 1325
activity range and make the model as real-
istic to daily life as possible.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining
All rats were killed by bloodletting under
anesthesia after 5 weeks. Bilateral femoral
head specimens were histopathologically
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE)
and immunohistochemically stained with
CD31. The surrounding soft issue was care-
fully removed to determine whether the
femoral head was smooth and complete and
whether the color and form of the coronalis
was normal. The resistance was also checked.
The obtained specimens were fixed with
formaldehyde solution (0.1 mol/L, pH ¼ 7.4)
with a 10% volume fraction at 4C for 4
days, washed with phosphate-buffered saline,
decalcified at 37.4C in EDTA­Tris buffer
solution with a 10% volume fraction, and
decalcified at 37.4C. The decalcification
liquid was changed once a week. The surface
of the bone specimen was observed, and its
degree of decalcification was measured
through a physical method. Get material
after the complete decalcification. The speci-
men was the dehydrated in increasing gradi-
ents of ethyl alcohol. The xylene was handled
transparently for 2 hours. The specimen was
embedded in paraffin and observed by HE
staining. An optical microscope was used to
observe the bone tissue, marrow tissue, and
bone trabecular structure.
Immunohistochemical CD31 staining
The specimen of the femoral head proper
was cut horizontally along the coronal
plane, immediately placed into 40 g/L par-
aformaldehyde stationary liquid, and then
placed in a refrigerator at 4C for 48 hours.
It was commonly cut through general SP
immunohistochemical paraffin, and immu-
nohistochemical testing was performed to
evaluate the expression of CD31 in the rat
femoral head. CD31 positivity was indicated
by the presence of yellow particles in the
vascular endothelial cells. Under a micro-
scopic camera, each immunohistochemical
side was observed by randomly selecting
three different views (Â400). The count
presents yellow positive expression vessel.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean Æ standard
deviation. Statistical analyses were per-
formed with PASW Statistics for Windows
18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and differ-
ences between groups were tested with the
mean t value. A P value of < 0.05 indicates a
significant difference, and P < 0.01 indicates
a remarkably significant difference.
Results
General condition of the rats
The rats of each group remained in good
condition throughout the study. Five weeks
after beginning treatment, the hair on the
hind limbs and backs of most rats in the
positive control group and experimental
group became sparse, and the activity level
of some animals in the positive control
group decreased. The other two groups
showed no obvious abnormalities.
Observation of HE staining results
(1) Negative control group: The bony tra-
beculae in both male and female rats had an
integral circular or oval-type arch structure
and high connectivity without osteoclasts,
narrowed bone trabeculae, or fractures
(Figure 1). (2) Positive control group: The
bony trabeculae of three male rats became
sparse, narrow, and fractured; the connect-
ivity was reduced, some arch structures
disappeared, the form became irregular,
and the partitions of the bony trabeculae
were decreased. Many osteoclasts were pre-
sent, and some nuclei had shrunken, dis-
solved, or disappeared. These lesions were

found in three of the female rats; two other
rats showed different degrees of bone tra-
becular narrowing, decreased connectivity,
and other lesions (Figure 2). (3)
Experimental group: Compared with the
positive control group, the lesions in both
male and female rats in the experimental
group were obviously alleviated. The bony
trabeculae were relatively regular in form.
The connectivity was markedly superior to
that in the positive control group. Some
bony trabeculae had become coarse. The
fracture rate was obviously decreased.
Connection and repair had occurred in the
defects. Some of the structure resembled
that of the normal group. The degree of
partitioning of the bony trabeculae was
relatively high, and many visible osteoblasts
were present (Figure 3).
The bony trabeculae were complete and
their arrangement was regular. The osteo-
blasts were clearly visible. The marrow was
rich with hematopoietic cells, and relatively
few fat cells were present. No osteoclasts

became narrow and exhibited fractures.
The bony trabeculae were obviously sparse
and broken and showed a chaotic, irregular
morphology. Some of the arch structure had
disappeared. The number of empty bone
lacunae was increased. The degree of parti-
tioning of the bony trabeculae was decreased,
and many osteoclasts were present. Some
visible bone nuclei had shrunken and dis-
solved, and some had disappeared.
The connectivity of the bony trabeculae
was obviously better than that in the positive
control group. Some trabeculae had become
coarse, and the fracture rate was obviously
decreased. Connectivity and repair had
occurred in the defects. Some of the struc-
ture was close to that in the normal group.
The degree of partitioning of the bony
trabeculae was relatively high, and many
osteoblasts were visible.
Immunohistochemical expression of CD31
Immunohistochemical staining for CD31
was clearly and selectively present in the
endothelial cells. Positivity was indicated by
the presence of yellow particles. The degree
of vascular staining was evaluated by view-
ing of random areas under the microscope.
CD31 expression was lower in the positive
control group than in the negative control
group and experimental group (Table 1).
(1) Negative control group: CD31 expres-
sion was strong, and the blood supply of the
femoral head was sufficient. The microcir-
culation was normal (Figure 4(a)). (2)
Positive control group: CD31 staining was
obviously decreased, and the light yellow
color indicated that the microcirculation
was insufficient. The blood supply to the
femoral head was significantly decreased
(P < 0.001) (Figure 4(b)). (3) Experimental
group: The CD31 expression and the

Discussion
SANFH is a disease caused by improper use
of steroids, which damage the blood supply
of the femoral head, resulting in osteonecro-
sis of the bony trabeculae and marrow in
some parts of the femoral head. Steroids and
their metabolites act as strong inhibitors of
vessel growth by inhibiting capillary growth
and regeneration and promoting capillary
degeneration. Zhang et al.5 reported that
steroids can induce apoptosis of micro-
vascular endothelial cells, resulting in
reduced numbers of capillaries. This may
give rise to disorders of the microcirculation.
When high-dose glucocorticoids are used for
a long period of time, the microvascular
density and thus blood perfusion of the
femoral head decrease, which in turn
decreases the blood flow. This lack of
blood flow leads to hypoxia and fatty
degeneration of bone cells. When the hyp-
oxia and blood shortage reach a certain
threshold, bone osteonecrosis will occur.
Many treatment methods are currently
available for protecting the femoral head.
Core decompression is regarded as the most
common technique for treatment of early-
stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The
aim of this technique is to reduce the internal
pressure inside the femoral head and recover
the normal blood circulation. The core
drilling required for decompression helps
to improve the blood circulation of the bone
and alleviate marrow edema, thus prevent-
ing or postponing disease progression.
EPO is a glycoprotein that is mainly
secreted from the kidney. It can stimulate
the proliferation and differentiation of
reticulocytes and endothelial cells; promote
cell regeneration and vessel formation; resist
inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis; and
accelerate vessel formation, cell prolifer-
ation, and cell protection. On one hand,
EPO can increase red blood cell production
to improve tissue oxygen perfusion, thereby
affecting the processes of tissue reshaping
and fibrosis in patients with chronic heart
failure and renal dysfunction. On the other
hand, EPO resists oxidation and apoptosis,
decreases inflammatory symptoms, reduces
cardiac and renal tissue injury, and pro-
motes angiogenesis.6 Some studies have
revealed that EPO may improve cardiac
function and reduce the hospitalization
rate in patients with cardiac failure and

anemia.7­10 Zheng et al.11 used real-time
polymerase chain reaction to detect EphB4
expression and gene expression related to
osteoblasts by breeding a rat bone marrow-
derived stromal cell line (ST2) in vitro after
adding EPO. The calcium deposition was
obviously higher in the EPO group than in
the control group, and the expression of
genes related to RUNX2, Col1, and ALP
were correspondingly increased. These find-
ings show that EPO plays an important role
in promoting osteoblast differentiation and
function.
Hu et al.12 discovered that ischemia and
reperfusion­induced renal dysfunction in
rats was remarkably improved by EPO,
which worked to inhibit p38MAPK, reduce
the TNF-a level, and alleviate the inflam-
matory injury. These findings have implica-
tions for improvement in early renal
function recovery after kidney transplant-
ation. In their animal experiment, Ishii
et al.13 found that EPO pre-processing
could reduce the cerebral infarction area
and number of apoptotic nerve cells, thereby
alleviating the damage induced by cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Ahn et al.14
ligated the femoral artery to establish an
animal model of acute artery embolism and
studied the influence of EPO on blood
perfusion in the lower limbs of rats. The
experimental results indicated that EPO can
accelerate vessel generation, improve blood
flow, and effectively improve the circulation
of the lower limbs. These findings provide
insight and an experimental basis for clinical
recovery of blood perfusion after acute
artery embolism.
In the present study, we evaluated
the effects of rHuEPO for treatment of
SANFH by studying the mechanism
of SANFH-associated morbidity and
EPO-induced improvements in the micro-
circulation and apoptosis. Our main find-
ings are as follows. The HE staining results
in the positive control group showed that
the bony trabeculae in five of the eight rats
had become obviously sparse, narrow, and
broken and exhibited a low connectivity
rate. The remaining three rats showed
different degrees of narrowing of the
bony trabeculae and decreased connectivity
rates. The establishment of this experimen-
tal model was successful. The histopatho-
logic examination showed greater
alleviation of the lesions in the experimen-
tal group than in the positive control
group, the bony trabeculae were more
regular in form, the degree of connectivity
was obviously better than that in the
positive control group, connectivity and
recovery had occurred in the defects, and
many osteoblasts were visible. These find-
ings prove that rHuEPO can reduce bone
cell apoptosis and thereby prevent the
occurrence of osteonecrosis of the femoral
head.15 The femoral head CD31 staining
count in the experimental group was
15.61 Æ 3.13 (male) and 18.94 Æ 4.22
(female), which was significantly higher
than that in the positive control group
[12.72 Æ 3.39 (male) and 14.11 Æ 5.02
(female), P < 0.05]. Thus, rHuEPO may
increase the blood supply of the femoral
head and help to prevent osteonecrosis by
improving the microcirculation. The results
of this experiment might lead to the use of
rHuEPO to prevent the occurrence of
femoral head necrosis in patients undergo-
ing long-term treatment with steroids.
In summary, the pathogenesis of SANFH
remains unclear. Apoptosis and tissue ische-
mia may be contributors. The use of
rHuEPO in the early treatment period to
prevent osteonecrosis of the femoral head
has achieved a certain short-term curative
effect. However, its long-term effect and
preventive mechanism require further
research and observation.
