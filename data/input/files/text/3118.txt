Among US Adults With Diabetes

Background: Walking is associated with reduced dia-
betes incidence, but few studies have examined whether
it reduces mortality among those who already have dia-
betes.
Objective: To estimate the association between walk-
ing and the risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) mortality among persons with diabetes.
Design: Prospective cohort study of a representative
sample of the US population.
Setting: Interviewer-administered survey in the gen-
eral community.
Participants: We sampled 2896 adults 18 years and older
with diabetes as part of the 1990 and 1991 National Health
Interview Survey.
Main Outcome Measure: All-cause and CVD mor-
tality for 8 years.
Results: Compared with inactive individuals, those who
walked at least 2 h/wk had a 39% lower all-cause mor-
tality rate (hazard rate ratio [HRR], 0.61; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.48-0.78; 2.8% vs 4.4% per year)
and a 34% lower CVD mortality rate (HRR, 0.66; 95%
CI, 0.45-0.96; 1.4% vs 2.1% per year). We controlled for
sex, age, race, body mass index (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters),
smoking, and comorbid conditions. The mortality rates
were lowest for persons who walked 3 to 4 h/wk (all-
cause mortality HRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.71; CVD mor-
tality HRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) and for those who
reported that their walking involved moderate in-
creases in heart and breathing rates (all-cause mortality
HRR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.80; CVD mortality HRR, 0.69;
95% CI, 0.43-1.09). The protective association of physi-
cal activity was observed for persons of varying sex, age,
race, body mass index, diabetes duration, comorbid con-
ditions, and physical limitations.
Conclusions: Walking was associated with lower mor-
tality across a diverse spectrum of adults with diabetes.
One death per year may be preventable for every 61 people
who could be persuaded to walk at least 2 h/wk.

REGULAR PHYSICAL activity
has been associated with re-
duced risk for cardiovascu-
lar disease (CVD), diabe-
tes, and death in the general
population.1-6 Similarly, walking and other
forms of exercise were key components of
lifestyle changes shown to prevent pro-
gression to diabetes among people with
impaired glucose tolerance.7-9 For people
who already have diabetes, physical ac-
tivity has been shown to improve insulin
sensitivity, glycemic control, and CVD risk
factors.10-12
Less clear, however, is the impact of
physical activity, particularly simple ac-
tivities such as walking, on the long-term
outcomes of people with diabetes. Only 2
studies have examined the association of
physical activity with the incidences of dis-
ease and death among persons with dia-
betes.13,14 Both studies associated physi-
cal activity with reduced CVD or all-
cause mortality, but they were composed
of participants who were younger and
likely healthier than the general diabetic
population.
Diabetes leads to an array of dis-
abling complications, including visual
impairment, peripheral and autonomic
neuropathy, silent ischemia, cardiac ar-
rhythmias, and an increased risk for sud-
den death.15-17 These complications could
make physical activity less feasible for
people with diabetes and thereby limit its
effects on the long-term health outcomes
of the group as a whole. Physical activity
also might not be as effective among people
who have multiple comorbid conditions
associated with diabetes.

Because of these uncertainties about the effects of
physical activity on people with diabetes, we attempted to
determine how physical activity, particularly moderate-
intensity activity, affects mortality risk across the full spec-
trum of adults with diabetes. In 1990 and 1991, special sur-
veys examined physical activity as part of the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a representative sample
oftheUSpopulation.18,19 Afollow-upofcause-specificmor-
tality conducted in 199720 gave us a unique opportunity
to examine the relationship of walking and other physical
activities to mortality risk among US adults with diabetes.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION
The NHIS is an ongoing survey of the health status and behav-
iors of the US noninstitutionalized population.18,19 The NHIS uses
multistage probability sampling to select approximately 45000
households and 120000 individuals each year. The overall re-
sponse rate is approximately 95%. In this study, we used data on
physical activity and health status collected from supplemental
health promotion surveys conducted in 1990 and 1991 on a total
of 84836 randomly subsampled adult respondents (41104 in a
1990 survey and 43732 in a 1991 survey). The response rates for
the supplements were 87% in 1990 and 92% in 1991.
Data from 82985 (98%) of the respondents were linked
to the National Death Index, a computer database of all deaths
in the United States.20 In the linked sample, 3506 individuals
reported having diabetes. Of these, we excluded 78 persons who
had missing data on physical activity, 123 who had missing data
on covariates, and 409 who were disabled and thus not asked
all the physical activity questions. This left 2896 persons for
whom we examined the association between physical activity
levels in 1990 through 1991 and mortality during the next 8
years.
DIABETES AND
HEALTH STATUS MEASUREMENTS
In the 1990 and 1991 surveys, interviewers assessed diabetes
status, age, race, sex, smoking, hypertension and use of anti-
hypertensive medications, self-rated health (5-point scale rang-
ing from excellent to poor), hospitalizations, and physician vis-
its in the prior year. Participants also reported their height and
weight, which were used to compute body mass index (BMI,
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters) and were asked whether they were trying to lose
weight and whether they were cutting calories, attending a spe-
cial program, or using special products to lose weight. Partici-
pants were asked to describe activity limitations (ie, unable,
limited, or not limited) and, if they had limitations, to identify
the primary and secondary health conditions that led to the limi-
tations. Using these responses, we categorized participants ac-
cording to whether any CVD or cancer was a reported cause of
their physical limitations. In the 1990 survey, participants were
also asked whether they ever had a heart condition or stroke18
and in 1991, participants were asked their age at diabetes di-
agnosis and whether they take insulin.19
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT
In the 1990-1991 surveys, participants were asked how often
they had walked for exercise during the previous 2 weeks, the
average number of minutes they spent walking each time, and
how much their heart and breathing rates increased (ie, no in-
crease, small, medium, or large) while walking.18,19,21 Partici-
pants were also asked whether they had participated in other
sports or physical activities. Because the physical activities as-
sessed in the 1990 and 1991 surveys varied slightly (eg, stretch-
ing was not assessed in 1990 and calisthenics were not as-
sessed in 1991), we limited our assessment to the 10 most
common physical activities that were assessed in both survey
years. Aside from walking, these activities were gardening, jog-
ging, aerobics, cycling, swimming, weight lifting, golf, basket-
ball, and tennis. We then calculated the total number of hours
per week that participants spent walking and the total hours
per week they spent doing any leisure physical activity. Occu-
pational physical activity was only assessed in the 1990 survey
and was not included in these analyses.
MORTALITY ASSESSMENT
Mortality was determined by matching the respondent to the
National Death Index using an algorithm provided by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics to determine which matches
should be classified as deaths.20 The participants' vital status
was available from the time of the survey (1990-1991) through
December 31, 1997 (up to 8 years). Underlying causes of death
were classified according to the codes of the International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.22 Deaths coded 410 to 448
were classified as CVD deaths.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We used 2 tests and analysis of variance to compare study co-
variates according to walking level at baseline. Age-adjusted mor-
tality rates were standardized to the age structure of the US popu-
lationwithdiagnoseddiabetesduringthe1990-1991surveyperiod.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to deter-
mine the mortality hazard rate ratio (HRR) associated with the
numbers of hours per week they spent walking and performing
anyleisureactivityandtheirself-perceivedwalkingintensity,while
adjustingforpotentiallyconfoundingvariables.Multivariatemod-
els controlled for age, race, sex, hypertension and the use of an-
tihypertensive medications, weight loss approaches (as previ-
ously described), number of days hospitalized, smoking (former
and current), CVD or cancer that could be attributed to im-
paired functioning, and the level of activity limitation in major
daily activities. We also controlled for self-rated health because
it is highly predictive of mortality,23 and thus may account for
additional variation in baseline health status among physical ac-
tivity groups.
Because the duration of walking could vary with its in-
tensity, we also examined the association between walking in-
tensity and mortality, stratified by duration. Also, associations
between walking and mortality could be explained by partici-
pation in other types of physical activity. Thus, we conducted
additional analyses in which we controlled for total physical
activity and excluded persons participating in moderate- or high-
intensity activities (5 metabolic equivalents), and reporting
higher levels (2 h/wk) of nonwalking physical activity.
We conducted additional analyses using the 1990 sample
wherein we separately examined regression models to control
for stroke and heart conditions. Similarly, we conducted analy-
ses within the 1991 sample controlling for insulin use and time
since diabetes diagnosis.
We examined several potential interactions, including
whether the relationship between walking and mortality risk was
modified by sex, race, age, BMI, or comorbid conditions (ie, func-
tionallimitationsassociatedwithCVDorcancer).Weappliedsur-
vey weights to make study estimates representative of the US non-
institutionalized adult population with diabetes. Analyses were

RESULTS
At baseline, the mean age of the population was 58.7 years
(range, 18-95 years). Their mean BMI was 28.4, and their
average time since diabetes diagnosis was 11.0 years
(Table 1). Of the total population, 16.6% were non-
Hispanic black, 7.9% were Hispanic, and 2.6% were of
other nonwhite race/ethnicity. When characterized by
BMI,39.2%wereoverweight(BMI,25-29)and32.4%were
obese (BMI, 30). In addition, 35.9% of the population
reported using insulin, 29.1% reported heart disease, and
45.5% reported having a limitation in daily function.
In regard to walking, 46.0% of the population re-
ported any walking for exercise and 20.7% reported walk-
ing for at least 2 h/wk. Aside from walking, the most com-
monly reported activities were gardening (25.1%), cycling
(9.7%), weight lifting (4.0%), swimming (3.9%), aerobics
(2.4%), jogging (2.4%), golf (2.1%), basketball (1.6%), and
tennis (0.7%) (data not shown), and 61.8% reported per-
formance of any leisure time physical activity.
Compared with less active persons, those report-
ing higher levels of walking were more likely to be men,
to report trying to lose weight, and to have better self-
rated health (P.05). Age, smoking prevalence, and ac-
tivity limitations were lowest among those reporting some
(0 to 1.9 h/wk) walking (P.01). Participants' race/
ethnicity, BMI, time since diabetes diagnosis, insulin use,
number of physician visits, hospitalizations, and his-
tory of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke, and ac-
tivity limitations related to CVD and cancer were not sig-
nificantly associated with their baseline walking level.
During 8.0 years of follow-up, 671 study participants died
(3.7/100 person-years), including 316 who died of CVD
(1.7/100 person-years).
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MORTALITY
Higher levels of walking and total physical activity were
each associated with a lower incidence of all-cause and
CVD mortality (Table 2). Compared with participants
who reported no walking, those who walked at least 2
h/wk had a 39% lower all-cause mortality rate (HRR, 0.61;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.78) and a 34% re-

duced CVD mortality risk (HRR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-
0.96), controlled for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, utili-
zation of health care services, attempts to lose weight,
and comorbid conditions. Participants who reported at
least 2 h/wk of total leisure-time physical activity had a
29% lower all-cause mortality risk (HRR, 0.71; 95% CI,
0.59-0.87) and a 24% (nonsignificantly) lower CVD mor-
tality risk (HRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57-1.03) than inactive
participants. The associations among walking, physical
activity, and lowered mortality were similar or slightly
stronger when we excluded persons with disability. We
also found similar walking-related mortality rate reduc-
tions after we excluded deaths that occurred in the 2 years
of follow-up (data not shown).
The reduction in mortality corresponded to a 1.6%
absolute difference in age-adjusted, all-cause annual mor-
tality between those who walked at least 2 hours (2.8%)
and those who did not walk (4.4%) and a 0.7% differ-
ence in annual CVD mortality rates between those who
walked at least 2 hours (1.4%) and those who did not
walk (2.1%). Thus, among diabetic adults, one death per
year may be preventable for every 61 people who could
be persuaded to walk at least 2 h/wk. One CVD death
per year may be preventable for every 145 persuaded to
walk at least 2 h/wk.
We found that controlling for participants' insulin
status and disease duration using data from the 1991 sur-
vey had little effect on the association between walking
and mortality (data not shown). Similarly, controlling for
heart trouble and history of stroke using the 1990 sur-
vey sample did not alter the association between walk-
ing and mortality. However, the CIs for these associa-
tions were broader because these analyses relied on only
half of the overall sample.
WALKING DURATION AND
INTENSITY AND MORTALITY
We found that a greater duration of walking was asso-
ciated with a lower all-cause mortality rate (for trend,
P=.004) (Table 3). The greatest risk reduction was
among those walking 3 to 3.9 h/wk (HRR, 0.46; 95% CI,
0.29-0.71). This group had a similar reduction in CVD
mortality risk (HRR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91), but we
found no significant linear trend, and the surrounding
point estimates were broader because of the smaller num-
ber of CVD deaths. The association between time spent
walking and mortality rates was similar after we ex-
cluded deaths that occurred during the first 2 years of
follow-up (data not shown). We also found that control-
ling for physical activity other than walking and exclud-
ing persons who participated in moderate or vigorous ac-
tivities or performed greater than 2 h/wk of nonwalking
physical activity had no appreciable effect on the asso-
ciation between walking and mortality.
Higher levels of perceived walking intensity were as-
sociated with a reduced all-cause mortality rate (for trend,
P=.006). Compared with participants who reported no
walking, those who reported no, some, and moderate in-
creases in heart rate or breathing rate had reductions in
mortality rates of 5% (HRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76-1.17),
31% (HRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.95), and 43% (HRR, 0.57;
95%CI,0.41-0.80),respectively.Thosewhoreportedlarge
increases in heart rate or breathing rate did not have sig-
nificantly reduced all-cause mortality (HRR, 0.93; 95%
CI, 0.50-1.71), but the risk reduction was greater after
we excluded deaths that occurred in the first 2 years of
follow-up (HRR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.34-1.29) (data not
shown). Only 3% of the population reported large in-
creases in heart rate or breathing rate with walking, and
limited statistical power (22 deaths) was available to ex-
amine mortality in this group.
Associationsbetweenperceivedwalkingintensityand
CVD mortality were weaker than for all-cause mortal-
ity. Again, we found the greatest reductions in CVD mor-
tality risk were among those who reported moderate in-
creases in heart rate or breathing rate while walking,
although the association was not statistically significant
(HRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.43-1.09). Participants who re-
ported large increases in heart rate or breathing rate had
a nonsignificant 12% increased mortality risk (HRR, 1.12;
95% CI, 0.45-2.78), but after excluding the first 2 years

of follow-up, we found this group to have a nonsignifi-
cant, 24% reduced mortality risk (HRR, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.24-2.44) (data not shown).
When we categorized individuals by combining
time spent walking and perceived walking intensity
(Table 4), the lowest mortality rates were for those
who reported walking at least 2 h/wk with some
increases in heart rate or breathing rate (HRR, 0.55;
95% CI, 0.35-0.86) or moderate increases in heart rate
or breathing rate (HRR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.68).
Large increases in heart rate or breathing rate were not
significantly associated with mortality risk, regardless
of the time spent walking, but again the statistical
power was limited by the small sample size and num-
ber of deaths (n=9).
SUBGROUP ANALYSES
When we stratified our analyses, the magnitude of the
all-cause mortality risk reduction associated with
walking at least 2 h/wk did not vary appreciably
according to participants' sex, age, race, obesity, time
since diabetes diagnosis, functional limitations, or
presence of comorbid conditions. The greatest differ-
ence in HRRs was for the comparison between those
with (HRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.99) and without
comorbid conditions (HRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36-0.75)
(Figure). However, we found no statistically signifi-
cant interactions between physical activity level and
any of these stratifications. Confidence intervals were
broader and overlapped 1 in some cases, because there
were fewer individuals in several of these strata. Also,
we had inadequate power to assess associations with
mortality among persons who were more likely to
have type 1 diabetes (132 persons, or 7.4% of the 1991
sample), but we found no difference in results when
we excluded these persons from our analyses.

sure time physical activity were associated with signifi-
cant reductions in all-cause and CVD mortality. Spe-
cifically, walking at least 2 h/wk was associated with a
34% to 39% reduction in all-cause and CVD mortality
rate, and even greater amounts of walking (ie, about
3-4 h/wk) were associated with up to a 54% reduction
in mortality. We also found that walking at moderate
intensity levels was associated with the greatest reduc-
tion in mortality rates. Overall, these findings support
current recommendations that brisk walking on a
regular basis is a key health behavior for persons with
type 2 diabetes.11,12
Our findings are also consistent with those of 2 pre-
vious studies conducted among younger and healthier
populations with diabetes.13,14 Among middle-aged (mean
age, 50 years) men with type 2 diabetes in the Aerobics
Center Longitudinal Study, physical activity was associ-
ated with reduced all-cause mortality.13 In the Nurses'
Health Study, moderate and vigorous physical activity
were associated with reduced rates of overall cardiovas-
cular events, coronary heart disease events, and ische-
mic strokes among diabetic women aged 30 to 55 years
who were free of CVD at baseline.14 Our study comple-
ments these earlier studies by examining a nationally rep-
resentative sample that was probably more diverse and
had more comorbid conditions typical of diabetic per-
sons. This diversity enhances the validity when making
inferences to the overall diabetic population.
Persons with diabetes have a high prevalence of
microvascular and macrovascular diseases25 and func-
tional limitations26 that could make exercise more dif-
ficult. The complications of diabetes could also con-
ceivably increase their risk for CVD events, falls,
injuries, or foot ulcers.27-29 Thus, health care providers
may be reluctant to encourage physical activity. How-
ever, our results suggest that the effects of walking on
longevity extend across these diverse characteristics,
with roughly equal benefit regardless of age, sex, race,
BMI, time since diabetes diagnosis, or presence of
comorbid conditions and functional limitations.
Walking could lengthen the life of people with dia-
betes in several ways. Among people without diabetes,
physical activity has been related to increased high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels,30,31 decreased
blood pressure,32 decreased insulin levels,33 increased
cardiorespiratory fitness,34 and if accompanied by
weight loss, decreased low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol levels.30,31 Among diabetic persons, regular exer-
cise is also associated with improved insulin sensitivity
and glycemic control.10 These effects could help reduce
the incidence of cardiovascular events and/or reduce
mortality among those who already have cardiovascular
disease.35 Finally, in the presence of multiple chronic
diseases, exercise may forestall functional decline36,37
and may delay death through other unexplained
mechanisms.
We found the lowest mortality rates among per-
sons reporting moderate increases in perceived heart
and breathing rates, but we found no mortality reduc-
tion associated with large perceived increases in heart
and breathing rates. One might conclude from this lat-
ter observation that more intense levels of walking are
not as beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes. How-
ever, a large perceived increase in heart rate or breath-
ing rate during walking might be a marker of exertional
coronary ischemia or other undetected cardiovascular
or pulmonary disease.2 If true, higher mortality rates
among people with large perceived increases in heart
rate/breathing rate could have been due to underlying
disease rather than the intensity of exercise performed.
This explanation is consistent with our finding that the
amount of risk reduction associated with large per-
ceived increases in heart rate or breathing rate was simi-
lar to those with small or moderate increases when we
excluded deaths that occurred during the first 2 years of
follow-up.
Our study has several limitations. Participants' dia-
betes status was based on self-reports, which are highly
sensitive and specific for previously diagnosed diabetes,
but clearly miss individuals with undiagnosed diabe-
tes.38 Thus, we may not be able to generalize our find-
ings to those with undiagnosed diabetes. In addition, we
had inadequate power to examine associations among per-
sons who were more likely to have type 1 diabetes, and
the long-term effects of physical activity among that sub-
group remains unclear.
Our analyses focused on walking because it is the
most commonly performed and one of the safest forms
of physical activity. However, we cannot generalize our
findings to other specific activities or to physical activi-
ties not included in the NHIS surveys (eg, household,
transportation, and work-related physical activities).
Also, because physical activity was measured by means
of self-report during a 2-week time frame, it may not be
representative of usual activity for all persons. However,
physical activity surveys with a similar format and time
frame have been shown to have high test-retest reliabil-
ity and moderate correlations with energy expenditure

participant characteristics. The analyses were controlled for age, sex, race,
body mass index, self-rated health, smoking, weight loss approaches,
hospitalizations, hypertension and the use of antihypertensive medications,
physician visits, limitations caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
cancer, and level of functional limitation. Examination within duration of
disease strata additionally controlled for insulin use. Comorbid conditions
are defined as any functional limitations associated with CVD or cancer or a
history of hospitalization during past year; limitation, as any self-reported
limitation in major activity. DM indicates diabetes mellitus.

using the doubly labeled water technique and to be pre-
dictive of CVD and mortality in the general popula-
tion.21 The reliability and validity of self-reported exer-
cise intensity assessed in epidemiological studies is less
clear. However, breathing and heart rate responses have
been shown to be central cues to perceived exertion,
which are highly correlated with actual workload in
experimental settings.39 We also lacked detailed infor-
mation on dietary composition, which may be associ-
ated with physical activity and could similarly reduce
mortality. However, our findings were not changed
when we controlled for whether persons were trying to
reduce calories or were enrolled in special programs to
lose weight.
Finally, we cannot rule out underlying health status
as one of the factors explaining why physical activity
was associated with decreased mortality risk. Sicker per-
sons may have chosen not to be physically active
because of chronic conditions or subclinical disease not
measured by this study. However, we found that people
reporting higher levels of walking at baseline actually
had nonsignificantly higher levels of stroke, heart dis-
ease, and hospitalization at baseline than those reporting
no walking. In addition, our analyses controlled for
variation in utilization of health care services, self-rated
health, and functional limitations associated with
chronic conditions, and our findings were essentially
unchanged when we conducted analyses among a sub-
sample who had been asked specifically about heart dis-
ease and stroke.
Many important questions remain about the ef-
fects of physical activity on the long-term disease out-
comes of people with diabetes. Although physical activ-
ity leads to numerous physiological benefits, and although
our findings suggest that walking increases longevity
among patients with diabetes, the direct relationships be-
tween physical activity and the incidence of microvas-
cular and macrovascular complications, disability inci-
dence, or quality of life among persons with diabetes have
not been established. We lack data on adverse events that
could conceivably result from physical activity, includ-
ing hypoglycemia, foot ulcers, falls, and sudden cardiac
death. We also lack the data needed to assess the inter-
vening roles of factors such as glycemic control, weight
loss, control of CVD risk factors, and specific incident
events such as heart attack and stroke. Thus, it is impor-
tant for future studies to clearly determine the mecha-
nisms whereby walking and physical activity reduce mor-
tality risk, and conduct randomized controlled trials to
test the effects of specific types and amounts of physical
activity on long-term health outcomes.
The prevalence of diabetes and physical inactivity
are both high in the United States.40,41 Our findings that
regular walking is likely to increase longevity across a
diverse spectrum of adults with diabetes means that suc-
cessful efforts to increase physical activity levels of the
US diabetic population could have broad public health
benefits. To be successful, however, such efforts may de-
pend on a combination of approaches, including com-
munity-based programs, effective health promotion
through the health care system, and environmental and
cultural changes.
