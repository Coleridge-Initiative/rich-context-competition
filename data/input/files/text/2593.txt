Social Disadvantage and Network Turnover

Department of Sociology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.
Objectives.Research shows that socially disadvantaged groups--especially African Americans and people of low
socioeconomic status (SES)--experience more unstable social environments. I argue that this causes higher rates of
turnover within their personal social networks. This is a particularly important issue among disadvantaged older adults,
who may benefit from stable networks. This article, therefore, examines whether social disadvantage is related to various
aspects of personal network change.
Method. Social network change was assessed using longitudinal egocentric network data from the National Social
Life, Health, and Aging Project, a study of older adults conducted between 2005 and 2011. Data collection in Wave 2
included a technique for comparing respondents' confidant network rosters between waves. Rates of network losses,
deaths, and additions were modeled using multivariate Poisson regression.
Results. African Americans and low-SES individuals lost more confidants--especially due to death--than did whites
and college-educated respondents. African Americans also added more confidants than whites. However, neither African
Americans nor low-SES individuals were able to match confidant losses with new additions to the extent that others did,
resulting in higher levels of confidant network shrinkage. These trends are partly, but not entirely, explained by disadvan-
taged individuals' poorer health and their greater risk of widowhood or marital dissolution.
Discussion. Additional work is needed to shed light on the role played by race- and class-based segregation on group
differences in social network turnover. Social gerontologists should examine the role these differences play in explaining
the link between social disadvantage and important outcomes in later life, such as health decline.
Key Words: Aging--Bereavement--Network change--Race--Social inequality--Social networks.
One of the most enduring lessons to emerge from social
science research over the past few decades is that the
social networks in which people are embedded--through
friendship, support, exchange, conflict, kinship, and other
types of relationships (Wasserman & Faust, 1994)--are
profoundly consequential for individuals. Social networks
shape their access to resources, exposure to social influ-
ence and control, perceptions, attitudes, opportunities, and
power, among other things (Wellman, 1983). Social net-
works are, therefore, implicated in a wide variety of out-
comes, ranging from access to resources and social support
to health-related behaviors, delinquency, and mortality (e.g.,
Cornwell & Waite, 2009; Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton,
2010; Smith & Christakis, 2008; Stephens, Alpass, Towers,
& Stevenson, 2011; Wellman & Wortley, 1990). But just as
researchers have made tremendous gains in pinpointing the
elements of social networks that drive these effects (e.g.,
network size and network members' attributes), they have
also come to realize that these elements are highly dynamic
and prone to change. As such, the focus has begun to shift
toward the problem of understanding the nature, conse-
quences, and causes of social network change (see Snijders
& Doreian, 2010; Wellman, Wong, Tindall, & Nazer, 1997).
This article represents an attempt to understand some of the
causes of change within individuals' personal networks,
specifically as it unfolds within the context of later life.
First, consider the nature and potential consequences of
network change. Personal network change involves several
unique processes, including the loss and addition of close
contacts, network turnover, as well as subtler shifts in the
configuration of social resources, influences, and relation-
ships within an individual's network. These processes are
known to affect important individual outcomes such as
health and mortality (Eng, Rimm, Fitzmaurice, & Kawachi,
2002; Giordano & Lindstrom, 2010; Holtzman et al., 2004;
Kroenke, Kubzansky, Adler, & Kawachi, 2008; Seeman
et al., 2011; Thomas, 2012). The implications of network
change, however, depend on several factors. These include
the nature of the social ties involved in the change in ques-
tion (e.g., whether they are weak or strong, supportive or
harmful) and whether change was purposeful and antici-
pated. For instance, losing or gaining close contacts may
result in an unintended reshuffling of the social influences
and norms that constitute one's social environment. This
can give rise to a sense of normlessness or detachment from
society (Deflem, 1989), reduced capacity to locate specific
forms of support within one's network (Pescosolido, 1992),
and disruption to preexisting routines and systems of coor-
dination (Cornwell & Laumann, in press). Undesired net-
work losses that are beyond one's control can also reduce
one's sense of control and coping capacity (Gerstorf,
Röcke, & Lachman, 2011)--especially when this involves
132
Social Disadvantage and Network Turnover
an irreversible loss, such as the death of a friend. The analy-
sis below will address these types of losses explicitly.
At the same time, individuals often purposefully cut ties
with close network members and/or cultivate ties with new
ones, perhaps in an effort to achieve a more emotionally
close set of contacts (Charles & Carstensen, 2010) or a
more strategically advantageous one (Burt, 2005). Making
new friends, for example, can increase the number, range,
and quality of social resources that are available to a person.
In short, the consequences of change within an individual's
personal network are likely contingent on the nature of
the ties involved and how those changes come about. This
possibility makes it especially important to understand the
determinants of network change, particularly those factors
that reduce individuals' control over such change.
The Relevance of Social Disadvantage
Several theoretical frameworks suggest that social dis-
advantage is one factor that greatly affects the extent to
which, and why, individuals' personal networks change.
Sociological perspectives suggest that the social environ-
mentsofdisadvantagedgroups--especially racialminorities
and low­socioeconomic status (SES) individuals--are less
stable than the environments of more advantaged groups.
Persistent social disorder, greater prevalence of unemploy-
ment and contingent work, residential instability (e.g., due
to evictions), poverty, and high incarceration rates com-
bine to create unusually high levels of instability within
the social environments (i.e., neighborhoods and house-
holds) within which disadvantaged groups are concentrated
(Atkinson, Liem, & Liem, 1986; Cattell, 2001; Cornwell,
2014; Desmond, 2012a; Kasarda & Janowitz, 1974; Rose
& Clear, 1998; Small, 2007; van Eijk, 2010; Wellman et al.,
1997). This, in turn, can create distrust, uncertainty, asyn-
chrony, and a lack of cooperation in disadvantaged indi-
viduals' personal networks (Goffman, 2009; Miller-Cribbs
& Farber, 2008; Smith, 2007). Indeed, research suggests
that environmental instability can yield circumstances in
which one's network ties are rendered temporary, "dispos-
able," and substitutable (Desmond, 2012b). Though this is
debatable, some research also implies that this results in
smaller or more restricted personal networks within disad-
vantaged social strata--including in later life (see Ajrouch,
Antonucci, & Janevic, 2001; Peek & O'Neill, 2001).
This circumstance suggests that some groups--especially
African Americans and those with few material resources--
experience turnover within their personal networks in a
manner that mirrors the instability of the broader social envi-
ronments in which they live. This research implies not only
that disadvantaged groups experience higher rates of loss
from the ranks of their personal social networks but also that
they have greater difficulty recovering from and adapting to
those losses. One reason this is such an important issue is
that socially disadvantaged people--especially the urban
poor--must rely disproportionately on network members
(especially kin) for social support and for indirect access to
resources to survive (e.g., Cantor, 1979; Small, 2009).
Network Change, Social Disadvantage, and Aging
Age is also an important determinant of personal net-
work change. Social gerontologists have long been con-
cerned about the implications of aging for social integration
(e.g., Cumming & Henry, 1961), for later life is a time
when the need for social support increases and when pri-
mary network ties are a key source of sense of belonging.
Life-course transitions like retirement, widowhood, health
decline, and residential changes can drastically alter a per-
son's network (Cornwell, 2009; Perry & Pescosolido, 2012;
Schafer, 2013). Accordingly, social gerontologists have
become increasingly interested in examining the nature
and implications of change in individuals' social networks
(Shaw, Krause, Liang, & Bennett, 2007; van Tilburg, 1998;
Wrzus, Hänel, Wagner, & Neyer, 2013). Much research has
focused on how bereavement affects social engagement
(e.g., Donnelly & Hinterlong, 2010), and there is increas-
ing interest in how health problems affect older adults'
efforts to form and maintain social ties (e.g., Cornwell,
2009; Schafer, 2013). At the same time, network changes
that occur in late life are often purposeful, perhaps moti-
vated by a sense of a dwindling life span and the desire to
cut ties with weaker contacts and to spend more time with
loved ones (Charles & Carstensen, 2010), to be more auton-
omous (Marcum, 2013), or to achieve independence from
abusive, exploitative, or otherwise stifling relationships
(e.g., Cornwell, 2011; Pillemer, & Suitor, 1992). Moreover,
continuity, activity, and adaptation theories argue that peo-
ple grow accustomed to certain social roles and activities
during their lives and often attempt to maintain their roles,
or develop substitutes, through later-life transitions (e.g.,
Atchley, 1989; Donnelly & Hinterlong, 2010; Heckhausen,
2006). The loss of social ties associated with life-course
transitions, therefore, often sparks efforts to adapt to and/
or compensate by developing new ties (Bloem, van Tilburg,
& Thomése, 2008; Cornwell & Laumann, in press; Lamme,
Dykstra, & van Groenou, 1996; Zettel & Rook, 2004).
Network-oriented social-gerontological research usually
treats these kinds of later-life transitions as challenges to
general social network connectedness--developments that
can threaten the stability of one's personal network. One of
the primary concerns that motivates this article is that such
developments may be even more salient for aging minorities
and members of lower socioeconomic strata. It is possible
that the transitions of later life compound socially disadvan-
taged groups' already problematic experiences with personal
network change in part because their transitions, and those
of their social contacts, are especially trying (e.g., see Shaw
et al., 2007). In addition (and related) to the aspects of social
disorganization discussed earlier, members of socially dis-
advantaged groups suffer from more health problems, worse
133
Cornwell
health care, and higher mortality rates (Adler & Rehkopf,
2008; Kawachi, Kennedy, Lochner, & Prothrow-Stith, 1997;
Link & Phelan, 1995; Williams & Collins, 1995). By impli-
cation, they also experience bereavement more frequently
due to the health-related incapacitation, institutionalization,
or death of network members (e.g., Hawkins & Abrams,
2007). Indeed, the congruence of environmental instabil-
ity associated with social disadvantage and the challenges
that accompany later life may contribute to a form of "dou-
ble jeopardy" among older minorities (e.g., see Carreon &
Noymer, 2011), producing a situation that exacerbates pre-
existing health-related and other forms of inequality within
aging cohorts (see also Dannefer, 1987, 2003).
Accordingly, adaptation and compensation efforts may
be a bigger part of socially disadvantaged older adults' eve-
ryday lives. This could mean that they experience higher
rates of both network loss and network growth, producing
a cycle of chronic network turnover, or "churn," that ampli-
fies preexisting instability within their social environments.
This picture of constant adaptation is complicated, however,
by the fact that older disadvantaged adults are particularly
short on the resources and opportunities needed to continu-
ally replenish their personal social networks. That is, to the
extent that they experience a concurrence of greater health
problems and more unstable environments, socially disad-
vantaged older adults may have greater difficulty than both
other older adults and younger disadvantaged individuals
in adapting to and compensating for unwanted changes in
their personal social networks.
Method
I explore these ideas using data from two waves of the
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP),
a nationally representative, population-based panel study
funded by the National Institutes of Health. The NSHAP
focuses on understanding connections between older
adults' social lives and health. Wave 1 (W1) was conducted
in 2005­2006 and consisted of in-home interviews with
3,005 community-dwelling older adults between the ages
of 57 and 85. The sample was selected using a multistage
area probability design that oversampled by race/ethnicity,
age, and gender. The final response rate for W1 was 75.5%.
In 2010­2011, the NSHAP conducted a second wave (W2).
Of the baseline respondents, 744 (24.8%) were lost to
some form of attrition. NSHAP's W2 response rate from
among eligible surviving baseline respondents (N = 2,548)
is 88.7%. In all, the NSHAP reinterviewed 75.2% of W1
respondents, yielding a panel of 2,261 older adults.
This analysis focuses on changes that occurred within
respondents' personal ("egocentric") social networks dur-
ing this study period. Starting at W1, all respondents were
asked to list up to five people with whom they discuss
"things that were important to you" during the past year
(i.e., "confidants"). This procedure tends to elicit strong
ties--ties through which social influence and resources
are most likely to flow (see Bailey & Marsden, 1999;
Cornwell, Laumann, & Schumm, 2008). To assess network
change, the NSHAP collected respondents' confidant ros-
ters at both waves. Not only were the same network data
collected at W2 as at W1 but the NSHAP also devised a
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) exercise
at W2 to reveal specific confidant changes between waves
among the respondents who participated in both waves. At
W2, interviewers first collected each respondent's confi-
dant roster and preliminary information about respondents'
relationships with confidants. The respondent's W1 roster
was preloaded into the CAPI instrument and was not vis-
ible to the respondent while completing this step. After the
respondent completed the W2 roster, the CAPI was pro-
grammed to display a visual representation linking matches
between the W1 and W2 rosters (Figure 1). The respondent
was asked to verify if these computer-programmed matches
were correct and was given the opportunity to correct any
mismatches. The W1 roster line corresponding to the same
W2 confidant was then recorded where applicable.
First, I calculate the number of confidants who were
named at W1 but who were not named as confidants again
at W2 (confidants "lost"). Second, I calculate the number
of confidants who were named at W2 but who had not
been named as such at W1 (confidants "added"). I measure
overall net change in network size between waves by sub-
tracting W1 network size from W2 network size ("overall
change"). Finally, as an adjunct to the analysis of network
loss, I calculate the number of W1 confidants who died
between waves.
Multivariate Poisson regression analyses are used to pre-
dict the number of confidants lost from these respondents'
Figure 1. Sample screenshot of the CAPI interface used by a hypothetical National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project respondent to match her W1 network
members to her W2 network members.
134
Social Disadvantage and Network Turnover
networks, the number who died, the number of who were
lost due to reasons other than death, and the number of new
network members added. Poisson is appropriate because
these four variables are count models, and there is little
evidence of overdispersion (the variances of these counts
are about the same as their means). The number of network
members at baseline was included as the exposure vari-
able, which effectively controls for network size effects.
Multivariate OLS regression is used to predict overall net
change in the size of respondents' networks during the
study period. Baseline network size is controlled when pre-
dicting this outcome as well.
The models proceed first by regressing each of the
dependent variables on a set of sociodemographic predic-
tors, including age (which is divided by 10 to provide more
meaningful coefficients), gender (male/female), race/eth-
nicity (white, African American, Latino, and other), and
SES (high school education or less, some college, or col-
lege/professional degree). (SES can also be measured using
ordinal information about respondents' estimated assets.
Unfortunately, this information is missing for nearly 15%
of the baseline NSHAP sample. Supplemental analyses that
measure SES using assets as a predictor reveal a similar pat-
tern of results as those regarding education, with the excep-
tion of nonsignificant findings in the analysis of aggregate
network change. Results are available upon request.) These
initial models provide information about whether aspects
of race and/or SES significantly predict measures of net-
work change. Note that the first models for each dependent
variable also control for respondents' average frequency of
contact with and closeness to their W1 confidants, the kin
composition of their W1 networks, and their frequency of
attendance at religious services. These baseline character-
istics help to capture the structural features of social net-
works and community involvement that affect the stability
of one's network and opportunities to maintain and develop
new ties. Table 1 provides detailed descriptions of variable
construction, means/proportions, and standard deviations.

For each dependent variable, a second set of models
include a set of life-course-related measures that cap-
ture later-life transitions that may be related to network
change. Life-course factors include baseline marital sta-
tus and change in marital status between waves, as well
as baseline employment status and change in employment
status (Table 1). These models also include measures of
functional health, self-reported health, and depression. To
measure functional impairment, I use an index comprised
of seven items ( = .84) that assesses how much difficulty
respondents have with everyday tasks (e.g., walking). Self-
rated health is reported by respondents as "poor," "fair,"
"good," "very good," or "excellent." Depressive symptoms
are measured using a modified Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression scale (CES-D-ml), which is the aver-
age of standardized responses to 10 ordinal items assess-
ing depressive symptomology ( = .77). The CES-D-ml
scale does not include one measure typically included in
the CES-D, which asks respondents how often they feel
"lonely," which helps to avoid endogeneity (Cornwell &
Waite, 2009).
Residential mobility is important to consider in any study
of network change. The NSHAP included a leave-behind
questionnaire (LBQ) that respondents could complete and
mail in later. On this, respondents reported how long they
had lived at their current residence. I use this to create an
indicator of whether respondents moved during the past
5 years. Unfortunately, 286 respondents did not complete
the LBQ and 69 others did not respond to the residence
question, creating additional selection issues. Therefore,
I use the residential mobility indicator only in a set of sup-
plemental analyses (Supplementary Table A1).
All models take into account the clustering and stratifi-
cation of NSHAP's sample and include weights to account
for respondents' differential probabilities of selection at W1.
I also take into account the nonrandom loss of respondents
due to attrition between waves. I begin by creating a variable
for each of the 3,005 W1 respondents that indicates whether
they were part of the final W2 sample and in the final model
for a given dependent variable. I predict this indicator using
a logit model, with baseline sociodemographic variables,
health, and other factors entered as predictors. From this,
I derive a predicted probability that each W1 respondent
appears in the analysis. I take the inverse of this probabil-
ity and multiply it by the NSHAP-supplied weight for that
person at W1. Using these adjusted weights as the sampling
weights in the models give more weight to individuals who
were less likely to be in the W2 sample, effectively adjusting
estimates toward where they would have been had all W1
respondents made it into the W2 sample (see Austin, 2011).
Results
The data reveal considerable change within these older
adults' confidant networks over the 5-year study period.
Of the 2,126 respondents who provided valid data, only
7.2% reported a completely stable confidant network that
involved neither losses nor additions. In general, respond-
ents were more likely to add confidants than to lose them.
Fully 81.6% of the sample added at least one new confidant
between waves, whereas 73.5% lost at least one confidant.
The average number of confidants lost between waves was
1.48 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.40, 1.57), and
the average number added was 1.90 (95% CI: 1.83, 1.97).
Just over one fifth of respondents (21.9%) experienced the
death of at least one confidant. All told, most older adults'
networks grew between waves, with an average net change
in network size of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.26).
Race/Ethnicity
Race/ethnicity plays an important role in several aspects
of change within these older adults' personal networks.
Descriptively speaking, African Americans experienced
more change than other groups. White respondents were
91.4% more likely than African Americans, and Latinos
were 110.9% more likely than African Americans, to
maintain the same exact confidant network over the 5-year
period (Supplementary Figure A1). Whereas 7.6% of white
respondents and 8.3% of Latinos reported neither losing
W1 confidants nor adding new confidants at W2, only 4.0%
of African American respondents did. Likewise, African
American respondents were 10.8% more likely to experi-
ence turnover that involved both multiple confidants lost
and multiple confidants gained than whites and 66.7%
more likely than Latinos, with 44.1% of African Americans
experiencing this level of turnover compared with 39.8% of
whites and 26.4% of Latinos.
These patterns are also evident in the multivariate analy-
sis. As shown in the first column of regression coefficients
in Table 2, African Americans experienced a 22.0% higher
rate of loss from their confidant networks than whites over
the study period (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.220, stand-
ard error [SE] = 0.052). This coefficient is reduced slightly
but remains significant at p < .05 when life-course factors
such as retirement, widowhood, and health are taken into
account. These patterns reflect both losses due to the deaths
of confidants and losses due to other reasons, such as resi-
dential mobility and job changes. That African Americans
expensed a significantly higher rate of nondeath-related
confidant losses is shown in the third and fourth columns of
regression coefficients. But perhaps even more importantly,
African Americans reported a significantly higher confidant
mortality rate (IRR = 1.321, SE = 0.156). This difference
remains marginally significant (p < .07) even after life-
course (e.g., widowhood) and health covariates are taken
into account.
Note that Latinos report only about half the rate of con-
fidant mortality as whites (IRR = 0.549, SE = 0.136), a
difference that remains when other factors are controlled.
This is the only significant association between Latino race/

ethnicity and network change. These associations are simi-
lar (but stronger) in the supplemental analysis that includes
information about residential mobility (Supplementary
Table A1).
An important analytic issue is that these models suffer
from endogeneity due to the fact that death is present on
both sides of the equation for respondents who named their
spouses as confidants at W1 and who became widowed
between waves. A supplemental analysis (available upon
request) shows that even among those who did not become
widowed between waves, African Americans suffered
significantly higher rates of confidant death than whites
(IRR = 1.561, SE = 0.227) and Latinos experienced lower
rates of confidant death (IRR = 0.448, SE = 0.105).
African Americans also report adding more new confi-
dants than whites (IRR = 1.079, SE = 0.035). This associa-
tion is reduced to nonsignificance and becomes marginally
smaller (adjusted Wald F = 3.13, p < .08) when life-course
factors are included. OLS regression analyses show that, in
the end, African Americans experienced larger net losses in
the sizes of their confidant networks than whites (b = -0.297,
SE = 0.101), a difference that remains significant even
after controlling for other covariates. This association is
reinforced by the supplemental analysis that controls for
residential mobility (Supplementary Table A1). The over-
all change in network size measure is difficult to interpret,
however, as it is difficult to determine whether networks are
actually growing or shrinking. A supplemental multinomial
logit model that predict three possible trajectories of overall
network change (shrinkage, stability, or growth) show that
African Americans have about 73% greater risk than whites
of experiencing network shrinkage as opposed to network
stability (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.730, SE = 0.312), but
there is no significant difference in their relative risk of net-
work growth (RRR = 0.860, SE = 0.224).
Socioeconomic Status
Socioeconomic status is also associated with confidant net-
work turnover. The main significant difference with respect to
education appears in the analysis of network loss. As shown
in Table 2, those who had nothing beyond a high school edu-
cation lost their confidants at a 14.1% greater rate than those
who earned college degrees (IRR = 1.141, SE = 0.057). This
association becomes nonsignificant when life-course and
health measures are taken into account. Although not one set
of these measures accounts for the reduction in the associa-
tion, the health measures alone reduce the association to non-
significance and also significantly reduces the magnitude of
the association (adjusted Wald F = 7.56, p < .01). There are
no statistically significant differences between those who had
some college but did not earn a degree and those who went
on to earn a college degree.
There is a strong association between education and
confidant mortality. The least-educated group experienced

Social Disadvantage and Network Turnover
a 38.1% greater confidant mortality rate than those who
earned college degrees (IRR = 1.381, SE = 0.185). It is
worth noting that this association is explained by the mari-
tal status/transition measures. This is mainly attributable
to the fact that less-educated individuals were more likely
to become widowed during the study period. (However,
a supplemental analysis, which is available upon request,
shows that even among those who did not become widowed
between waves, low-SES individuals experienced margin-
ally higher rates of confidant death [IRR = 1.308, p =. 08].)
Controlling for the health measures without controlling for
life-course transitions also reduces the association with
marginal significance. Supplemental analyses that take into
account residential mobility (Supplementary Table A1)
echo these findings.
Levels of formal education are not significantly asso-
ciated with the addition of new confidants over the study
period. The OLS regression analyses predicting overall net-
work change show that, in the end, those with only a high
school (or less) education had significantly more overall
negative change in the sizes of their confidant networks than
those who had a college degree (b = -0.215, SE = 0.093).
This net difference in network size change remains nearly
significant (p = .05) despite controlling for other covariates
(b = -0.177, SE = 0.088). Note that the analysis shown in
Supplementary Table A1 provides some evidence that those
who had some college experienced more network growth
than those who had a college degree. Additional analyses
(not shown) suggest that finding is an artifact of the fact
that less-educated people lost a greater proportion of their
Wave 1 confidants, which left them more room in the roster
to add confidants.
Stratified Network Loss
Although the earlier analyses provide some clues as to
group differences in confidant network change, they are
not definitive accounts of different groups' experiences
with network instability. Nonetheless, there are system-
atic differences in different groups' reports of why their
confidant networks changed. Unfortunately, the NSHAP
did not inquire about how new confidant relationships were
developed. But the team did inquire about "lost" network
members. For any W1 confidant who was not named again
at W2, respondents reported whether that person was still
alive and, if so, why the relationship ended. Based on cod-
ing of these brief responses, the NSHAP team devised
several broad classes of network loss. Key categories are
presented in Table 3.
Based on an analysis of the 1,551 individuals who expe-
rienced the loss of at least one confidant and who provided
valid information about these losses, Table 3 shows some
significant differences in causes of network loss. Perhaps the
most important finding echoes the multivariate results just
discussed--that African Americans were more likely than
members of other race/ethnic groups to experience the death
of a confidant. Specifically, 34.9% of African Americans
who lost a confidant lost one due to death, compared with
30.6% of whites, 14.4% of Latinos, and 12.2% of mem-
bers of other races. Although African Americans were more
likely than whites to experience the loss of confidants due to
residential mobility or some other distance issue (36.9% vs.
31.5%, respectively), Latinos (57.5%) and members of other
race groups (51.7%) were more likely to experience loss due
to this. With respect to SES, the biggest difference between
groups is that more highly educated respondents were most
likely to lose a confidant due to a job-related change, as
opposed to some other cause such as death.
Conclusion
Motivated by the dual observations that social network
change is pervasive and consequential in later life (Cornwell
& Laumann, in press; Eng et al., 2002; Holtzman et al.,
2004) and that members of socially disadvantaged groups
face more instability in general in their everyday social
environments (Ajrouch et al., 2001; Hawkins & Abrams,
2007; Peek & O'Neill, 2001; Shaw et al., 2007), this study
has sought to assess the link between social disadvantage
and personal network change. Members of disadvantaged

groups indeed experience disproportionate amounts of
change in their personal social networks in later life.
Namely, African Americans and less-educated individuals
lost more of their confidants over a 5-year period--espe-
cially due to death--than did whites and those who had col-
lege degrees, respectively. Interestingly, African Americans
added network members at a greater rate than whites. Yet,
neither African Americans nor low-SES individuals were
able to match their substantial network losses with equal
numbers of new additions to the same extent as others did,
ultimately resulting in more network shrinkage and less net-
work growth than was observed in other groups.
Thus, it appears that disadvantaged older adults have
both a greater need to replace losses to their social net-
works that are associated with later-life transitions and
greater difficulty in doing so. Indeed, these associations are
partly due to socially disadvantaged groups' worse health
and greater likelihood of transitioning out of marriage--
either due to divorce or widowhood. This finding highlights
one way in which disadvantage accumulates in later life
and how personal social networks are implicated in that
process (see Dannefer, 2003). Unfortunately, significant
differences between these groups with respect to rates of
confidant network turnover remain unexplained. Additional
work is needed to understand how processes of adaptation
and compensation in late life (e.g., Atchley, 1989; Bloem
et al., 2008; Heckhausen, 2006; Lamme et al., 1996; Zettel
& Rook, 2004) are experienced by especially disadvantaged
groups, such as impoverished African Americans.
A particularly disturbing finding is the strong associations
between social disadvantage and confidant mortality. The
greater propensity for less-educated individuals to experi-
ence this is partly but not entirely a reflection of their higher
rates of widowhood. For one, variation in physical and men-
tal well-being helps to explain the association between both
education and race and confidant mortality. Furthermore,
even those who did not become widowed experienced
higher rates of confidant mortality than their more socially
advantaged counterparts. These findings likely reflect the
influence of network homophily (McPherson, Smith-Lovin,
& Cook, 2001). We know that people disproportionately
form network ties with others of similar race/ethnicity and
SES, so the confidants of disadvantaged individuals (who
are themselves less healthy) are also at greater risk of mor-
tality. It is also possible that health-related homophily (see
Flatt, Agimi, & Albert, 2012; Schaefer, Kornienko, & Fox,
2011) shapes older adults' closest network connections.
Regardless of the mechanism, these patterns reflect the seg-
regation of disadvantaged groups into social environments
that are inherently less stable (e.g., see Desmond, 2012b)
and that are largely disconnected from the networks of more
advantaged social groups. Socially disadvantaged people
are disproportionally connected to more vulnerable confi-
dants, which in turn means that there is premature depletion
of disadvantaged older adults' stock of healthy (potential)
close social contacts, combined with limited capacity to
cultivate new (healthy) ties. This has serious implications
for these individuals' abilities to access social support and
other resources in the face of already difficult later-life chal-
lenges like widowhood and health decline.
When combined with mounting evidence that socially
disadvantaged groups have less access to valuable forms
of social capital (see Lin, 2000; McDonald, Lin, & Ao,
2009)--including in later life (Ajrouch et al., 2001)--the
fact that the personal networks these groups do have are
less stable suggests a precarious situation for aging African
Americans and low-SES individuals. In light of the fact that
social disadvantage is associated with less social capital (at
the neighborhood level as well), which in turn is associated
with higher rates of health problems and mortality (e.g.,
see Cattell, 2001; Kawachi et al., 1997; Mendes de Leon
& Glass, 2004), social gerontologists should examine the
possibility that social network instability is a mechanism
by which race- and SES-based health disparities develop
and widen. The fact that Latinos reported the lowest levels
of network loss of any group in this sample provides addi-
tional impetus for this research direction, given ongoing
attempts to understand the "Latino paradox" in health and
mortality (Borrell & Lancet, 2012).
Finally, these findings add a twist to the debate over
whether (older) individuals' social networks are, on the
whole, shrinking. McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears
(2006) have argued that people's confidant networks are
growing smaller. Likewise, some social gerontologists have
argued that older adults' networks usually shrink, as they
come to favor closer ties (see Charles & Carstensen, 2010)
and have less incidental social contact (Marcum, 2013). My
findings challenge these ideas in principle, as they show that
older adults' personal networks are actually more likely to
grow in size than to decline overall (see also Fischer, 2009;
Paik & Sanchagrin, 2013). This may be because, even though
later life is period of loss and transition, older adults are
adaptive and compensate for such losses (e.g., Bloem et al.,
2008; Donnelly & Hinterlong, 2010) and may be inclined
to socialize even more beyond this. What the findings pre-
sented here suggest is that the narrative of general network
decline and later-life network shrinkage may be more valid
for socially disadvantaged groups, who are likely less able to
adapt to and compensate for network losses.
