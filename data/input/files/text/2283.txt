The principal focus of global public health efforts over the past
several decades has been on improving child health and
survival, and there is no question that continued investment in
child health care provision and community development should
remain a priority. Each year, an estimated 10.9 million children
die before the age of 5 years, the vast majority of them from
diarrhoeal disease, pneumonia, perinatal causes, malaria, and
measles.1 Much of this is preventable, through intervention
programmes focused on major childhood diseases. These have
proved remarkably successful, at least for some diseases
(particularly measles), over the past couple of decades. Global
child mortality has declined from an estimated 14.6 million in
19852 to less than 11 million currently, although the progress
has been uneven in different populations, with only marginal
declines in child mortality in Africa (10­20% since 1980)
compared with elsewhere.3
Part of the success in reducing child mortality must surely lie
with the increased efforts to monitor child mortality levels over
the past few decades through systematic application of direct
and indirect methods to data on survival of children routinely
collected in censuses and surveys. Several methodological
advances now allow the indirect assessment of child mortality
from direct evidence on children ever born and children
surviving.4,5 The wealth of data on child mortality (defined as
the risk of death between birth and age 5) for the four largest
developing countries (India, China, Brazil, and Indonesia) is
shown in Figure 1. From these rich data sources, it is possible to
establish current levels of child mortality with reasonable
certainty.

REVIEW
Adult mortality: time for a reappraisal
Emmanuela Gakidou,1 Margaret Hogan1 and Alan D Lopez2
Accepted 19 December 2003
Background In many countries, little is known about adult mortality rates. New innovations
are necessary to develop reasonable estimates from available information. One
readily available resource is household survey data. While birth histories
collected in surveys have produced reasonable estimates of child mortality, the
use of sibling survival data collected in similar household surveys has not been
comprehensively analysed, largely because of concerns of underreporting.
Methods This paper uses sibling survival schedules from 29 Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS) to generate estimates of under-5 mortality and of the summary measure
of adult mortality 45q15--the probability of dying between ages 15 and 59. These
are then compared with UN child and adult mortality estimates.
Results Sibling history data collected in these household surveys seems to contain
adequate information to estimate adult mortality rates, though there are
problems with underreporting. The correlation coefficient between UN estimates
and DHS estimates is 0.74 for adult mortality, indicating a strong relationship
between the two but suggesting there may be underreporting of adult deaths in
the survey data.
Conclusions Further investigation is necessary to determine the usefulness of household
survey data for the estimation of adult mortality. New survey instruments like
the World Health Survey have incorporated questions to help correct for
underreporting in sibling histories. Further analyses need to be carried out in
countries where vital registration data are also available, to determine how well
household survey data do in estimating adult mortality and whether improve-
ments in the survey instrument adequately correct for underreporting of deaths.

ADULT MORTALITY: TIME FOR A REAPPRAISAL 711
Regrettably, knowledge about levels of adult mortality has
not kept pace with these developments. Health development
policies are, or should be, concerned with improving health and
survival across the lifespan. As this segment of the population
increases, with fewer children dying each year, the concept of
preventing premature death must similarly adapt from a
singular focus on preventing child death to a broader concern
with preventing premature child and adult death. Yet despite
attempts by some authors to stress the need for greater public
health focus on adult health,6,7 it has taken the advent of a
massive new epidemic (human immunodeficiency virus
[HIV]/AIDS) which primarily affects young adults to galvanize
support for adult health as a key international health priority.
The imperative for greater international focus on improving the
health of adults extends well beyond HIV. Recent comparative
analyses of the leading causes of risk factor burden worldwide
identified high blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol among the
top five, along with unsafe sex. Virtually all premature deaths
and disabilities these risk factors cause occur among young and
middle aged adults.8
Yet, despite the large and growing importance of disease and
injury burden among adults, in many countries there remains
vast uncertainty about levels of adult mortality, let alone cause.
The lack of a reliable baseline against which to monitor pro-
gramme effectiveness is a serious impediment to effective public
health action to reduce the main killers of young adults. In this
paper, we outline the current state of knowledge on levels of
adult mortality and propose new methodological approaches
which we believe have the potential to yield plausible adult
mortality rates from routinely collected survey data on sibling
survival.
Main sources of data on adult mortality
Reliable, timely estimates of age-sex-specific death rates remain
the cornerstone of health information systems. Undoubtedly,
Figure 1 Data sources available for child mortality estimation in the four largest developing countries
the most reliable source of data for calculating mortality rates is
a functioning vital registration system which records the fact of
death, as well as the age and sex of the decedent, for all or
almost all deaths. Based on data provided to the WHO each year
by countries, some 74 of the 191 (now 192) Member States in
2000 had what might be termed complete and reliable vital
registration systems in 2000.9 In conjunction with mid-year
population estimates, age-specific death rates for these countries,
covering about one-quarter of the 55.7 million deaths esti-
mated to have occurred in that year, can be readily determined.
WHO has categorized mortality data sources as presented in
Table 1.9
Incomplete vital registration and sentinel
surveillance
In addition to these countries with complete vital registration
systems, virtually all other governments maintain some form of
vital registration of births and deaths, although the coverage
varies greatly across countries. Very few countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa (South Africa is the notable exception) have
estimated coverage levels for vital events of more than 50%,
and most are well below this level. There exist demographic
techniques5,10­12 which allow one to assess the completeness
of registration of adult deaths based on certain assumptions
about the stability of population growth rates and migration.
For a further 46 countries, vital registration is considered
sufficiently complete to permit application of these methods.
The extent of under-registration of deaths varies considerably,
but is typically of the order 20­25% for the Central Asian
Republics, but much lower (5­10%) in countries such as
Guatemala and the Republic of Korea.9 In several large
populations including Brazil and Egypt, vital registration
appears to be performing reasonably satisfactorily, capturing
80­85% of all deaths. These ratios can then be applied to
registered deaths to estimate adult mortality rates, adjusted for
such underreporting.
In some large populations, particularly India and China,
complete or virtually complete vital registration is unlikely to
be a reality for many years. However, for both of these
populations, systems of sentinel surveillance yield remarkably
good estimates of age-specific death rates. In India, the
Sample Vital Registration System (SRS) covers a random sample
of about 6 million people or about 0.6% of the population, and
collects data on vital events in these sample populations. Esti-
mates using the indirect demographic techniques mentioned
above suggest levels of completeness for adult death registra-
tion of about 85%.13 In China, a representative sample of
145 Disease Surveillance Points (DSP) covering villages and
urban districts provides annual mortality data on about
10 million people, with an estimated completeness of coverage
of about 80% (higher in urban areas).9 Systems such as these
are also operating in Bangladesh and Tanzania, and yield reason-
ably reliable information on about 36% of deaths occurring
worldwide.
Regrettably, very little is reliably known about levels of adult
mortality for the remaining 67 Member States of WHO,
comprising 27% of the world's population (by comparison,
there is substantial uncertainty about child mortality in only a
handful of countries, representing about 2% of the world's
population). Data on parental or sibling survival have been
collected in some surveys, but this has not been systematic, nor
have conventional demographic techniques for analysing
survey data on adult mortality generally yielded plausible
results. There thus remains substantial uncertainty about levels
of adult mortality for about half the countries of the world,
either because there is no reliable survey evidence, or because
methods for correcting vital registration data for incompleteness
are essentially subjective, requiring considerable judgement as
to the choice of data points on which to base the assessment.
This uncertainty is appropriately reflected in country and
global estimates of adult mortality. A convenient index for
measuring adult mortality is the probability of dying between
ages 15­60 or 45q15 in life table notation. Levels of risk of adult
death at these ages vary for males from about 10% in Japan,
Australia, and New Zealand to 60% in Southern Africa, where
the HIV epidemic is most pronounced, and from about 5% to
55% for females. Globally, there are an estimated 15.7 million
deaths at ages 15­59, which by any standards must be con-
sidered premature. But perhaps more to the point is the very
substantial uncertainty around these estimates. In Sub-Saharan
Africa, for example, and particularly where mortality rates from
HIV/AIDS are high, there is extraordinary uncertainty about the
true level of adult mortality, often as high as 30­50%.9 This
uncertainty is unacceptable if public health programmes to
control the leading causes of adult death are to be monitored
appropriately. The following section of the paper outlines some
possible methodological approaches to reducing this uncer-
tainty by more reliably correcting for under- and mis-reporting
of deaths.

ADULT MORTALITY: TIME FOR A REAPPRAISAL 713
Estimating adult mortality from
household surveys
Several indirect methods for estimating levels of adult mortality
have been proposed, but it is difficult to validate these methods
because there is little overlap in the types of data available for
countries with good vital registration and those with less
complete systems.14 Indirect methods generally rely on census
and survey data, and include, but are not limited to:
Deaths in the past 12 months
A number of censuses and household surveys include questions
on number of deaths in the household in the 12 or 24 months
prior to the interview. This method often suffers from under-
reporting of events and, when based on household surveys,
does not yield large sample sizes.15,16
The widowhood method
This method estimates mortality rates based on the survival of
a respondent's first husband or wife. Several problems
accompany this method, including the exclusion of younger
and later spouses (particularly in polygamous societies), the
exclusion of unmarried adults,17 the difficulty of clarifying
between ever-widowed and currently widowed,18 the likeli-
hood that in some cases, particularly in high HIV countries, the
mortality of spouses will be related,18 and the necessity of a
large sample size.14,19­21
The orphanhood method
This method estimates mortality rates based on the survival of
a respondent's parents.22 This method has several limitations,
including the underreporting of deaths among parents who died
when their children were quite young (the `adoption' effect),23
and the necessity of a large sample for any kind of meaningful
mortality estimate. It also does not include parents with no
surviving children.4,14,17,22,24­25 Timaeus18 reports that several
applications of the method have generated reasonable estimates,
but particularly in East African countries, the estimates are much
lower than expected, especially for young respondents.
The sibling survivorship method
Hill and Trussell24 first developed this method of estimating
adult mortality from the proportion of deceased siblings of a
survey respondent. In an effort to estimate maternal mortality,
this method was varied slightly to become the sisterhood
method, proposed by Graham et al.,17 and a number of studies
have estimated maternal mortality via this method.26­32 The
basic method for estimating adult mortality (rather than
maternal) has not been applied as widely.17,33 While this
method suffers from drawbacks, including the assumption that
sibling group size does not affect survival,17 and the risks that
respondents may not know about siblings that died before they
were born or when they were very young,18 or that siblings
may lose touch or be forgotten, or their vital status unknown,
there are convincing reasons that this method is a possibility
for estimating adult mortality. At the very least, its usefulness
should be further explored, as this paper attempts to do. By
limiting observations to those siblings who have reached
adulthood, the assumption that sibling group size does not
affect survival is more reasonable.33 Another major advantage
of this method is that a relatively small number of respondents
can lead to a sizeable dataset.34
All of the methods mentioned above suffer from a similar
drawback, that being a time reference problem. Events recorded
could have occurred at any point during the lifetime of the
respondent or even before the respondent was born. While dates
and times of death are sometimes recorded, they often suffer
from recall biases. One option is to limit the period of analysis to
the 5 or 10 years immediately preceding the census or survey.
While this leads to more recent estimates that are less prone to
bias, it also greatly decreases the sample size, making it difficult
to arrive at meaningful age- and sex-specific death rates.
Limiting the observation period may only be an option for sibling
survival data, as the sample sizes are usually large enough that
analyses can be performed on a subset of the full data.
The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) contain a
maternal mortality module which can be used to estimate adult
mortality based on sibling survivorship information. For several
countries, the DHS collects complete sibling histories; that is,
information on all children born to the respondent's mother,
including the current age of living siblings, and the age at death
and years since death of dead siblings (Macro International
2003). Because of the inclusion of dates and ages, the sibling
survivorship method can be extended to include sex- and age-
specific death rates, and can also be used to attempt to limit the
time reference to some specified period prior to the survey.
Stanton et al.19,35 have completed two assessments of DHS
maternal mortality indicators, a selection of which can be used
for adult mortality estimates. Their 1997 Macro International
report analysed data quality for 14 countries, and a later 2000
paper analysed data for 13 countries. They conclude that the
basic demographic variables (sex, age of living sibling, and age
at death) are virtually complete. Stanton et al. also report that
for age at death, none of the data-quality indicators examined
among reported events were of lesser quality for distant periods
than those from the most recent period.
There are several types of recall problems associated with
these data, including older respondents forgetting events of the
distant past, and younger respondents not reporting on events
that happened before they were born or when they were still
very young.19 This results in general underreporting of mor-
tality in the past.24,36,37
Stanton and colleagues compare DHS adult mortality
estimates with UN general mortality indicators and DHS child
mortality indicators. They find that the DHS adult estimates
are somewhat lower on average than the UN estimates, and
reasonably consistent with child mortality estimates. Stanton
et al. conclude that the proportion of events affected by recall
issues is much greater than with child mortality.
Strategies to improve information on
adult mortality
Of the available indirect methods, questions on survival of all
siblings (not just sisters) has been least utilized, and may
provide a promising method to estimate adult mortality in
settings with poor vital registration systems. This method has
the added advantage that if individuals gave accurate accounts
of sibling deaths, historical information on changes in mortality
could be derived from a simple cross-section. However, it seems
clear that reporting methods would have to be substantially
improved before these data were used for historical mortality
estimation.
This analysis uses 34 DHS with modules on sibling survival in
the women's questionnaire. The respondents are nationally
representative samples of women of reproductive age (usually
15­49 years of age). Table 2 provides a list of countries, survey
years and sample sizes where this module is available.
These modules collect information on complete `sibling
histories'; that is, respondents are asked about all siblings born
to the same mother, their age (both number of years and year
of birth), sex and vital status at the time of the interview. For
siblings who have died, information is collected on the year and
age at death, as well as the number of years ago the death
occurred. This information is then used to produce person-years
lived and number of deaths in 5-year age groups, for males and
females separately, and for 5-year time periods, the latest of
which is the 5 years preceding the interview year. The res-
pondents themselves are excluded from this analysis to
minimize selection bias, as they are selected on the basis of
being alive.
Death rates for each 5-year age-sex group from the DHS are
underestimates of the true rates, mainly due to recall bias on the
behalf of the respondents. To estimate the magnitude of the
recall bias, the DHS death rates need to be compared with a gold
standard or a more accurate estimate of adult mortality. Clearly,
the main limitation in validating the DHS death rates is that
these data exist where vital registration data are not available.
While not a `gold standard', UN estimates can be treated as one
basis for comparison. For their routine demographic estimation,
the UN uses inter-censal survival, the growth­balance equation
and the number of deaths by age and sex to estimate adult
mortality. UN Population Division estimates of mortality by age
and sex from 1950 to 2000 are used as comparators in this

analysis. Their estimates may be inaccurate for each country,
but in this analysis we assume that across the set of countries
the UN data provides an unbiased estimate of adult mortality.
Figures 2 and 3 show for child and adult mortality, respectively,
the relationship between UN estimates and estimates derived from
the DHS sibling survival module. For children, Figure 2 shows the
under-5 mortality rate for male and female children separately.
The correlation coefficient between the UN and the DHS estimates
is 0.67. For most countries the DHS estimates for child mortality
are higher than the UN, but at high levels of mortality the UN
suggests a higher level of child mortality than the DHS.
Figure 3 shows the relationship between DHS and UN
estimates for a summary index of adult mortality, 45q15, which
refers to the probability of dying between the ages 15 and 59.
The correlation coefficient between the two sets of estimates is
0.74. Unlike with child mortality, for adult mortality estimates
from the DHS are lower than the UN for all countries. The
strong relationship between the two sets of estimates indicates
that despite underreporting, overall sibling history data appears
to contain useful information about levels of adult mortality.
The main limitation of using information collected this way
appears to be the undercounting of events of sibling death,
which lead to age-sex specific mortality rates that are too low.
The way forward with this type of mechanism for collecting
information on levels of adult mortality in settings where vital
registration systems are very poor or non-existent may be to
improve the questionnaire design. To improve estimates derived
from sibling histories, the questions may need modification.
They could be expanded to collect information on covariates
that might predict accuracy of recall, such as time of last contact
with sibling, distance between the residences of the siblings,
frequency of family gatherings where information on family
members' well-being might be exchanged, etc.
As an attempt to correct for the underreporting of deaths
in sibling histories, the WHO recently developed the World
Health Survey questionnaire which collects information on
time of last contact between siblings along with the standard
sibling survival schedule, including for each sibling of the
respondent their name, sex, date of birth, and age at death if not
alive (see www.who.int/whs for more information). The World
Health Survey, fielded in 2003, will provide the opportunity to
revise the mortality rates based on sibling histories in three
ways. First, information on time of last contact between siblings
can be used to censor the data. The survival status of each
sibling will be assumed to be known with certainty only at the
time of last contact with the respondent. Second, as some of the
countries that are participating in the World Health Survey are
countries with good vital registration or sample registration
systems (like India, for example), a validation of mortality rates
collected through household surveys will be feasible against a
`gold standard' type of registration system. Third, the World
Health Survey includes respondents of both sexes above the age
of 18. It will provide the opportunity to test whether recall is
related to the sex of the respondent, and expand information on
recall as a function of age of the respondent, as the number
of age groups included will be much broader than the
reproductive age groups included in the DHS. It is hoped that
this experience with analysis of sibling histories will then
strengthen the basis for assessing recall bias as a function of time
since survey, age, and sex of the respondent, and lead to tech-
niques to correct for it.
Household surveys provide the only way, at present, to get
timely information on the impact of new health problems, such
as HIV/AIDS, particularly in countries without elaborate
monitoring systems. This adds to the reasons why it is important
to understand the functional relationship between sibling
history and true death rates. If techniques to correct the biases
associated with recall of sibling death are developed, this
relatively easy way to collect information on adult mortality can
be used to monitor current mortality and time-trends in death
rates. In addition, some verbal autopsy questions can be
incorporated to attempt to determine cause of death from major
causes. For example, if a reliable and valid verbal autopsy
instrument existed for determining deaths due to HIV/AIDS,
mortality from AIDS in high prevalence countries could be
monitored using sibling history techniques. However, it must be
recognized that adding additional modules or questions to a
household survey translates into a need for more resources,
more training, and perhaps dropping other relevant questions
from the instrument.
These methods are not precise, nor can they be given the
quality of survey data on mortality. Yet they offer what could

perhaps be a promising means of obtaining reasonable estimates
of adult mortality levels for the 100 or so countries where there
are no reliable data from routine sources. As a minimum, this
direct evidence should greatly reduce uncertainty about adult
death rates in developing countries and provide a baseline
against which the impact of disease control programmes
can be assessed. Global health policy will be poorly served if we
are as ignorant about adult mortality in 10 years hence as we
are today.

KEY MESSAGES
· The current state of knowledge regarding levels of adult mortality is unacceptably low in many countries in the
world.
· The value of sibling survival data for estimating adult mortality has not been adequately studied.
· Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, this paper suggests that sibling survival schedules contain
moderate information content regarding adult mortality levels, but further study is required to help correct for
underreporting problems.
· Modifications to the sibling survival questionnaires, such as those incorporated in the World Health Surveys
related to time of last contact, may lead to improvements of adult mortality estimates derived from household
surveys.

Commentary: On reappraisal of adult
mortality
PN Mari Bhat
Due to the development of indirect estimation methods for
estimating infant and child mortality from some simple
questions asked routinely in censuses and surveys, and
collection of detailed birth histories in some sample surveys,
there has been marked improvement in the information on
levels and trends in child mortality in the developing world.1
But unfortunately, the same cannot be said about levels and
trends in adult mortality. In recent years, the spread of the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic has
brought the paucity of data on adult mortality into sharp focus.
Although the United Nations does provide estimates of adult
mortality for all the developing countries, in only about one-
third of the countries is such information based on vital
registration.2 The estimates derived from indirect information,
such as on orphanhood, have been found useable in only 4% of
the countries. For about one-third of developing countries the
adult mortality levels are arrived at from the estimates of child
mortality by assuming age patterns of mortality contained in
`model' life tables. The model life tables synthesize the
relationship between mortality rates at different ages observed
in countries that had reliable data on age- and sex-specific
mortality rates. Although they may be useful in approximating
the level of adult mortality for the time periods for which
estimates of child mortality are available, the assumed high
correlation between the levels of adult and child mortality could
become too restrictive when ascertaining trends, especially in
populations affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
It is in this context that Gakidou and colleagues recommend
collection and analysis of sibling survival data.3 It should be
noted that there are two alternative methods of estimating adult
mortality from this information. The `indirect' method,
developed originally by Hill and Trussell4 and revised
subsequently by Timæus and others,5 uses data only on the
proportion of surviving siblings by respondent's age. The data
collected in the maternal mortality module of the Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS) had additionally included data on
current age of surviving siblings, age at death, and time period
of those who have died. Data of this type permit the direct
estimation of mortality rates by age for any time period in the
past, and it is this data and the method that Gakidou and others
discuss in their paper. The advantage of the direct method is
that it is not affected by assumptions about the age patterns of
fertility and mortality made in the indirect method, but could be
sensitive to errors in the detailed data used in the estimation.
Neither of these methods has been extensively used and hence
