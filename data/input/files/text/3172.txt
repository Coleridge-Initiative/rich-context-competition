Abstract:
How does private consumption react to an exogenous increase in government
expenditure? Standard structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) usually
report a positive GDP as well as consumption response, while event studies
report a negative consumption response. We investigate in a SVAR whether
anticipation of the fiscal shock reverses the sign of this dynamic response to a
negative one. As a methodological contribution, we model expectation forma-
tion within a SVAR framework. We show for the US that consumption falls in
reaction to an expenditure shock once the model allows for one-period-ahead
anticipation of this shock. Modelling anticipation of fiscal shocks is thus
crucial to correctly capture their macroeconomic effects. Differences in results
between event studies and VARs can be explained by missing anticipation in
VARs. When re-estimating the two models (with and without anticipation)
for non-defense related expenditures, we find a positive consumption response
for both models. The implications of our results for macroeconomic theory
are briefly discussed.

Non-technical summary
How does government spending affect the real economy, especially private con-
sumption? The answer to this question is highly controversial, both on the the-
oretical as well as on the empirical side. The empirical debate concerns mostly
the question of the best identification strategy. As government spending de-
pends on many economic factors, the identification strategy has to assure that
the fiscal shock is exogenous. A specific problem in this regard is the fact that
fiscal policy might already affect the real economy before it actually occurs
as fiscal policy actions are anticipated. This paper shows that anticipation of
fiscal effects has important effects on the results of empirical studies.
The empirical literature on the effects of fiscal policy in the US can broadly
be divided into two strands: On the one hand, fiscal policy events are identi-
fied with the narrative approach employing dummies for exogenous increases
in military purchases. These shocks raise GDP but lower consumption and
real wages. On the other hand, VAR techniques usually achieve identification
by assuming that government spending is predetermined within the quarter
and find that private consumption, similar to GDP, usually rises after a shock
to government spending. These contrasting empirical findings have important
implications for our view of the macroeconomy. While both the neoclassi-
cal and the Keynesian model predict increasing output, in the former world
consumption should fall, while in a Keynesian framework consumption should
increase. Thus, the narrative approach lends support to neoclassical economic
theory, while evidence from VARs supports Keynesian models.
In this paper we model anticipation in a SVAR to study its importance
in determining the results of the VAR approach. In contrast to Blanchard
and Perotti (2002) who discuss anticipation effects on output, we report the
effects of anticipated fiscal policy on private consumption, where anticipation
effects could change the sign of the response. Moreover, as a methodologi-
cal contribution, we introduce expected fiscal policy in a SVAR framework by
modelling explicitly and transparently the process describing expectation for-
mation. Our results are thus not based on simulations and we stay completely
in the multivariate time series context.
Our main finding is that the positive consumption response in Blanchard and
Perotti's (2002) VAR switches to a negative response, once the VAR is ex-
tended to allow for one-period-ahead anticipation of the shock. Modelling
anticipation in VARs is thus of crucial importance. Once, the model correctly
captures the timing, the empirical results are fully in line with a neoclassical
model of fiscal policy. When re-estimating the two models (with and with-
out anticipation) for non-defense related expenditures, we find a positive and
clearly significant consumption response for both models. Here, the correct
timing appears to be of minor importance.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Wie beeinflussen die Staatsausgaben die Realwirtschaft, insbesondere den pri-
vaten Konsum? Diese Frage ist theoretisch und empirisch umstritten. Auf der
empirischen Seite gibt es eine Kontroverse darum, wie man am besten solche
Schocks identifiziert, da Staatsausgaben in der Regel nicht exogen sind, son-
dern von anderen ¨
okonomischen Variablen abh¨
angen. Ein besonderes Problem
besteht darin, dass Fiskalpolitik schon eine Wirkung entfalten kann, bevor sie
eintritt, da Ausgaben- und Einnahmenver¨
anderungen antizipiert werden. In
diesem Papier zeigen wir, dass die Ber¨
ucksichtigung von Antizipation starken
Einfluss auf die Ergebnisse empirischer Studien hat.
Die empirische Literatur zu den Auswirkungen der Fiskalpolitik in den
USA l¨
asst sich grob in zwei Ans¨
atze unterteilen. Einerseits wird zur Iden-
tifikation finanzpolitischer Ereignisse der narrative Ansatz herangezogen, bei
dem f¨
ur exogene Steigerungen der Milit¨
arausgaben Dummy-Variablen einge-
setzt werden. Solche Schocks erh¨
ohen zwar das BIP, senken aber den Kon-
sum und die Reall¨
ohne. Andererseits werden VAR-Techniken verwendet, die
zur Identifikation finanzpolitischer Ereignisse ¨
ublicherweise davon ausgehen,
dass die Staatsausgaben innerhalb des Quartals ihres Auftretens vorbestimmt
sind. Dieser Ansatz ergibt, dass die privaten Konsumausgaben ¨
ahnlich wie das
BIP nach einem Schock bei den Staatsausgaben in der Regel ansteigen. Diese
widerspr¨
uchlichen empirischen Ergebnisse haben bedeutende Implikationen f¨
ur
unsere Auffassung der Gesamtwirtschaft. W¨
ahrend sowohl das neoklassische
als auch das Keynesianische Modell einen Produktionsanstieg voraussagen,
w¨
urden die Konsumausgaben laut dem erstgenannten Ansatz zur¨
uckgehen,
beim Keynesianischen Ansatz hingegen steigen. Somit st¨
utzt der narrative
Ansatz die neoklassische Wirtschaftstheorie, w¨
ahrend die Ergebnisse von VARs
den Keynesianischen Modellen Unterst¨
utzung liefern.
Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird die Antizipation finanzpolitischer Ereignisse in
den USA in einem SVAR modelliert, um ihre Bedeutung f¨
ur die Ergebnisse
des VAR-Ansatzes zu untersuchen. Im Gegensatz zu Blanchard und Perotti
(2002), die sich mit den Auswirkungen der Antizipation auf die Produktion
besch¨
aftigen, befassen wir uns mit dem Einfluss antizipierter finanzpolitis-
cher Ereignisse auf die privaten Konsumausgaben; hier k¨
onnen Antizipation-
seffekte eine ¨
Anderung des Vorzeichens der dynamischen Reaktion bewirken.
Als methodischer Beitrag wird die erwartete Fiskalpolitik durch explizite und
transparente Modellierung des Erwartungsbildungsprozesses in das SVAR-
Modell eingef¨
uhrt. Somit basieren die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung nicht auf
Simulationen und werden ausschließlich im Kontext multivariater Zeitreihen-
analyse ermittelt.
Die wichtigste Erkenntnis der Untersuchung ist, dass sich die positive Reak-
tion der Konsumausgaben gem¨
aß dem von Blanchard und Perotti (2002)
verwendeten VAR-Modell ins Negative umkehrt, wenn das VAR dahingehend
erweitert wird, dass Antizipation erm¨
oglicht wird. Die Modellierung der An-
tizipation in VAR-Modellen ist somit von entscheidener Bedeutung. Sobald
das Modell die zeitliche Struktur richtig erfasst, stehen die empirischen Resul-
tate voll mit dem neoklassischen Modell der Fiskalpolitik im Einklang. Eine
erneute Sch¨
atzung der beiden Modelle (mit und ohne Antizipation) f¨
ur Aus-
gaben ohne Verteidigungsausgaben ergibt f¨
ur beide eine positive und eindeutig
signifikante Reaktion der Konsumausgaben. Hier scheint die korrekte zeitliche
Einordnung eine untergeordnete Rolle zu spielen.

1 Introduction
The empirical literature on the effects of fiscal policy can broadly be divided
into two strands: On the one hand, fiscal policy events are identified with
the narrative approach, which goes back to Romer and Romer (1989), em-
ploying dummies for announced wars.2 Here, identification is based on the
fact that wars are driven by foreign policy events exogenous to the state of
the economy. Announced wars raise GDP but lower consumption and real
wages (Ramey and Shapiro (1998), Edelberg, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (1999)
and Burnside, Eichenbaum, and Fisher (2004)). On the other hand, VAR
techniques usually achieve identification by assuming that government spend-
ing is predetermined within the quarter. The seminal paper by Blanchard
and Perotti (2002) furthermore assumes that government revenue cannot be
adjusted with discretion to contemporaneous GDP and therefore depends in
the short run on GDP only through automatic stabilizers, which can be ex-
ogenously determined. When employing these identifying assumptions, private
consumption, similar to GDP, usually rises after a shock to government spend-
ing. These empirical results have been confirmed and extended in the papers
by Perotti (2005) and Perotti (2007).3
These contrasting empirical findings have important implications for our
view of the macroeconomy. While both the neoclassical and the Keynesian
model predict increasing output, in the former world consumption should fall

(Baxter and King 1993), while in a Keynesian framework consumption should
increase.4 Thus, the narrative approach lends support to neoclassical economic
theory, while evidence from VARs supports (New-) Keynesian models.
In an important contribution, Ramey (2006) aims at explaining the dif-
ference in the results of these two empirical approaches. She argues that the
VAR techniques miss the fact, that large government spending shocks, such as
wars, are usually anticipated. Within a neoclassical model, it is easy to show,
that missing the point of anticipation will result in a positive coefficient of gov-
ernment spending on consumption as consumption following the initial drop
increases with investment.5 In support of her hypothesis that shocks are indeed
anticipated, Ramey (2006) documents that the war dummies Granger-cause
government spending shocks, but not vice-versa.
In this paper we model anticipation in a SVAR to study its importance in
determining the results of the VAR approach. In contrast to Blanchard and
Perotti (2002) who discuss anticipation effects on output, we report the effects
of anticipated fiscal policy on private consumption, where anticipation effects
could change the sign of the response. Moreover, as a methodological contri-
bution, we introduce expected fiscal policy in a SVAR framework by modelling
explicitly and transparently the process describing expectation formation. Our
results are thus not based on simulations and we stay completely in the mul-
tivariate time series context. We continue to rely on quarterly data to avoid
problems related to annual data, such as the fact that government spending is
probably not predetermined relative to GDP within a fiscal year.
Our main finding is that the positive consumption response in Blanchard
and Perotti's (2002) VAR switches to a negative response, once the VAR is
extended to allow for one- period-ahead anticipation of the shock. Modelling
anticipation in VARs is thus of crucial importance. Our results lend strong
support to Ramey's hypothesis, that the different results of the narrative ap-
proach and the VAR approach are indeed driven by missing anticipation of

opez-Salido, and Vall´
es (2007) as well as
Linnemann and Schabert (2003) make clear, that many very special conditions have to be
fulfilled in order to generate a positive consumption response.
5Households should respond to the increase in government spending by reducing con-
sumption and increasing labor supply, when they first learn about the future shock as the
perfectly anticipated shock lowers lifetime wealth. After the initial drop, consumption should
increase again as the real wage increases with investment. This will result in a positive co-
efficient.

fiscal shocks in VARs. Once, the model correctly captures the timing, the em-
pirical results are fully in line with a neoclassical model of fiscal policy, such as
Baxter and King (1993). When re-estimating the two models (with and with-
out anticipation) for non-defense related expenditures, we find a positive and
clearly significant consumption response for both models. Here, the correct
timing appears to be of minor importance. We discuss possible explanations
of this result based on the nature of non-defense spending and alternatively
based on the size of the shock.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section
develops the expectations augmented SVAR. Section 3 contrasts the results of
the expectations augmented SVAR with the results of the standard SVAR of
Blanchard and Perotti (2002). Subsection 3.2 checks robustness and subsection
3.3 highlights the importance of defense related expenditure and discusses
possible explanations. Finally, the last section concludes.
2 The estimation approach
In order to explicitly take into account perfectly anticipated fiscal policy, we
extend the empirical approach put forward by Blanchard and Perotti (2002),
which constitutes the state-of-the-art SVAR methodology focusing on fiscal
policy. They exploit fiscal policy decision lags to identify structural shocks
and, in particular, argue that governments cannot react in the short run, e.g.,
within the same quarter, to changes in the macroeconomic environment, since
fiscal policy decision-making is a slow process, involving many agents in parlia-
ment, government, and civil society. Consequently, reactions of fiscal policy to
current developments only result from so-called "automatic" responses, which
are defined by existing laws and regulations and which can be taken into ac-
count by applying exogenous output or consumption elasticities. Adjusting
government expenditure or revenue using these elasticities enables us to ob-
tain unbiased estimates of the structural coefficients and thus the structural
fiscal policy shocks.
However, apart from decision lags, policymaking is also characterized by
implementation lags, i.e., the realization of certain policies does not occur in-
stantly but takes some time. This introduces the aspect of anticipated fiscal
policy into this setup. Not taking account of the latter kind of lags could
invalidate the analysis, since it is possible that what we (perhaps incorrectly)
3
identify as structural shocks are in fact anticipated by the private sector. Blan-
chard and Perotti (2002) address this criticism by including future fiscal policy
variables in the estimation procedure. In particular, they assume that agents
perfectly know fiscal policy one period in advance and are able to react to
it. They derive the output response of an anticipated fiscal shock by simulat-
ing the system under rational expectations. Unfortunately, they do not report
consumption responses, where anticipation effects could make a difference with
respect to the sign of the response depending on the true model. Consequently,
as one of the main contributions of this paper, we take up this question and
investigate the relevance of anticipation effects for the dynamic response of
private consumption to fiscal policy shocks.
In order to allow for anticipation of fiscal shocks by the private sector, we
go beyond the three variable SVAR of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) by explic-
itly modeling the process describing expectation formation within the SVAR
framework and derive impulse response functions. In general, we propose the
following setup, based on a standard AB-model SVAR:
Yt

+ Ut
(1)
AUt
= BVt
, (2)
where Yt
= [ct

the vector of structural shocks to be identified. Here ct
denotes real private
consumption, gt

revenue, and vi

is the respective structural shock.
More specifically, the model in structural form has the following represen-
tation:

First, note that equations (3)-(5) represent the structure of the economy,
while equations (6)-(7) model the process describing expectation formation.
In addition, since the model is presented in structural form, the coefficients
g
c1
, r
c1
, and r
g
are elements of the A and B matrices, respectively. Further-
more, we pulled ct-1
out of the lagpolynomial, since we have to treat these
coefficients separately due to the identification approach of Blanchard and
Perotti (2002). Moreover, we have to assume a relative ordering of the fiscal
variables. Here we act on the assumption that spending decisions come first,
i.e., the structural revenue shock, vr
t
, does not enter the expenditure equation,
whereas vg
t
enters the revenue equation.
However, the important thing to note here, is that we explicitly take into
account anticipated fiscal policy by introducing the expectation terms in equa-
tion (3) and model the expectation process by equations (6) and (7). The as-
sumption that fiscal policy is perfectly known one period in advance is reflected
in the fact that the information set with respect to period t also includes vg
t+1
and vr
t+1
, which is reflected in the latter two equations modeling the process
describing expectation formation. Even though a standard VAR also implic-
itly models expectation formation, here we have to augment the basic VAR
equations with the expectations terms and expectational equations, since we
have to deal with a special informational structure. In particular, not only
variables indexed up to time t are part of the information set with respect
to time t, but it also contains future variables, i.e., variables indexed t + 1.
Moreover, one might wonder how the equations modeling expectation forma-
tion are consistent with the equations modeling the fiscal part of the structure
of the economy. The main difference here is that at time t future private con-
sumption is not known, which is however part of the structural fiscal equations
with respect to time t + 1. Consequently, private agents have to estimate this
"omitted variable," and this is done by using all the information available at
time t. This is why the coefficients in the lagpolynomial in the expectational
equations could differ from the respective ones in the structural equations.
In addition, this is also why the coefficient of the corresponding fiscal shock
in the expectational equations does not have to be one, as in the structural
equation. Finally, the structural government revenue shock is also part of the
expectational equation modeling government expenditure, even though it is
not part of the structural fiscal equation, since it could potentially help to
forecast future private consumption.
5
Estimation of this model basically proceeds in three steps.6 First, we look
at the fiscal equations (4) and (5). Here we start by exploiting the assumption
concerning decision lags. In particular, in order to address endogeneity issues,
we use exogenous consumption elasticities of government expenditure and rev-
enue to compute adjusted real government direct expenditure and net revenue.
Furthermore, we not only have to assume that there is no fiscal policy discre-
tionary response to consumption developments within the quarter but also no
response to consumption developments in the previous quarter. This leads to
the following setup:

. (9)
Subsequently, we recursively estimate the resulting equations by OLS to obtain
the structural shocks to the respective fiscal variable, i.e., we first estimate
equation (8) and obtain vg
t
, and then use this shocks series as an additional
regressor to estimate equation (9).
In the second step, we consider the equation modeling private consumption.
We begin by rewriting equation (3) as follows:
ct

and consequently vc

. Subsequently, equation (10) is
estimated by means of instrumental variables regression, in order to account
for the correlation of the respective regressors and error term. Since both vi

and vi
t
(i = g, r) are perfectly known at time t, they are uncorrelated with the
expectational errors in vc
t
. Furthermore, because they are also uncorrelated
with vc
t
, we can use ve
t+1
, ve
t
, vr
t+1
, and vr
t
as instruments to estimate 1
, c
e
, 2
,
and c
r
.
Finally, in the third step, we look at the equations modeling expectations.
Since with respect to these two equations we are only interested in forecasting
and not in estimation of the structural parameters, it is sufficient to just plug
equations (6) and (7) into equations (11) and (12), respectively, and estimate
these by OLS.7
By this procedure we obtain all coefficients necessary to compute the struc-
tural impulse response functions. In particular, it is possible to estimate the
dynamic response to a perfectly anticipated fiscal policy shock.
With respect to data, real private consumption, as well as real direct ex-
penditure and real net revenue are defined as in Blanchard and Perotti (2002).8
The series are seasonally adjusted, in per capita terms, and we take logs. The
frequency of the employed time series is crucial for the identification approach.
In order to exclude the possibility of discretionary fiscal policy actions within
one time period, quarterly data are used. The system is estimated in levels
including a constant, a time trend, and a dummy to account for the large tax
cut in 1975:2. The sample starts in 1947:1 and runs up to 2006:3. The number
of lags for the VAR is chosen to be three as suggested by the Akaike informa-
tion criterion (AIC). With respect to the consumption elasticities, we follow
Blanchard and Perotti (2002) and assume that there is no automatic response
of government spending in the current and the previous quarter, and that the
consumption elasticities of net revenue are 2.08  0.6436 and 0.16  0.6436 for
time t and t - 1, respectively, where 2.08 and 0.16 are the output elastici-
ties and 0.6436 is the average share of consumption in GDP over the sample
period.9
7OLS provides a consistent estimate of the linear projection coefficient. See, for example,
Hamilton (1994), p. 76.
8Figures A-1 and A-2 in the appendix plot the expenditure respectively tax to GDP ratio
as shown in Blanchard and Perotti (2002). The data are taken from the bureau of economic
analysis website (www.bea.gov).
9We perform various robustness checks concerning the elasticities. In particular, as do
Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we also set the output elasticity of net revenue at t - 1 to 0
and 0.5, and consequently the consumption elasticity to 0 and 0.5  0.6436.

private consumption to the spending shock, which is, however, not significant.
Regarding the revenue shock, we find a significantly negative response after
three quarters.
If the SVAR model is extended along the lines described above to allow for
one-period-ahead anticipation of the shock, the results markedly change. As
Figure 2 shows, consumption falls one period before the shock realizes. The
point estimate continues to decrease until one period after the shock realization
but then increases towards zero. Regarding the anticipated revenue shock, we
find a negative point estimate, which is, however, not significant.
These results show, that extending the SVAR model to allow for perfect
anticipation of shocks changes the results substantially. In particular, it alters

the sign of the response of private consumption to government expenditure.
Private consumption now reacts, in line with the neoclassical model, by falling.
After the realization of the shock, consumption starts increasing again. This
finding indeed suggests that the different results coming from "war dummy"
studies and VAR studies might be driven by the "timing." Regarding the
revenue shock, allowing for anticipation renders the previously significantly
negative consumption response insignificant.

3.2 Robustness with respect to elasticities and sample
size
As a robustness check, we modify the elasticity of revenue to private consump-
tion at t-1 to zero. Figure A-3 shows that the negative consumption response
is unaffected. Increasing this elasticity to (0.5*0.6436) yields Figure A-4, in
which the response of consumption to a revenue shock is now significantly
negative, while the response to a spending shock also remains negative and
significant. Furthermore, using the tax revenue elasticity to GDP as the elas-
ticity of tax revenue to consumption does not change the results (Figures A-5
and A-6). Thus, in the sample 1947-2006, we clearly find falling consumption
to a spending shock if anticipation is allowed for. For the more restricted
model without anticipation, consumption increases.
As an additional robustness check, we restrict our sample to the period
1960-1997, on which most results of Blanchard and Perotti (2002) are based.
Figure A-7 plots the impulse response for the three variable VAR. In line
with Blanchard and Perotti (2002), we find a clear and significant positive
response of consumption to a shock to government spending and a significant
and negative reaction to a shock to revenue after 4 quarters.
When extending the model for the shorter sample to allow for anticipation
of the shocks, we again find our results changed substantially (Figure A-8).
The magnitude of the point estimate of the consumption response to a spend-
ing shock is roughly a third. Furthermore, it is insignificant. Regarding the
response to a revenue shock, we also do not find a significant effect anymore.
Thus, while the sign of the response does not change, the pervious result is
still confirmed in the sense that the consumption response is substantially
weakened if anticipation is accounted for.
3.3 Defense spending
It is well known, that the 1950s can be characterized by a strong increase in
defense expenditure due to the Korean war build-up. Figure A-9 plots the evo-
lution of the national defense consumption expenditures and gross investment
to GDP ratio. The Korean war build-up along with increased defense spending
due to the cold war led to an increase of this ratio from less than 7 percent
in 1948 to almost 15 percent in 1952. This figure together with the results
from the restricted sample starting only in 1960 suggests that an analysis of
10
non-defense expenditure is worthwhile.

In Figure 3 we plot the impulse-response functions of a three variable VAR
over the entire sample period without anticipation, in which government ex-
penditure does not include defense spending. It is interesting to note, that
the effect on consumption now appears to be more pronounced and positive.
Apparently, the inclusion of defense spending in the prior benchmark analysis
had reduced the positive impact on private consumption.
Extending the VAR to allow for anticipation of the shock changes the effects
only slightly for government non-defense spending (Figure 4). The magnitude
of the consumption response becomes smaller, while it is more clearly signifi-
cant at all horizons. As regards government net revenue, the estimated effects
are now insignificant at all horizons. For non-defense spending, timing issues
thus appear to be of minor importance.
A potential explanation for the positive consumption response, once defense
spending is omitted, might be the different nature of defense relative to non-
defense spending. In fact, large parts of non-defense spending are performed
by states and local authorities. We therefore looked at federal non-defense
consumption spending and still found a significant and positive private con-
sumption response in both models (Figures A-10 and A-11). It is also possible
that defense spending is really the variable best suited to test wealth effects.
Many other fiscal spending variables either constitute investment or are at least

partially a substitute for private consumption. Yet another explanation is that
the size of the shock matters. Figure A-12 plots real spending per capita and
shows that abstracting from the trend, large variations in the series results
mostly from defense spending. It is possible, that economic agents re-optimize
their consumption/leisure decisions when faced with a large shock, while for
smaller shocks they rather follow a model of a rule-of-thumb consumer who
acts like a credit constraint person. This last interpretation would find support
in recent research by Hsieh (2003), who shows that spending of Alaskan fami-
lies does not appear to react to large and predictable annual payments while it
does react to small and predicted income tax refunds.11 Also, McGrattan and
Ohanian (2007) show that the neoclassical model can explain the very large
World War II fiscal shock well. More work along these lines remains for future
research.
4 Conclusions
How does private consumption react to fiscal policy shocks? In this paper, we
have shown that the estimated response significantly depends on anticipation
of the shock. When estimating a standard SVAR in the spirit of Blanchard
11This difference is explained by the fact that computational costs of re-optimization are
significant.
12
and Perotti (2002), we find a positive consumption response to a government
spending shock. Extending this SVAR to allow for one-period-ahead anticipa-
tion of the shock dramatically changes the results. Private consumption falls
one period before the expenditure shock realizes. These results are robust to
changes in the exogenous elasticities needed to identify the SVAR. Modelling
anticipation of fiscal shocks is thus of crucial importance.
In a second step, we re-estimate the two competing models for the entire
sample 1947-2006, but exclude defense spending from government expenditure.
The results now clearly show a positive consumption response for both the
model allowing and not allowing for anticipation.
These findings suggest, that missing anticipation of shocks indeed appears
to explain the difference of the consumption response found in event studies
(Ramey and Shapiro 1998) vs. SVARs (Blanchard and Perotti 2002) as sug-
gested by Ramey (2006). However, anticipation of fiscal expenditure shocks
appears to be relevant only for defense spending. Private agents indeed lower
their consumption in anticipation of a large increase in defense spending. An-
ticipation of other expenditure shocks is largely irrelevant. Here, private agents
react to government non-defense expenditure by increasing consumption irre-
spective of anticipation.
The results on defense expenditure support neo-classical economic theory
in the spirit of Baxter and King (1993). Private households reduce their con-
sumption in response to the loss in future income due to non-productive war
expenditures. Regarding non-defense expenditure, there are different expla-
nations for the positive consumption response. One possibility is that parts
of non-defense spending have the character of investments thereby potentially
increasing wealth, which should lead to a consumption increase. A different
explanation is that economic agents re-optimize their consumption/leisure de-
cision only if shocks are large, while for small shocks they act like rule-of-thumb
consumers. An answer to this question remains for future research.
