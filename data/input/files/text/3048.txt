Context.--Comprehensive community-wide tobacco control programs are con-
sidered appropriate public health approaches to reduce population smoking preva-
lence.
Objective.--Toexaminetrendsinsmokingbehaviorbefore,during,andafterthe
California Tobacco Control Program.
Design.--Per capita cigarette consumption data (1983-1997) were derived from
tobacco industry sales figures. Adult (18 years) smoking prevalence data were
obtained from the National Health Interview Surveys (1978-1994), the California
Tobacco Surveys (1990-1996), the Current Population Surveys (1992-1996), and
the California Behavioral Risk Factor Survey and its supplement (1991-1997).
Trends were compared before and after introduction of the program, with the pe-
riodaftertheprogrambeingdividedinto2parts(early,1989-1993;late,1994-1996).
Main Outcome Measures.--Change in cigarette consumption and smoking
prevalence in California compared with the rest of the United States.
Results.--Per capita cigarette consumption declined 52% faster in California in
the early period than previously (from 9.7 packs per person per month at the be-
ginning of the program to 6.5 packs per person per month in 1993), and the decline
was significantly greater in California than in the rest of the United States (P.001).
In the late period, the decline in California slowed to 28% of the early program so
that in 1996 an average of 6.0 packs per person per month were consumed. No
decline occurred in the rest of the United States, and in 1996, 10.5 packs per per-
son per month were consumed. Smoking prevalence showed a similar pattern, but
in the late period, there was no significant decline in prevalence in either California
or the rest of the United States. In 1996, smoking prevalence was 18.0% in Cali-
fornia and 22.4% in the rest of the United States.
Conclusions.--The initial effect of the program to reduce smoking in California
did not persist. Possible reasons include reduced program funding, increased to-
bacco industry expenditures for advertising and promotion, and industry pricing and
political activities. The question remains how the public health community can
modify the program to regain its original momentum.

EARLYPUBLICHEALTHapproaches
to reducing population smoking preva-
lence emphasized interventions aimed at
individual smokers.1 However, the re-
sults of numerous studies indicated that
toofewindividualswerereachedforsuch
a strategy to effect a measurable reduc-
tion in population smoking prevalence.2
The varied successes of several compre-
hensive, community and statewide to-
bacco control programs3-7 led to this ap-
proachbeingwidelyrecommendedasthe
most appropriate way to reduce tobacco
use in the United States.2,8 Starting in
1989,theCaliforniaTobaccoControlPro-
gram introduced the use of increased to-
bacco excise taxes to continuously fund
a large, coordinated statewide effort to
reduce the health costs associated with
smoking.9
The voter initiative that led to the
California Tobacco Control Program
clearlyspecifiedthattheprogramtakea
multipronged or "shotgun" approach to
reducing smoking. In addition to impos-
inganadditionaltax($0.25perpack),the
initiative mandated funding for mass
media antitobacco campaigns, local
healthagenciestoprovidetechnicalsup-
portandmonitoradherencetoantismok-
ing laws, community-based interven-
tions selected by a competitive grants
process, and enhancement of school-
based prevention programs. Addition-
ally, it mandated that the program's ef-
fectivenessbeevaluated.9 Inthisarticle,
wereportthelonger-termevidencethat
theCaliforniaTobaccoControlProgram
affected smoking behavior.
One problem with assessing the effec-
tiveness of tobacco control programs
fundedbycigarettetaxesisthatfunding
for evaluation research, including popu-
lation surveys of smoking behavior, be-
comes available only after the first in-
tervention (imposition of the tax) has
occurred. In the United States, surveil-
lance surveys have rarely had designs
that provide precise enough estimates
of smoking behavior at the state level to
allow a sensitive assessment of changes
in trends.10 The research challenge is to
reach valid conclusions from the analy-
sis of preprogram trends derived from
one set of surveys and postprogram
trends from different surveys. Fortu-
nately, another source of data is avail-
able from the collection of cigarette ex-
cise taxes. All states have such taxes,
and the sales reporting methods for tax
assessment are uniform. If there is no
majorchangeintheaveragelevelofcon-
sumption per smoker, trends in smoking
prevalence should mirror trends in ciga-
rette sales, which would increase the
confidence in conclusions based on ei-
ther analysis.
In this article, we assess trends in per
capita cigarette consumption and adult
smoking prevalence in California com-
pared with the rest of the United States.

term impact of a statewide tobacco con-
trolprogramindicatedthattheprogram

had an overall impact during its first
year of operation.5 However, the magni-
tude of this initial effect was not main-
tained over the next 4 years. A different
pattern was observed for men and wom-
en; the rate of decline (trend) in smoking
was greater only in men in the second
period than it was in the preprogram pe-
riod.11 Ifthelatertrendisnotlargerthan
thepreprogramtrend,thentheprogram
can be considered to have lost its effect.
Should an ongoing tobacco control pro-
gram lose its effect, a careful examina-
tion of the possible reasons is essential
so that appropriate revitalization mea-
sures can be taken. Also, it must be con-
sidered that counterstrategies used by
the tobacco industry may play a role in
diminishing a program's effectiveness.
METHODS
Cigarette Sales (Consumption)
The Tobacco Institute reports on
monthly tax payments from all packs of
cigarettes removed from wholesale
warehouses to retail outlets for sale
within each state.12 Data from February
1983 through March 1997 are included in
the present analysis. We estimated per
capita consumption for a given state in
any given year using census estimates
for the state population aged 18 years
and older. Decade census population
datawereassummedtoreflectthepopu-
lation on April 1, 1980, and April 1, 1990.
Supplemental estimates reported from
the Current Population Surveys were
assumed to reflect the population as of
July1ofeachyear.13,14 Toobtainmonthly
estimates of state populations, we inter-
polated regression lines fitted to the
yearly census data. Since retail outlets
appear to stock up in the last month of
both the fiscal and calendar years, we
removed this source of variation by con-
sidering bimonthly averages (for De-
cember-January,February-March,etc).
The per capita consumption represents
the average number of packs removed
from wholesale warehouses during a 2-
month period divided by the population
estimate for the midpoint of the particu-
lar time interval. To further deseason-
alize the data so that trends over time
become more apparent, we applied the
SABL procedure (available in the sta-
tistical package S-plus15) to the bi-
monthlydata.TheSABLprocedurepro-
vides robust estimation of seasonal and
trend components of a time series, pos-
sibly in the presence of nonadditive ef-
fects.16 Thisprocedurewasusedforboth
California and the rest of the United
States to produce smoothed time-series
trendlinesindicatingchangesovertime.
A piecewise linear spline regression
model was applied to the bimonthly raw
datatofurtherquantifytrends.Indicator
variableswereincludedtoaccountforthe
effects of the 6 bimonthly time points.
Thismodelallowsforchangesintheslope
at defined points of time.17,18 The first cut
point was defined as January 1989, when
the additional excise tax was imposed in
California. The deseasonalized trends
suggested that a second cut point oc-
curred in California in mid-1994 and in
the rest of the United States in mid-1993,
so January 1994 was used to make the
analyses consistent. A 2-tailed statistical
test yielded a P value for differences in
slope from one period to the next. Also,
from computed SEs for the piecewise
slopes, a z statistic could be computed to
assess (2-tailed) differences in slopes be-
tween California and the rest of the
United States.
Smoking Prevalence
Surveys.--Smoking prevalence esti-
mates were obtained from several dif-
ferent population-based surveys con-
ducted nationally and in California.19-25
Thesedifferedconsiderablyinthemeth-
ods used, including sample selection,
surveymode(face-to-faceortelephone),
smoking status questions, respondents
(self or proxy20), and sampling variabil-
ity. These issues made combining all the
survey estimates and examining trends
over time problematic. Therefore, the
data from each survey type were first
examined separately to establish that
they were not contradictory to each
other; then they were combined in an
analysis similar to the one used for per
capita consumption.
Since 1965, the National Health Inter-
view Surveys (NHIS) have been the sur-
veillance system of choice for smoking
prevalence in the United States.10,19 Al-
though the NHIS provide only estimates
attheregionallevel,Californiaisthelarg-
eststateintheWesternregion.Thus,the
NHIS sample sizes for California smok-
ing prevalence estimates are reasonably
large.The1978-1994NHISwereusedfor

postprogram smoking prevalence trends

States.TheNHISconductedbefore1978

For CPS, this is the percentage of respondents targeted for smoking supplement interviews for whom the interview
was completed. For smoking status, the response was higher because proxy information is included.

inCaliforniaonaperiodicbasis.TheCali-
fornia Tobacco Surveys (CTS) were the
largestoftheseandspecificallyfundedto
evaluate the California Tobacco Control
Program. To date, they have been con-
ducted in 1990, 1992, 1993, and 1996. The
CTS are random-digitÂ­dialed telephone
surveys of households in California.20,21 A
brief screening interview was conducted
with a household adult to enumerate all
residents and to obtain demographic in-
formation,includingageandsmokingsta-
tus. Both self and proxy data from the
screening interview were included. The
BehavioralRiskFactorSurveys(BRFS)
have been conducted in California every
year since 1984.22 Beginning in 1991, the
sample size was increased, and quality
control procedures were established (us-
ing California Tobacco Control Program
funds) to make this survey a potentially
useful tool for assessing trends. Begin-
ning in 1993, a special smoking supple-
ment (modeled after the CTS), the Cali-
fornia Adult Tobacco Surveys (CATS),
was attached to the BRFS.23 Finally, the
national Current Population Surveys
(CPS),24,25 conducted in September 1992,
January and May 1993, September 1995,
and January and May 1996, were de-
signed to provide state-specific esti-
mates. The 1985 and 1989 CPS also had
smoking-statusquestions,butthesedata
were missing from more than 1.5% of re-
spondents, so they were not included in
our analyses. The various surveys with
sample sizes and response rates (if
known) are summarized in Table 1.
SmokingStatus.--Respondentstoall
surveys were asked if they (or the per-
son they were responding for) had
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime and whether they smoked now.
In a few of the more recent surveys
(NHIS since 1993, CPS since 1992, and
BRFS/CATS since 1994), respondents
were asked if they currently smoked
"everyday," "some days," or "not at all."
The everyday and some days smokers
were considered to "smoke now." The
CTS computed smoking prevalence
based on the smoke now question. The
other surveys also required that smok-
ers report smoking at least 100 ciga-
rettes in their lifetimes before being
asked the current smoking question.
Weighting and Variance.--Survey
weights, provided with each of the data
sets, were constructed to account for the
probability that an individual is sampled
and to adjust for differential nonre-
sponse using poststratification proce-
dures. The poststratification proce-
duresforthevarioussurveyswerebased
ondifferentdemographicsubgroups,and
population totals for these subgroups
were from different years. Because the
demographics of the population changed
between 1978 and 1996, data from each
surveywerestandardized(directmethod
for weighted prevalence) according to
sex, age (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and
60 years), race (white, nonwhite), and
educational level (no college, some col-
lege). Variance estimates were gener-
ated for each estimate (data available
from the authors) so that 95% confi-
dence intervals could be computed and
so that rates of change in prevalence es-
timated from each survey during the
postprogram period could be evaluated
(data available from the authors).
Finally, once it was established that
trends from the various surveys were
notcontradictory,allthedatawerecom-
bined into one piecewise linear regres-
sionanalysis,usingthesamemodelform
as for the per capita consumption data.
This analysis, though still problematic
for all the reasons discussed above, pro-
vides a summary of the prevalence
trends that can be examined against the
per capita consumption data.
RESULTS
Per Capita Cigarette Consumption
Figure 1 shows the bimonthly raw
data, the SABL deseasonalized trends,
and the fitted trends from the piecewise

rette consumption in California and the
rest of the United States. Before the
California Tobacco Control Program be-
gan,theannualrateofdeclineinmonthly
per capita cigarette consumption was
-0.42 pack, which was significantly
(P.01)morerapid(morenegative)than
the rate of decline of -0.36 pack in the
rest of the United States. From January
1989throughDecember1993,theannual
rate of decline in monthly per capita con-
sumption increased significantly (be-
came more negative) in California, from
-0.42 to -0.64 pack (P.001) or by a fac-
tor of 52%. There was a slight but insig-
nificant increase in the rate of decline
during this period in the rest of the
United States. The rate of decline was
significantly (P.001) greater in Cali-
fornia (by a factor of 52%) than in the
rest of the United States during this pe-
riod. These results are summarized in

of the rate of decline identified for Janu-
ary 1989 through December 1993 and
only 40% of the preprogram rate of de-
cline. In the rest of the United States,
theannualrateofchangeinmonthlycon-
sumption halted altogether (only 0.04
pack), which was a significant change
from the earlier period (P.001). The
rate of decline in California, although
considerably diminished, was still sig-
nificantly (P.01) greater than the es-
sentially zero decline in the rest of the
United States for this period.
In December 1988, before the Califor-
nia Tobacco Control Program began,
monthly per capita cigarette consump-
tion, 9.7 packs, was less than the 12.5
packs for people in the rest of the United
States, by a factor of 22%. In December
1996, the per capita consumption of 6.0
packs was 43% less than the 10.5 packs
seen in the rest of the United States.
Cigarette Smoking Prevalence
Change From Preprogram.--The
NHIS data from California and the rest
of the United States are presented in
Figure 2. The rate of decline in Califor-
nia before the start of the California To-
baccoControlProgramwas-0.72%(SE,
0.19%) per year, which was not statisti-
cally different from the rate of decline in
the rest of the United States, which was
-0.79%(SE,0.10%)peryear.After1988,
therateofdeclineinCaliforniaincreased
(more negative) to -0.98% (SE, 0.35%)
per year.This36%increaseintherateof
decline was not statistically significant
because there were too few estimates to
provide sufficient precision. In the rest
of the United States, the rate of decline
was -0.42% (SE, 0.20%) per year, but
the decrease (less negative) from the
earlier rate of decline was also not sta-
tistically significant. The overall rate of
decline in the rest of the United States
from 1978 to 1994 was -0.67% (SE,
0.07%) per year, and in California it was
Â­0.79% (SE, 0.11%) per year.
Changes During Program Period.--
Figure 3 gives the standardized smoking
prevalence estimates with 95% confi-
dence intervals from the various surveys
conducted in California in the postpro-
gramperiod.ThetoppanelpresentsCTS
estimates. The decline (Â±95% confidence
interval) from 20.9% Â± 0.5% in 1990 to
18.9% Â± 0.5% in 1993, -0.85% Â± 0.30% per
year, was significantly greater (P.001)
thantherateofdeclineof-0.22% Â± 0.17%
per year from 1993 to a prevalence of
18.1% Â± 0.4% in 1996.

matesfromtheBRFS/CATS.In1991,the
prevalence estimate was 20.5% Â± 1.6%,
whichdecreasedto17.6% Â± 0.8%by1994;
this represents a rate of decline of
-0.99% Â± 0.59% per year. By 1996, the
prevalence estimate was 18.5% Â± 0.9%,
which was a rate of increase of
0.47% Â± 0.60% per year from 1994. The
difference between the rate of decline in
the early period and the rate of increase
in the later period was statistically sig-
nificant (P.001).
ThebottompanelofFigure3showsthe
standardizedCPSdataforCalifornia.For
example, smoking prevalence was
18.7%Â±1.1%inMay1993and17.5%Â±1.1%
in May 1996, which represented a rate of
changeof-0.39% Â± 0.55%peryear,which
was not statistically different from zero.
In summary, the CTS data indicate a
slower rate of decline in the later period
as compared with the earlier period, the
BRFS/CATS indicate a decline in the
early period and an increase in the later
period, and the CPS showed no signifi-
cant change in the later period.
Combined Analysis.--Since data
from the California surveys did not con-
tradict the observation that a decline oc-
curred in the early period that was not
maintained later, the data from all of
them, including the NHIS, were com-
bined into a single analysis similar to the
one performed on the per capita ciga-
rette consumption data. Figure 4 shows
all the data points and the resulting fit-
ted regression lines, and Table 3 pre-
sentstheratesofdeclineandprevalence
estimates derived from the model. Be-
fore the California Tobacco Control Pro-
grambeganin1989,smokingprevalence
declined at about the same rate in Cali-
fornia (-0.74% per year) and the rest of
theUnitedStates(-0.77%peryear).The
ratesofdeclinewerenotstatisticallydif-
ferent, but prevalence in California was
below that for the rest of the United
States. The rate of decline increased

began, whereas in the rest of the United
States it did not. As a result, the rate of
decline from 1989 through 1993 was sig-
nificantly greater (P.05) by a factor of
nearly 90% in California (-1.06% per
year) than in the rest of the United
States(-0.57%peryear).After1993,the
rate of decline in California and in the
rest of the United States was not signifi-
cantly different from zero, and in both
instances, the change in the rate of de-
clinewassignificantlyless(P.001)than
intheprecedingperiod.Obviously,these
late program trends were less than the
preprogram rates of decline.
From the fitted model (Table 3), adult
smoking prevalence in December 1988
was 11% lower than in the rest of the
United States, and by December 1996 it
was 20% lower.
COMMENT
Analysis of trends in per capita ciga-
rette consumption indicates that the
start of the California Tobacco Control
Program in 1989 was associated with a
50% more rapid rate of decline that was
uniquetoCalifornia.After1993,therate
of decline in per capita consumption in
California slowed to less than one third
of the rate observed from 1989 through
1993 and to less than one half of the rate
of decline observed before the program
began. However, this post-1993 rate of
decline was still significantly more rapid
in California than in the rest of the
United States, for which the decline in
consumption halted.
The smoking prevalence trends from
the combined survey data are fairly con-
sistent with the changes observed in per
capita consumption. The initiation of the
program was associated with a 36% in-
crease in the rate of decline of smoking
prevalence, which was nearly twice the
rate of decline identified for the rest of
the United States. However, from 1994
through 1996, there was no identifiable
decline in smoking prevalence either in
California or the rest of the country. In
California, smokers may be reducing
their consumption rather than quitting,
while it appears that in the rest of the
United States they are doing neither.
It is important to the future of tobacco
control in general and to the California
Tobacco Control Program specifically to
hypothesize why the loss of the early
program success occurred. Additional
analyses will be required to fully under-
stand the influences of various factors.
Did the program lose its effectiveness
because it failed to introduce new and
innovative approaches to interest the
population in tobacco control, or did it
suffer from countermeasures used by
the tobacco industry? The fact that the
tobacco industry lowered prices for pre-
miumbrandsofcigarettesin199326 could
be at least partly responsible. Also, it is
possible that lower funding for the To-
bacco Control Program or increased ex-
penditures by the tobacco industry for
advertisingandpromotionplayedarole.
Finally, the tobacco industry engaged in
a variety of political activities, which
mayhaveinfluencedthelevelofcommit-
mentofthestateadministrationandleg-
islature to the California Tobacco Con-
trol Program. These possibilities will be
examined in some detail below.
There were several tobacco control
strategies that were emphasized during
the early phase of the California Tobacco
ControlProgram.Onewassupportforthe
adoption of ordinances at the local level
that restricted or banned smoking in in-
door workplaces and public places. The
percentage of indoor workers reporting
smoke-free workplaces increased during
the early years of the program but con-
tinuedtoincreaseevenmorelater.21 Cali-
fornia Assembly Bill 13 was enacted in
January 1994, and it prohibited smoking
statewide in 1995 in all indoor work-
places except bars, taverns, and casinos.
If smoke-free workplaces encourage
smokers to reduce their consumption or
quit, the effect on per capita consump-
tionandprevalenceshouldhavebeenevi-
dent throughout the entire program pe-
riod. Another important element of the
veryearlyCaliforniaTobaccoControlPro-
gramwasawell-fundedandeffectiveme-
diacampaign.27 Antismokingtelevisionads
focused on the duplicity of the tobacco in-
dustryandthedangersofsecondhandto-
baccosmoke.Fundingforthemediacam-
paignwasvetoedbythegovernorin1992
and later restored,28 but it was rein-
stated at a lower level than previously
(Table 4). Also, the administration has
been accused of "watering down" the an-
tismoking advertising.27
Economic theory and empirical data
have suggested that cigarette price is a
major determinant of smoking behav-
ior.10,29 However, recent data suggest
that when tobacco control programs are
in place, the price elasticity of demand
may be altered (S. Emery, E. A. Gilpin,
J.P.Pierce,unpublisheddata,1998).30 In
11 of the 14 states that participated in
the American Stop Smoking Interven-
tion Study (ASSIST), where there was a
decrease in the real price of cigarettes
from 1992 to 1994 (which spanned the
date when the tobacco companies low-
ered the price of cigarettes), per capita
cigarette consumption did not increase
as economic theory would predict.30 In
the remaining 3 ASSIST states, the in-
crease in consumption was very mini-
mal. In the non-ASSIST states (exclud-
ing California), all showed a decrease in
the real price of cigarettes from 1992 to
1994, and over half showed the expected
increaseinpercapitaconsumption.Are-

fornia showed that when the excise tax
increase went into effect the percentage
change in per capita consumption
(12.2%) closely matched what economic
theory would predict from the resultant
change in cigarette price (11.8%) (S.
Emery,E.A.Gilpin, J.P.Pierce,unpub-
lisheddata,1998).Theincreasedtaxwas
the first element of the California To-
bacco Control Program implemented,
and as additional programs were intro-
duced, the expected relationship be-
tween price and consumption disap-
peared. Importantly, per capita con-
sumption decreased 8.5% from 1993 to
1994, when the price decrease would
have predicted a 4.9% increase. The
price of cigarettes has remained stable
from 1993 through 1996. These results
suggest that price alone cannot be re-
sponsibleforthelossofeffectoftheCali-
fornia Tobacco Control Program.
The level of funding for the California
Tobacco Control Program has varied
overthecourseoftheprogram.31 Expen-
dituredatafortheHealthEducationAc-
count (which funds the Tobacco Control
Program) are shown in Table 4 (top) for
the line items of mass media, local lead
agencies, competitive grants and school
programs, and other expenses.31 The
funds allocated for administration and
evaluation, which averaged about 5% of
the total budget each year, are not in-
cluded. There is variation over time,
which suggests that money from 1 year
was brought forward to the next, par-
ticularly in the category of competitive
grants.Fromfiscalyear1989-1990tofis-
cal year 1992-1993, the average annual
expenditure was $85.5 million, or $3.35
per capita per year (considering a popu-
lation of 25.5 million people in California
12 years old). However, beginning
with fiscal year 1993-1994, there was a
marked reduction in program funding.
The annual average was $53.0 million, or
$2.08 per capita, which was a reduction
of 40% from the early years of the pro-
gram. This reduction in the level of ef-
fort aimed at reducing smoking in Cali-
fornia is a possible explanation for the
loss of program effect.
Concurrent increases in the amount of
money the tobacco industry spent to pro-
motecigaretteusemayhaveexacerbated
theproblem.ThelowerportionofTable4
shows the estimated amount spent for
each of several line-item categories as
reported to the Federal Trade Commis-
sion.32 Traditional print media and bill-
board expenditures constitute the ad-
vertising category. We combined the
categories for "coupons," "retail value
added," and "specialty item distribu-
tion" into one category labeled "promo-
tional items." The category "incentives
to merchants" includes the Federal
Trade Commission category that they
designate as "promotional allowances,"
whichcoversexpenditurestoencourage
wholesalers and retailers to stock and
promoteparticularcigarettebrands.We
assumed that the tobacco industry did
notspecificallytargetCaliforniawithits
marketingdollarsandthatCaliforniare-
ceived a share of the industry's national
promotion and advertising effort in pro-
portion to its population (approximately
10%).Thisassumptionislikelytobecon-
servative, since the tobacco industry
may have specifically increased their
promotionaleffortsinCaliforniatocoun-
teract the Tobacco Control Program
whentherewereearlyindicationsthatit
was having an impact.7,33 Furthermore,
thedataonexpendituresforadvertising
and promotion are for manufactured
cigarettes only and do not include other
tobacco products, such as cigars. The
amount spent on advertising has de-
creased over time, but the amount spent
onincentivestomerchantshasincreased
markedly, as has the budget allocation
for promotional items. From 1989 to
1993, it is estimated that the tobacco in-
dustry spent an average of $437 million
annually, or $17.14 per capita, in Califor-
nia; thereafter, it spent an average of
$525 annually, or $20.59 per capita, an
increase of 20% from the earlier period.
In the earlier period, the industry out-
spent the program by approximately $5
to $1 ($17.14 to $3.35 per capita), and in
the period from 1993 to 1996, it outspent
the program by nearly $10 to $1 ($20.59
to $2.02 per capita).
The cuts made by the administration
andlegislatureintheCaliforniaTobacco
Control Program budget appeared to be
about the same in each budget category
of the Health Education Account, ex-
cept in 1995-1996, when the expenditure
for the media program was halved. The
decision by the administration to divert
funding for the program could not have
been justified on the basis that the pro-
gram was considered to be performing
aboveexpectations.The1993interimas-
sessment of the program suggested that
since early indications demonstrated
thattheprogramwashavinganeffecton
smoking behavior, this effect needed to
be increased by 50% more in order for
the program to meet its goal for the year
2000.34 The goal was to decrease adult
smoking prevalence by 75% within a 12-
year period. Further, the decision to re-
duce expenditures for the program was
made in the face of active lobbying by
health advocacy organizations and law-
suitsagainsttheadministrationbrought
by the American Lung Association,
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, the
American Cancer Society, and the
American Heart Association.
Recently, a set of internal memoranda
from the Tobacco Institute surfaced.
These internal memoranda, written in
1990, outlined a strategic plan for com-
batting the California Tobacco Control
Program.35 The plan called for lobbying
the California legislature to intervene,
encouraging and supporting minority or-
ganizations to oppose the program, con-
vincing the health services director to
pull or modify media messages that re-
flected poorly on the industry, and en-
couraging the governor to intercede
against the program. There is evidence
that these strategies were used and met
with some success. As mentioned previ-
ously, the governor initially vetoed the
media budget in 1992, although he recon-
sidered following significant public pres-
sure.28 Antismoking media funding was
reduced by 50% for 1995-1996, and anti-
industry media spots were short-lived.27
Furthermore,tobaccoindustrycampaign
contributions to legislature candidates,
other elected officials, political parties,
and political party committees totaled
over $1.5 million in 1995-1996; this was a
70% increase compared with the level of
such contributions in the 1993-1994 elec-
tion cycle.31 On a per legislator basis,
members of the California legislature re-
ceived twice as much money as did mem-
bers of the US Congress, even though
California is not a tobacco-producing
state.31 The slowing of the decline in
smoking in recent years may well be a
resultofthesepoliticalcounterstrategies
by the tobacco industry.
The California Tobacco Control Pro-
gram has confirmed findings from ear-
lier studies3-7 that large health promo-
tion programs can have a major influ-
ence on smoking behavior. Similar
programs have been initiated in Massa-
chusetts (1993), Arizona (1995), and Or-
egon (1996). Furthermore, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
haveprovidedlimitedsupportforthede-
velopmentofsimilartobaccocontrolpro-
grams in other states.36,37 Only the rela-
tively well-funded Massachusetts pro-
gram38 has been in effect long enough to
potentially confound the results of our
analyses. However, Massachusetts rep-
resents a small percentage of the US
population, so it was not surprising that
areanalysisofthedatawithoutitdidnot
change the results.
In conclusion, the California Tobacco
Control Program clearly lost its original
positive effect on reducing smoking,
which must be of considerable concern
to the public health movement. In this
article, we have discussed some of the
factors that might have been associated
with the loss of effect. The Tobacco In-
stitute memoranda35 revealed that the

Glantz39 and Heisner and Begay40 have

Dr Fouts is completely on target. The nidus of the pathology
is among the permanent members of the UN Security Council
and especially in Washington, DC, which has initiated and been
a key player in shaping the atomic age. The concept of nonpro-
liferation was flawed from the outset. The superpowers retained
the right to keep testing and modernizing weapons notwithstand-
ing their huge arsenals and their qualitative and quantitative domi-
nance. At the same time, the nonweapons states were expected
permanently to forswear any intent of acquiring nuclear military
capabilities. Such a double standard could not be permanently
enforced. The options were 2: either eradicate the malignant vi-
rus, nuclearism, or witness its spread. The events in South Asia
confirm the bankruptcy of nuclear apartheid policies.
From the vantage point of our long-range national security,
nuclear weapons offer nothing except a dire threat. With the United
States the strongest nation on earth by every conceivable mili-
tary, economic, and scientific measure, legitimization of nuclear
weapons detracts rather than bolsters our safety. They are po-
tential equalizers, enabling the weak to inflict unacceptable dam-
age on the strong. Nuclear know-how is everywhere. Terrorists
are aware that a nuclear bomb affords "the cheapest and biggest
bang for the buck." No blackmail would be as compelling as hold-
ing an entire city hostage. Few societies are more susceptible to
their malevolent consequences than the rich, urbanized, highly
developed, industrialized North, foremost the United States. It
is already the object of growing global resentment and envy. One
may surmise that it will increasingly be the target for terrorist acts.
Physicians for Social Responsibility and the International Phy-
sicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War have long argued that
nuclear abolition is a "number one public health priority." Po-
litical leaders respond not to historic imperatives but to the clamor
of their constituencies. Only an upsurge of public opinion in fa-
vor of nuclear abolition will sway Washington to reconsider a
flawed, immoral, and dangerous course.

been reported with the use of inhaled corticosteroids, including
cataracts, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
osteoporosis, and possibly glaucoma.1,2
Report of a Case. A 37-year-old woman who had a seizure
disorder that was well controlled with carbamazepine therapy
began to use a beclomethasone nasal inhaler, 42 Âµg of drug per
nasal pump unit, 1 to 2 sprays in each nostril twice daily, for
the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Four weeks later, the
patientbegantoexperiencetightnessinherthighsandincreased
fatigabilitywhensheclimbedstairsorwalkeddistancesthatwere
previouslyreadilytolerated.Findingsonageneralmedicalexami-
nation were normal. Neurologic evaluation revealed a mild to
moderate reduction in strength (41/2/5 range) in neck flexion
and bilaterally in shoulder abduction and hip flexion. Muscle
weaknesshadnotbeennotedinthepast.Findingsontheremain-
der of the neurologic examination, including muscle strength
elsewhere,cranialnervefunction,anddeeptendonreflexes,were
within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid
function test results, cortisol and serum creatine kinase levels,
and antinuclear antibody titer were normal. Serum carbamaz-
epine level was in the midtherapeutic range. Electromyogra-
phy (EMG) showed normal resting activity, without fibrilla-
tions or trains of myotonic potentials. Voluntary contraction of

diminishedaveragesizeofunits,consistentwithmyopathy.The
possibility of steroid-induced myopathy was considered, and
the use of inhaled steroids was discontinued. At the time of fol-
low-up 1 month later, the patient was free of exercise-induced
muscle tightness and reported normal exercise tolerance and
strength. Examination revealed full motor strength, and repeat
EMG showed normal unit morphology and recruitment. With-
out steroids, she has had no recurrence of weakness for 2 years.
Comment. Clinicians may need to consider proximal my-
opathy among the possible undesirable systemic adverse ef-
fects that can occur with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.
