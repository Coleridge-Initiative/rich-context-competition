Domestic Violence as a Public Health
Problem
Domestic violence (typically violence against women) is
acknowledged as a "major public health problem and viola-
tion of women's human rights" (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2011). The WHO Multi-country study on women's
health and domestic violence against women (García-Moreno,
Jansen, Ellsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2005) found that domestic
violence is highly prevalent across cultures and represents a
major burden to the health of women. Not only is it associated
with immediate physical consequences (lacerations, contu-
sions, fractures, etc.) but also with a wide range of chronic
physical health outcomes and mental health issues, some-
times manifesting as physical symptoms (García-Moreno
et al., 2005). Despite this, Vine, Elliott, and Keller-Olaman
(2010) note that it is proving difficult "to place domestic vio-
lence on the policy and/or public health agenda" (p. 339).
Moreover, the Director-General of the WHO has highlighted
the need to raise awareness of domestic violence to further
our understanding of the problem, and implement appropriate
interventions (García-Moreno et al., 2005).
Domestic Violence in Scotland
Reliable prevalence rates for domestic violence are notori-
ously difficult to obtain with systematic underreporting by
victims and political denial often contributing to spuriously
low figures. However, the Scottish Government acknowl-
edges that domestic abuse1 is at an unacceptable level
(Scottish Government, 2009), and recent statistics indicate a
year-on-year increase in incidents of domestic abuse reported
to the police2 between 2002 and 2003 (35,877) and 2011 and
2012 (59,847). The majority of these incidents occurred in
the Strathclyde Police jurisdiction,3 with the majority of vic-
tims being female (Scottish Government, 2012). Further,
recent media reports (e.g., BBC, 2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2011c)
have documented an apparent increase in the number of
domestic incidents4 reported to Strathclyde Police each time
the two biggest football (soccer) clubs in Scotland, Glasgow
Rangers5 and Celtic (traditionally referred to as the "Old
Firm") play one another.
Sport-Related Domestic Violence

lence has focused on partner abuse by male athletes (Young,

Association Between Old Firm Football
Matches and Reported Domestic
(Violence) Incidents in Strathclyde,
Scotland

Abstract
Media reports have suggested that the number of reports of domestic violence may increase when Scotland's two largest,
Glasgow-based football (soccer) clubs, Rangers and Celtic (traditionally referred to as the "Old Firm") play one another.
This study considers the number of domestic (violence) incidents reported to Strathclyde Police between 2008 and 2011
in the 24 hours following these matches, and compares it with the number reported during two appropriate comparator
periods. There is a statistically significant increase in the number of reports following Old Firm matches compared with the
comparator periods. This preliminary analysis confirms previous speculation concerning the association between Old Firm
matches and reports of domestic violence, and highlights the need to better understand the factors leading to such violence
to inform preventive interventions.

2012), there is evidence of a link between sporting events
and increased levels of domestic violence in wider society
(Brimicombe & Café, 2012). Palmer (2011) discusses the
role of the "holy trinity" (see Wenner, 1998) of sports, alco-
hol, and hegemonic masculinity in the context of domestic
violence. Sporting events are commonly associated with
excessive alcohol consumption (e.g., Crawford et al., 2001).
The disinhibiting effects of alcohol mean that certain indi-
viduals may become more prone to impulsive behaviors
(Klostermann & Fals-Stewart, 2006) and be driven by the
contextualized emotional cues of a sports event to perpetrate
domestic violence. Furthermore, Palmer (2011) indicates
that certain aggressive team sporting events are associated
with "increased competitive tensions and aggressive forms
of masculinity" (p. 15). The expression of this masculine
identity can take the form of unprovoked and often spontane-
ous outbursts of violence both publicly and privately. Indeed,
Radford and Hudson (2005) identify the danger to women
(and children) of the heavily masculinist values that can hold
together supporters of a local sport team. In addition, tele-
vised sporting events may exacerbate the problem by pro-
moting the expression of masculinity and alcohol
consumption (either unrestricted at home, or in licensed
premises where there are fewer constraints than at sporting
venues; see Gantz, Bradley, & Wang, 2006) among a large
number of individuals.
Much of the work supporting the association between
sport and domestic violence has been limited to the United
States andAmerican football (e.g., Card & Dahl, 2011; Gantz
et al., 2006; Nelson, 1994; White, Katz, & Scarborough,
1992). What is more, various studies have failed to find an
association between sport and domestic violence in different
contexts (e.g., Braaf & Gilbert, 2007; Sachs & Chu, 2000),
therefore questioning the reliability of the association and
generalizability to other sports and countries. It has been rec-
ommended that further research is required to analyze and
interpret any possible association between sport and domes-
tic violence (Palmer, 2011). Indeed, there is a particular pau-
city of such research in the United Kingdom (cf. Radford &
Hudson, 2005). One area in particular need of rigorous study
is the relationship between Old Firm football matches and
domestic violence.
Old Firm and Domestic Violence
The Old Firm fixture between Glasgow Rangers and Celtic
has long-standing connections with conflictual political and
religious identities (see Murray, 1984). As a consequence,
matches between the two teams have often been blighted by
incidents of collective violence and sectarianism (Carnochan
& McCluskey, 2011). More recently, however, there has
been increasing concern regarding the impact of this fixture
on violence against women. Indeed, the fact that the First
Minister of Scotland was questioned on the issue in the
Scottish Parliament on March 3, 2011, highlights political
perceptions of the severity of the issue (Scottish Parliament,
2011). Moreover, in the same month, a Joint Action Group
(JAG) was established "to maintain and protect the good
reputation of Scottish football and to contribute positively to
efforts to tackle wider social issues--in particular alcohol
misuse, violence and bigotry" (p. 1), with a specific interest
in "improving an understanding of the relationship between
football and domestic abuse" (p. 4), particularly around Old
Firm matches (JAG, 2011).
Evidence for Old Firm­Related
Domestic Violence
In Scotland, concern regarding the apparent increase in the
number of reports of domestic incidents associated with Old
Firm matches has arisen in response to media reports based
on Strathclyde Police data. However, there are a number of
limitations in the analyses described in these media reports.
First, figures for individual Old Firm matches are generated
for the whole weekend or the day after the match. These are
then crudely compared with those of an "average"6 weekend
(BBC, 2011b) or an individual day after the match with the
same day the previous week (BBC, 2011c). Both these
approaches are limited due to insufficient data points, and the
former is also potentially confounded due to seasonality
effects evident in trends of domestic violence (e.g., Braaf &
Gilbert, 2007; Farrell & Pease, 1994). To mitigate these
issues, it is necessary to make comparisons between a greater
number of data points with comparable time periods (e.g.,
the same day of the week and time of day). Second, no
attempt has been made to explore whether the association is
simply the result of high-profile football matches being
played in the city (and related underlying variables that could
account for increased levels of domestic abuse), such as
through a comparison of Old Firm matches with Scotland
International matches played at Hampden Park in Glasgow.
Both these occasions present an opportunity for excessive
consumption of alcohol and the expression of hegemonic
masculinity, which have been associated with incidents of
sport-related domestic violence.
This study represents a preliminary analysis of reported
domestic incidents in the Strathclyde Police jurisdiction. A
comparison is made between Old Firm matches and two sets
of comparator data: non­Old Firm days, seven days after a
match, to investigate the impact of Old Firm matches, and
Scotland Internationals (played at Hampden Park, in
Glasgow), to investigate the potential impact of high-profile
football matches in the city. We hypothesize that the number
of reported domestic incidents will be significantly higher
for the Old Firm condition than the non­Old Firm compara-
tor. Due to the unknown impact of high-profile football
matches in the city, we reserve prediction as to whether the
Old Firm condition will differ from the Scotland International
condition, and whether this in turn will differ from non-
Scottish International comparator days 1 week after matches.

Method
Data comprised anonymized reports of domestic incidents to
Strathclyde Police for the period January 1, 2008, to
December 31, 2011. This included
Any form of physical, sexual or mental and emotional abuse
which might amount to criminal conduct and which takes place
within the context of a relationship . . . between partners
(married, co-habiting, civil partnership or otherwise) or
ex-partners. The abuse can be committed in the home or
elsewhere. (Police Scotland, n.d.)
In total there were 111,474 reported incidents across the 4
years (see Table 1).
To compare the reports of domestic incidents, four cate-
gories of data were created.
·
· Old Firm: Reported incidents were calculated for the
24 hour period following the kick-off (start of play)
for each Old Firm match, including league (n = 17)
and cup ties (n = 4), which were identified from the
Scottish Premier League, Scottish Football
Association, and Scottish Football League websites.
·
· Old Firm comparator: For each Old Firm match, the
exact same 24 hour period seven days after the match
was taken as its comparator (e.g., the Old Firm match
played on Saturday March 29, 2008, was compared
with data for Saturday April 5, 2008).
·
· Scotland International: Reported incidents were cal-
culated for the 24 hour period following the kick-off
for each Scotland International match, including com-
petitive (n = 8) and friendly (n = 5) games played at
Hampden Park in Glasgow, which were identified
from the Scottish Football Association website.
·
· Scotland international comparator: For each Scotland
International match, the exact same 24 hour period
seven days after the match was taken as its compara-
tor (e.g., the Scotland International match played on
Saturday September 5, 2009, was compared with data
for Saturday September 12, 2009).
All dates are shown in the appendix. Although a check
was made that there was no clash between a comparator date
and another Old Firm match or Scotland International, no
consideration was made for whether another football match
was being played in Glasgow, or whether either Rangers or
Celtic were playing other rival teams. Comparator data for
the Old Firm match held on December 28, 2011, was unavail-
able (the data set did not extend to 2012), and so the com-
parator was taken as seven days prior to the match for this
one instance.
The count of reported domestic incidents associated with
each data point was taken from the time of kick-off for a 24
hour period. Thus, for an Old Firm match that kicked-off at
12.30 p.m. on a Sunday, all reported incidents from 12.30 p.m.
Sunday to 12.29 p.m. Monday were included. This approach
was chosen for consistency across groups and to ensure that
each data point passed through a 24 hour cycle. Keeping this
time period consistent and matching each football fixture with
a comparator taken from the same day of the week ensured that
comparator conditions were as similar as possible (accounting
for other background variables) to the match days (Old Firm
and Scotland International matches). Counts were undertaken
independently by D.J.W. and F.G.N. and any inconsistencies
checked. Data analysis was likewise undertaken independently
by D.J.W. and F.G.N., using SPSS version 19.
Results
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for each of the four
conditions. It is evident from the data that for both measures
of central tendency the Old Firm condition had the highest
number of reports of domestic incidents, with the remaining
three conditions having similar numbers of reports.
Exploration of the characteristics of the data set indicated
that there was some deviation from normality and equality of
variance suggesting that the core assumptions for undertak-
ing ANOVA were not met. Thus, the nonparametric equiva-
lent independent-sample Kruskal­Wallace test was
undertaken to compare reported domestic incidents between
the four conditions, 2(3, N = 68) = 26.43, p < .001.
Subsequent comparisons using an adjusted alpha (to account
for the multiple comparisons) identified the location of the
difference (see Figure 1).
It was found that the median number of reported domestic
incidents was significantly greater in the Old Firm condition,
compared with the Old Firm comparator and both Scotland
International conditions. Moreover, there was no statistical

Discussion
Recent data from the Scottish Government (2012) indicate
the increasingly visible problem of domestic abuse in
Scotland. What is more, these data indicate that the problem
is most prevalent in the Strathclyde Police jurisdiction
(which includes Scotland's largest city, Glasgow) and mostly
has an effect on females. There is also mounting concern
over an apparent increase in levels of domestic abuse associ-
ated with Old Firm matches (see BBC, 2009, 2011a, 2011b,
2011c; JAG, 2011). However, this link has been reported in
the media based on crude comparisons of limited data sets.
The aim of this initial study was to develop a robust analyti-
cal approach to undertake a preliminary exploration of the
association between Old Firm matches and reported domes-
tic incidents in the Strathclyde Police area.
The current study compared reported domestic incidents
for the 24 hours following all 21 Old Firm matches between
2008 and 2011, with comparator conditions. First, the num-
ber of reported incidents associated with Old Firm matches
was significantly greater than the number of incidents
recorded seven days later (non­Old Firm days), thereby con-
firming our hypothesis. Second, there was no difference in
the number of reported incidents associated with Scotland
International matches hosted in Glasgow and the number of
incidents reported seven days later (when there was no
Scotland International match). Finally, there were signifi-
cantly more reported incidents associated with Old Firm
matches than Scotland International matches. These findings
suggest that there were a greater number of reported domes-
tic incidents associated with Old Firm matches. The fact that
there was no significant difference in the number of reported
incidents following Scotland Internationals suggests that the
Old Firm difference is not merely due to the presence of a
high-profile football match in the city (and potentially the
excessive alcohol consumption and hegemonic masculinity
often associated with such events). The significant difference
between the numbers of reported incidents during the 24
hours following an Old Firm match compared with the same
period seven days later, suggests that the effect is not a con-
sequence of seasonality or weekday differences in domestic
violence.
The comparisons between the Old Firm and Old Firm
comparator, and Scotland International and Scotland
International comparator conditions, provide compelling
evidence of an effect of the Old Firm matches on reports of
domestic incidents. However, the analysis does have a num-
ber of limitations. First, the comparison between the Old
Firm and Scotland International conditions should be inter-
preted with a degree of caution because there were almost
half the number of data points in the latter, and the days and
time cycles (i.e., start and finish times) for which reported
incidents were calculated are not directly comparable: the
majority of Scotland International matches were played mid-
week during the evening, whereas the majority of the Old
Firm matches were played on the weekend, mid-afternoon.
Furthermore, five of the 13 Scotland Internationals were
friendly matches compared with the competitive nature of
each of the Old Firm matches. Although we acknowledge
these differences as not representing a like-for-like compari-
son, we do believe these matches still represent a useful
comparator.
In addition, the follow-up period of 24 hours may be too
short to capture all associated reports of domestic incidents,
and exclude relevant incidents reported prior to kick-off.
However, our approach offers many advantages over the
analytical method used in previous reports. First, an impor-
tant consideration when inferring an association is the issue
of temporality. With this in mind, it was felt that incidents
reported after the start of a football match were more likely
to be associated with that game than those that occurred prior
to the start of the match.7 The association of reports of
domestic incidents in the lead up to matches could, however,
be a worthy topic for future research. What is more, our
approach is preferable to previous analyses which examined
whole weekends as single data points (as was the case in
BBC, 2011b), thereby making the assumption that an inci-
dent reported in the early hours of Saturday morning was
relevant to an Old Firm match that was not played until mid-
afternoon on the Sunday.
Finally, it is acknowledged that police data may underes-
timate the true level of domestic violence as not all incidents
are reported. Indeed, it has been recommended that health
data be used in violence research as it provides a more valid
indicator of levels of violence (e.g., Florence, Shepherd,
Figure 1. Statistical outcome of the multiple comparisons of the
four conditions.
Williams et al. 5
Brennan, & Thomas, 2011), and sport-related violence spe-
cifically (Sivarajasingam, Moore, & Shepherd, 2005).
However, there are limitations in this approach such as cap-
turing incidents among outpatients (see Carnochan &
McCluskey, 2011) unless specific surveillance systems are
set-up to collect the necessary data.8 Although our approach
may underestimate the true impact of Old Firm matches on
domestic violence, it nonetheless offers a conservative esti-
mate of the severity of the problem, and any underestimation
is likely to be consistent between our conditions.
We echo Palmer's (2011) call for further research to inter-
pret and understand the association between sport and
domestic violence. In the context of the Old Firm, we advo-
cate a mixed-methods approach. First, by undertaking a more
thorough analysis of the available police data (i.e., the impact
of time, location, outcome of match, and location of reported
incident) and cross-referencing this with health data, it will
be possible to conduct a more fine-grained analysis of the
phenomenon. Second, future research should also involve
the collection of primary data (including the use of qualita-
tive methods) to further unpick the narratives of sport-related
domestic violence. In the specific case of the Old Firm, this
would include consideration of the traditionally antagonistic
and politically complex nature of the fixture (see Murray,
1984).
In summary, this article describes an initial study, which
concludes that there is a significant association between Old
Firm football matches and reports of domestic incidents in the
largest police jurisdiction in Scotland. Although our analysis
precludes identification of the mechanism of this relationship,
we do suggest that the Old Firm effect is not merely due to the
presence of a high-profile football match in the city (and
potentially the excessive alcohol consumption and expression
of hegemonic masculinity that is often associated with such
events), or seasonality, or weekday effects. Nonetheless, we
acknowledge the limitations of the approach adopted and
identify avenues for further work to better understand this
association. It is hoped that such work will not only inform
preventive interventions to tackle the association between
Old Firm football matches and domestic violence, but will
add to the literature advocating for prevention efforts to
address sport-related domestic violence more generally.

Notes
1. The terms domestic violence and domestic abuse are often
used interchangeably. Although we favor the use of the for-
mer, we will use the latter when referred to by other authors to
reflect any nuance in usage between the two terms.
2. This may not be indicative of a true increase in the level of
domestic abuse, but rather an increase in the reporting of such
incidents.
3. Prior to the amalgamation of the eight regional forces into
Police Scotland from April 1, 2013, Strathclyde Police was the
largest regional police force in Scotland, and served the city of
Glasgow, and the neighboring areas of Argyll and Bute; East,
North, and South Ayrshire; East and West Dunbartonshire;
Renfrewshire; East Renfrewshire; Inverclyde; and North and
South Lanarkshire. The Strathclyde Police jurisdiction cov-
ered an area of 13,624 km2 with a population of approximately
2.25 million, which is 42.5% of Scotland's population, with
Glasgow accounting for approximately 593,000 of Strathclyde
residents (National Records for Scotland, 2011).
4. ThetermdomesticincidentwasexclusivelyusedbyStrathclyde
Police when recording any report of domestic abuse (personal
communication, Scottish Violence Reduction Unit).
5. In 2012 Rangers went out of business and were reformed as
"The Rangers" in the Scottish Third Division. With Celtic
remaining in the Scottish Premier League, they are unlikely
to play one another until 2015, unless the teams draw each
other in a cup competition or the leagues are substantially
restructured.
6. An average day/weekend is reported by the media as presum-
ably being the mean number of incidents over the course of a
year (e.g., BBC, 2011b).
7. It is acknowledged that there is potential for reports of domes-
tic incidents to occur prior to kick-off, which may be associ-
ated with factors linked to the "pre-match build-up." However,
there is no indication of how long before kick-off would be an
appropriate follow-up period, and many incidents during the
24 hour cycle (necessary to control for the influence of time of
day) would most likely be unrelated to the fixture.
8. We argue that police data provide an important perspective
on the problem to which the addition of health and self-report
data will facilitate a more complete understanding.
