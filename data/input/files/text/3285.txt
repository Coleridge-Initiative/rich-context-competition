Introduction
Concerns on improved performance in secondary schools are
heightening and are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore
due to its overall contribution in the success of schools and
social-economic development of any country. However,
learner performance cannot be divorced from the well-
managed schools. It is the responsibility of school managers
to make schools work and improve the learning outcomes for
children (Moloi, 2003).
The trend of the performance reports for the past 5 years
(2008-2012) from the Certificate of Secondary Education
Examinations (CSEE) in Tanzania leave a lot of doubt on the
effectiveness of school internal mechanisms to ensure high
standards of performance. The uncertainties were also
increased by the manner in which the internal mechanisms
were managed for effective teaching and learning in second-
ary schools in Tanzania. The CSEE results indicate that the
performance of students who scored Division I to III is far
less than the percentage of students scoring Division IV and
zero (Table 1).
From the data in Table 1, it can be argued that there are
great challenges in improving performance in secondary
education. This article is concerned with school perfor-
mance, in terms of results obtained through national assess-
ment of Form IV students, as one of the indicators for quality
education. The article attempts to show how effective man-
agement of school internal mechanisms (vision, mission, and
school practices) contributes toward enhancement of perfor-
mance and improved quality of education. The aim is to pro-
vide an insight to educational practitioners on how schools
with similar characteristics can best manage their internal
mechanisms for improved performance.
The study was conducted in the Eastern School Zone of
Mainland Tanzania (Coast and Morogoro regions). Coastal
region is on the Eastern part of Tanzania mainland and a
large part of the region is situated along the Indian Ocean
coastal belt. The region is located between latitudes 60° and
80° south of the Equator and between longitudes 370°
30and 400° east of Greenwich. Morogoro Region, how-
ever, lies between latitude 5° 58 and 10° 0 to the south of
the Equator and longitude 35° 25 and 35° 30 to the east

Managing School Internal Mechanisms for
Performance Improvement in Secondary
Education: Case of Six Secondary Schools
in Eastern Zone in Tanzania
Consolata L. Chua1 and Herme J. Mosha2
Abstract
Recent apprehensions over the poor performance of secondary schools at ordinary level in Tanzania have given rise to
concerns over the quality of education provided at this level. Addressing the issue of poor performance requires a gargantuan
understanding of the environment under which these schools operate. This study explored how management of school
internal mechanisms contributed toward enhancement of school performance for improved quality of secondary education
in Tanzania. The article reports on the findings of a comparative case study conducted in six secondary schools in the Eastern
Education zone of Tanzania. Findings revealed that, performance of schools was mainly attributed to the kind of management
available in a particular school, which will ensure availability of workable and agreed on mechanisms of providing effective
teaching and learning. The findings provide several important implications for education and school practitioners on how best
to manage school internal mechanisms for improved performance.

Review of Literature
The literature on school management reveals that, school man-
agers play a central role in the success of the school and get-
ting the system to operate effectively (Clarke, 2007; Van
Deventer & Kruger, 2007). Their crucial role is explained by
Palestini (2005), who offers that managers should provide
strategy, vision, and strong leadership for the school. Apart
from that, schools need to have in place a system of measuring
learning outcomes of its learners and evaluating its results as a
means of assessing the performance of the school in providing
effective teaching and learning (Clarke, 2007). To achieve this
goal, schools ought to have effective management which will
ensure there are workable and agreed upon internal mecha-
nisms where performance can be maximized. These roles
seemed to be missing in six secondary schools investigated.
Management can be defined as a process of coordinating,
directing, and guiding the efforts of members of the organi-
zation toward achievement of organizational goals (Mullins,
2005). It is a process because it comprises a series of actions
that lead to the achievement of organizational objectives
such as planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and control-
ling. Schools as organizations have set goals/performance
standards which they want to achieve and therefore manage-
ment becomes the key aspect through which these goals can
be achieved for enhanced performance (Kapolesya, 2010;
Nzigilwa, 2010). Schools therefore, ought to have effective
management which will ensure there are feasible and estab-
lished on internal mechanisms such as school vision, mis-
sion, and practices which guide implementation of the
day-to-day activities of the school. Furthermore, the exis-
tence of experienced and committed leadership which will

ensure that the school vision, mission, and practices are
owned and shared by all stakeholders is of paramount
importance.
A school vision is an aspiration of where the school wants
to be and what it wants to achieve in future, hence gives a
general picture of the work that needs to be done to attain it.
Mission statement on the other hand stipulates how that
vision is going to be achieved by stating what the school does
right now in attaining the vision. It is from the school vision
and mission that schools formulate strategic/action plans
with targets to measure their progress toward attaining their
vision (Gabriel & Farmer, 2009).
It is therefore the role of heads of schools to create a cli-
mate in their schools which will ensure that the vision and
purpose of the school is clear to everyone (Nkosha &
Mwanza, 2009) by encouraging and recognizing good per-
formance from teachers and students through various forms
of rewards so as to improve performance (Bottoms &
Schmidt-davis, 2010; Mbiti, 2007; Nkosha & Mwanza,
2009).
Several studies have been carried out worldwide reveal-
ing the role of heads of schools as managers in improving
school performance. Day etal. (2009) conducted a study on
the impact of school leadership on student outcome carried
out in sampled 20 primary and secondary schools in London.
The findings revealed that actions taken by heads of schools
to set, renew, and review the vision and direction of their
schools had a significant impact on their schools' climate,
culture, approach to learning, leadership of teaching and
learning, and above all on student attainment and progress.
In another study performed in New York city on how school
performance relates to the characteristics of school princi-
pals, Clark, Martorell, and Rockoff, (2009) found that there
was a positive relationship between principal's experience
and school performance, implying that schools led by inex-
perienced principals would reveal poor performance.
According to Ngwako (2001), the management's ineffi-
ciency to develop school vision and mission through a con-
sultative process affects its implementation and subsequently
the success of the school. These studies have one thing in
common, which was revealing how important it was for the
heads of schools to be competent enough to lead their schools
in a visionary way for improved performance.
In Tanzania, studies on performance in secondary educa-
tion have focused more on the extent to which the school
inspectorate genuinely addresses the issue of poor perfor-
mance in science and mathematics in secondary schools (The
United Republic of Tanzania [URT], 2008); how the Ministry
of Education and Vocational Training supervises the large
number of public, private, and community secondary schools
for quality education (Chediel, Sekwao, & Kirumba, 2000).
Although there is general concern on the performance of sec-
ondary schools in general, community schools, which enroll
the majority of the students have been found to have been
performing very poorly as compared with public and private
schools (URT, 2012b). Although all these studies dealt with
performance issues, there is still a gap in literature on how
internal school mechanisms are managed for performance
improvement in secondary schools in Tanzania. To under-
stand better on how management of internal mechanisms can
influence performance, two management theories have been
used to form the theoretical framework of this study.
The most influential theories in providing educational
managers with the background from which decisions can be
made as well as authority be practiced are the management
theories. These theories include motivational theories, scien-
tific management theory, bureaucracy theory, contingency
theories, and systems approach theory. However, the focus of
this article is on motivational theories and the systems
approach theory, as they provide educational managers with
basic understanding on how to successfully manage educa-
tional institutions for quality improvement.
Motivational theories generally advocate that managers
have the responsibility of motivating people in their institu-
tions to work hard and be committed to their tasks so as to
attain the vision set for the organization (Clarke, 2007).
Theory X and Y and Maslow's theory are the two motiva-
tional theories which explain more on motivation from the
management point of view. In Theory X, the assumption is
that workers are naturally lazy and would work as little as
possible because they do not like responsibilities and prefer
to be led by someone to do their responsibilities (Robbins,
2005). This theory therefore suggests that for workers to per-
form their responsibilities, punishments, force, or threaten-
ing conditions must be used. Theory Y on the other hand
believes that people are naturally not resistant or passive to
the goals of the organization, rather they have the ability for
assuming responsibilities, and exercise self-direction and
self-control if they are committed to the objectives of the
organization (Robbins, 2005). Thus, the attitude of any school
manager on how he or she views people under him or her
will have an impact on how those workers perform their
responsibilities for achievement of the organizational goals.
Maslow's theory of motivation assumes that individuals
have a variety of needs, which need to be satisfied in sequence
for them to work effectively. These needs according to
Linstead, Fulop, and Lilley (2004) are categorized into high-
and low-order needs. High-order needs include self-
actualization, self-esteem, and the social acceptance needs,
whereas the lower level needs are safety and security needs
as well as basic physiological needs. This implies that school
managers have the responsibility of not only understanding
workers' needs but also find ways in which those needs can
be met for the workers to be able to work effectively and
achieve school goals.
The importance of viewing schools as social systems being
built up of interrelated parts which work together to achieve
the objectives of the organization (Hoy & Miskel, 2008;
Robbins, 2005) has roots in systems theory. These parts
include the individuals in the organization, the departments,
4 SAGE Open
and even the environment which forms an important part of
the survival of the organization. As such, school managers
have the task of ensuring that every person and every part of
the organization is of equal importance and works in harmony
to achieve school goals.
Method
Research Design
A comparative case study design was used in this study by
comparing best and least performing secondary schools in
the two administrative regions (Eastern zone) of Tanzania.
As the study used multiple data generation techniques to
understand the present status of the quality of secondary
school education in Tanzania, by linking the management of
school internal mechanisms with students' performance in
secondary education, the use of a case study design was inev-
itable. This meant that the results and methodology of this
study can only be used for generalization in areas with simi-
lar cases and characteristics.
Sample Size and Sampling Method
Eastern zone was purposively selected, based on data
obtained from the National Examination Council of Tanzania
(NECTA), which showed that the Eastern zone was one of
the zones that had large schools with the best and worst
results in the Certificate of Secondary Education Examination
(CSEE). Out of 160 secondary schools in the Eastern zone,
the three best and the three worst performing large secondary
schools in the CSEE for 3 years (2010-2012) were selected
and involved in the study. The rating is done at the zonal
level by using students' performance in the national exami-
nation. The sample size was 90 respondents, which included
District Secondary Education Officers (DSEO), Secondary
School Inspectors, Heads of Schools, teachers, students, and
representatives of the School Boards (see Table 2).
The sample size was considered sufficient for the purpose
of the study, for in qualitative research the researcher's intent
is to describe a particular context in depth and not to general-
ize to a context or population.
DSEO, the Zonal Chief Inspector of Schools (ZCIS), and
the Heads of the best and least performing secondary schools
were chosen on the merit of their positions as they were
expected to be conversant with and well informed about the
school internal mechanisms in their zone, districts, and
schools, as well as the extent to which they were working.
Teachers, who had taught for at least 2 years in the same
school, were involved in the study as they were expected to
provide information on the practices in place for ensuring
that there was effective teaching and learning for improved
performance in their schools. Form IV students were also
selected because they were the class that had stayed longest
in the school hence they were able to provide a clear picture
of how well the teaching and learning process was managed
in their schools. School board members were selected
because they represent members of the community in school
matters and were expected to have knowledge on how school
internal mechanisms were used to ensure effective teaching
and learning was taking place in schools.
Data were gathered from documentary review, focus
group discussions with teachers and students, and interviews
with DSEOs, the ZCIS, representative member of the School
Board, and Heads of Schools. Content analysis was the major
tool for data analysis whereby information were put into a
data spreadsheet and organized into themes of analysis based
on research questions.
Research Findings and Discussion
The findings from interviews, focus group discussions, and
documentary reviews of files in schools on management of
school internal mechanisms revealed the following:

respondents, majority of who were teachers and students
from the least performing schools, were not aware of their
school's vision and therefore could not relate how it was
used to ensure enhanced academic performance in their
schools. Schools'mottos were known as they were displayed
in the school logo and/or on walls. Table 3 shows these
findings.
The findings in Table 3 were also supported by the docu-
ments reviewed in the schools. The files in schools revealed
that some schools, which said their vision was not known,
had school development and action plan files. The files stated
the vision and mission of the schools, hence were translated
into development plans for the schools. As the school devel-
opment plans were supposed to reflect the vision of the
schools, the implication is that schools had visions but were
not communicated to all members of the school to ensure
realizations of the vision is attained and quality of education
is improved.
Focus group discussions with students from least per-
forming schools indicated that teachers in their schools were
not making enough efforts to ensure that the vision and mis-
sion were used to enhance academic performance. One stu-
dent stated that
We have not seen how the vision and mission are used to enhance
academic performance because we have not seen any efforts
made by teachers to ensure academic performance is enhanced.
There are only few teachers who attend classes, we don't get our
progress reports at the end of term or year and therefore we do
not even know how we have performed in the last year's exams
and how we should improve. (FGD-D2SC3STS)
These findings indicate that the vision and mission of this
school were not shared with all implementers. This therefore
shows that heads of schools who were the primary imple-
menters and overseers of the school vision and mission had
not done enough to ensure that all stakeholders shared and
owned the vision so that it could lead to the formulation of a
clear mission, aims, and goals of education at school level.
The findings corroborate with Ngwako (2001) who found
out that school management ability to involve stakeholders
in the development of a vision affects its implementation and
the performance of the school.
D'Souza (2001) also stressed that schools need to ensure
that there is an endless articulation and reinforcement of
what the institution honors, values, believes, and cherishes to
accomplish its goals. The importance of the leader to strive
for a shared vision is well documented by Hoyle (2007) who
posits that a shared vision will enable everyone to know what
the organization is trying to do and where it is going. Lack of
a shared vision in schools creates conflicts in the implemen-
tation of school goals as members will be working without
having a shared direction of where they want to go, what
they aspire to attain, and how it is to be realized. It can there-
fore be concluded that the heads of schools who were
supposed to be on the frontline to ensure the vision was
known and shared by all members of the school lacked not
only the knowledge of the importance of the vision in their
schools but also an effective system of communicating the
vision to the members of the schools.
Measures Set by Schools to Ensure Enhanced
Academic Performance
Interviews with heads of schools and board members and
focus group discussions with students and teachers revealed
that frequent internal examinations, and a reward system for
good performance motivated teachers, and strict adherence
to rules and regulations were measures used to ensure
enhanced academic performance in their schools.
In addition findings reveal that frequent internal examina-
tions, which included weekly and monthly tests, were the
most popular measure adopted by both best (64%) and least
(67%) performing schools to ensure that there was enhanced
academic performance in their schools. Table 4 shows these
findings.
However, there was a difference in the way the internal
examinations were carried out between the best and least
performing schools. Focus group discussion with teachers
of the one of the best performing schools revealed the
following:
We have examinations every month which are marked, and
prompt feedback is given to students followed by corrections.
The continuous assessment comprises monthly and end of term
examinations. Students are also trained on speed as monthly
exams are done in a shorter time than the normal national
examinations. Parents get feedback quarterly on the progress of
their children. (FGD-D5SC6Tt)
In the least performing schools, the internal examinations
were used concurrently with quizzes and assignments. Apart
from informing students and parents on their progress feed-
back was also used as a way of identifying weak students to
be given remedial classes. During Focus Group Discussion
(FGD), teachers had the following to say:
We have monthly tests which account for 30% in each quarter
while midterm tests carry 70% of the marks. These tests give
feedback to the students on their performance and help teachers
identify weak students for remedial classes. There are also
quizzes given to weak students and performance is reported to
the academic master. (FGD-D4SC5Tt)
The findings from both least and best performing schools
indicated that at one point both schools had set equal strate-
gies for improving performance, and yet there was a signifi-
cant difference in performance between them. This implies
that frequent tests and examinations alone could not contrib-
ute to improved performance. Giving tests alone to students,

however, cannot bring about improvement if the feedback is
not effectively used to improve students' learning. Tests and
examinations conducted at school level are meant to inform
teachers and students on areas that need more attention so
that teachers can make improvements on how they teach and
howbesttoassiststudentslearn(Ampiah,2011).Furthermore,
Thoonen, Peter, Frans, Thea, and Femke (2011) add that
assessment should be an ongoing activity whereby an effec-
tive teacher can use different methods to monitor student's
learning and give meaningful feedback for making
improvement.
Focus group discussion with students from best performing
schools revealed the reasons for their excelling performance
as compared with least performing schools. They maintained
their schools had teachers who were motivated and hence con-
tributed to improving their students' performance.
. . . we have the best teachers most of whom are graduates and are
enough in numbers. Our teachers are also very motivated as they
volunteer to teach even at night where students also get a chance
to ask questions on areas that need further clarifications . . .
In addition, the best performing schools mentioned strict
adherence to school rules and regulations (48%) which
helped in maintaining discipline and creating a favorable
environment for learning to take place. This factor was not
mentioned by the least performing schools as one of their
measures for enhancing performance. In this regard, the best
performing schools had managed to create a favorable envi-
ronment for teaching and learning to be more effective.
According to Van Deventer and Kruger (2007), schools with
poor culture of teaching and learning have among other
things poor school results, and weak management and
administration. Teachers who were motivated were reported
to be concerned with their students and therefore spent extra
time helping students in areas where they faced difficulties
as well as ensuring that school rules and regulations were
followed. Rules and regulations were said to be of use in
maintaining discipline at school and therefore improving stu-
dents' attention, striving for hard work and good perfor-
mance. This implies that heads of schools had created a
working climate in their schools where teachers felt comfort-
able and happy to do their work.
It has been noted by Nkosha and Mwanza (2009) that
encouraging and recognizing good performance from teach-
ers and students, through various forms of rewards, as well
as creating good working climate for teachers ensure clarity
of vision and purpose of the school to everyone. Improving
professional development practices in terms of in house
trainings, seminars, workshops, as well as providing them
with necessary equipment and resources can also work as an
effective motivational factor (Mbiti, 2007). These findings
also concur with Clarke (2007) who advocated that leaders
need to motivate their workers so as to work hard and be
committed to their tasks to attain the vision set for the orga-
nization. The findings therefore imply that the use of regular
examinations and tests alone do not contribute to enhanced
performance in schools. Motivation for teachers and stu-
dents, good discipline, and a favorable learning environment
must also be present.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The study contributes toward enhancing our understanding
of the school internal mechanisms used by secondary schools
in Tanzania for performance improvement. Although schools
had developed internal mechanisms such as the vision and
mission of the school, the challenge lay on how these schools
used them to ensure performance was enhanced. Similarly,
the use of examinations and tests was still the major strategy
used by both best and least performing schools to ensure per-
formance was improved. However, the findings have shown
that this strategy alone was insufficient; other supporting
measures like the presence of motivated teachers and adher-
ence to rules and regulations must be present.
Taken together, these findings suggest that management
of school internal mechanisms play an important role in the
improvement of school performance and ultimately the qual-
ity of education provided.
The study recommends that Heads of schools/school man-
agers be trained and developed on the areas of developing,
implementing, monitoring, and evaluation of school vision,
mission, and development plans to ensure that realistic goals on
teaching and learning are set and attained and continuously
improved for realization of quality education. Furthermore,
schools should institute their own mechanisms for ensuring
that there is timely and effective feedback to both students and
teachers on how they have performed. This will help in the
overall improvement of teaching and learning practices. In
addition, teacher professional development can work as an
effective motivational factor for teachers to work toward real-
