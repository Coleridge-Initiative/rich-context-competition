 AN EMPIRICAL REASSESSMENT

 evaluate the comparability of the Gallup and Michigan Survey Research

 Center measures for studying levels of partisanship among the U.S. electorate we com-
 pare the overtime distribution of partisanship and the correlates of partisanship using
 the results of Gallup surveys, the National Election Studies, and the General Social
 Surveys. Compared with the Gallup results, both the other two surveys reveal less short-
 term variation and also less total variation. Compared with the Gallup results, the
 National Election Studies partisanship results are less related to short-term electoral out-
 comes and do not appear to be strongly driven by short-term economic and political
 evaluations. Our analyses suggest that scholars should be cautious about using Gallup
 results to revise conclusions based upon analyses that employ the Michigan Survey
 Research Center party identification measure.

 The correlates and consequences

 of party identification have been an on-
 going concern among political scientists
 for the last three decades. There have
 been arguments about the origins of parti-
 sanship, its stability among individuals
 and electorates, the best way to measure
 partisan loyalties, the extent to which par-
 ty identification shapes, or is shaped by,
 policy preferences, the dimensionality of
 the party identification measure, and the
 meaning of partisan independence.

 The recent article by MacKuen,
 Erikson, and Stimson (1989) appears to
 provide important insights that could lead
 scholars to alter their conception of the
 meaning of party identification. Using the
 results of Gallup surveys conducted from
 1945 through 1987, they analyze the party
 affiliations of the U.S. electorate, measur-
 ing the proportion of all partisans who
 consider themselves to be Democrats, a
 measure they call macropartisanship.
 Their analyses reveal a great deal of vari-
 ability in partisan preferences. MacKuen

 and his colleagues suggest that this short-
 term variation follows structured patterns
 of change within presidential administra-
 tions, that these changes have short-term
 electoral consequences, and that they are
 largely driven by short-term economic
 and political evaluations.

 MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson gener-

 alize their findings to the extensive
 research literature on party identification,
 arguing that variability in party identifi-
 cation "forces us to reconsider the stan-
 dard view of party systems and realign-
 ment theory" (1989, 1139). The "mid-
 range dynamics" of partisan change, they
 maintain, "yield partisan movements of
 realignment magnitude (though not
 realignment duration) that require neither
 miracles nor catastrophes but instead
 arise from the routine success and failure
 of ordinary politics" (p. 1139). Rather
 than focusing on long-term changes that
 may lead to partisan realignments, Mac-
 Kuen and his colleagues suggest that
 scholars attempt to account for short-

 term variation and its contribution to
 electoral change.

 As we shall see, MacKuen, Erikson,
 and Stimson's claims are essentially cor-
 rect if one uses Gallup surveys to measure
 partisan loyalties. But their findings may
 have limited generalizability in reevaluat-
 ing the concept of party identification.
 Based upon the sweeping generalizations
 in their conclusions, it appears that
 MacKuen and his colleagues view the
 Gallup measure (which Gallup labels
 party affiliation) and the measure of party
 identification developed by the University
 of Michigan Survey Research Center
 (SRC) to be interchangeable.' Admitted-
 ly, as Converse and Pierce (1985) have
 argued, there may be no "right" way to
 measure partisanship. But we also agree
 with them that "it is of great importance
 not to treat diverse measures of partisan-
 ship as functional equivalents of one
 another" (p. 143).

 We question the implicit assumption

 that the Gallup and the SRC measures are
 equivalent, especially since MacKuen,
 Erikson, and Stimson do not evaluate this
 assumption empirically. As we shall see,
 MacKuen and his colleagues exaggerate
 the degree of volatility in the Gallup
 measure. But even if this problem is ig-
 nored, there is reason to believe that the
 wording of the Gallup party affiliation
 question may lead to volatile results.

 Let us briefly compare the wording of

 the Gallup and SRC items. The Gallup
 question reads, "In politics, as of today,
 do you consider yourself a Republican, a
 Democrat, or an Independent?" By con-
 trast, the basic Michigan SRC question
 reads, "Generally speaking, do you usual-
 ly think of yourself as a Republican, a
 Democrat, an Independent, or what?" As
 Converse has argued: "The 'generally' and
 'usually' qualifiers in the SRC question
 were originally intended to broaden the
 time reference and properly classify the
 long-term identifier who is momentarily
 piqued at his own party, or tempted to

 182

 defect temporarily to vote for a charis-
 matic candidate of another party. A verb
 like 'consider' in the Gallup question has
 somewhat parallel, if perhaps weaker,
 overtones; but the 'as of today' invites in
 the baldest way a very transient frame of
 reference" (1976, 35). Converse reports
 that he had conducted "many casual com-
 parisons" of the two items, and concluded
 that the responses appeared to be strongly
 correlated over time. However, he argues,
 the "face differences in content bear chief-
 ly on the time referent" and concludes, "It
 is my impression that ... the Gallup item
 is visibly more volatile and situation-
 bound than the SRC party identification
 measure" (1976, 36).2

 Given the extent to which MacKuen,

 Erikson, and Stimson generalize from their
 findings, it is essential to determine whe-
 ther similar results obtain when the widely
 used Michigan SRC party identification
 measure is employed. As relatively few na-
 tional surveys have employed the Michi-
 gan measure, there is no way to replicate
 the MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson find-
 ings with the Michigan measure; and we
 do not attempt a replication. Instead, our
 goal is to evaluate the comparability of
 the Gallup and Michigan SRC measures
 for studying overall levels of partisanship
 by comparing Gallup results with results
 from the two major academic surveys that
 use the Michigan SRC measure: the Na-
 tional Election Studies (NES) conducted
 by the Michigan SRC and the Center for
 Political Studies and the General Social
 Surveys (GSS) conducted by the Univer-
 sity of Chicago National Opinion Re-
 search Center.3

 As we shall see, the results using the

 Gallup measure and Michigan measure
 are substantially different. Compared
 with the Gallup measure, both the NES
 and the GSS surveys reveal less short-
 term variation and display less total vari-
 ation. Compared with the Gallup mea-
 sures, the NES measure of partisanship is
 not strongly related to short-term elec-

 toral outcomes and does not appear to be
 driven by short-term economic and politi-
 cal evaluations. Based upon our analyses,
 we must caution scholars to use great care

 and Stimson results to studies of partisan-
 ship that employ the Michigan SRC

 with the Democratic party. In many
 respects, this measure seems closer to the
 way the Gallup measure is constructed,
 but some scholars argue that many self-
 professed independents are in fact "hid-
 den partisans" (see especially Keith et al.,
 1986). The proportion of independents is
 higher today than it was during the 1950s
 and early 1960s, and it is important to
 employ a measure that taps their partisan
 leanings. Our second measure, which we
 label NES2 and GSS2, is the percentage of
 party identifiers and independent leaners
 who either identify with, or lean toward,
 the Democratic party.

 Even though most of our analyses are
 restricted to the same time points em-
 ployed by the NES and GSS, we began by
 examining the relative level of Democratic
 strength for every quarter from 1952
 through 1987.5 Unlike MacKuen, Erikson,
 and Stimson, who use selected surveys for
 each quarter,6 we employed all the avail-
 able Gallup surveys, except for telephone
 polls that consistently show relatively low
 levels of Democratic support. Our results
 are presented in Figure 1. As can be seen

 Variation in Partisanship

 Like MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson,

 we analyze the percentage of partisans
 who consider themselves to be Demo-
 crats. As Gallup results do not differen-
 tiate among independents who lean
 toward a party and those who do not,
 they provide only a single measure of the
 relative strength of the two major parties.
 Because the SRC measure always asks in-
 dependents whether they feel closer to the
 Republican or the Democratic party, at
 least two measures of the relative strength
 of the parties are possible.4 The first,
 which we label NES1 and GSS1, is the per-
 centage of party identifiers who identify

 Southerners, and persons with low social
 status (Glenn and Frisbie 1977).

 Even though the procedures used by
 MacKuen and his colleagues to measure
 partisanship exaggerate the variability of
 party affiliations, the Gallup measure
 clearly displays considerable volatility.
 Figure 1 reveals that the Gallup data dis-
 play considerable variation over time;
 and adding the years before 1952 (see
 MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson 1989,
 Figure 1) reveals even more variation.
 MacKuen and his colleagues justify their
 choice of the Gallup data by arguing that
 one needs a large number of data points to
 treat party identification as "a continuous
 macro phenomenon measured through
 time" (1989, 1127).

 In Table 1 we report variation in over-

 all levels of Democratic support using
 alternative measures of partisanship.
 MacKuen and his colleagues report that
 from 1945 through 1987 the variance with
 the Gallup measure was 25.44, and we
 have presented their finding in our table.
 As our table shows, there is less variation
 on the Gallup measure between 1952 and
 1987, partly because party loyalties am
 pear to have been in considerable flux
 shortly after World War II (see MacKuen,
 Erikson, and Stimson 1989, Figure 1), and
 partly because variation is substantially
 less during the mid-to-late 1980s when
 one relies upon published quarterly
 results. Even so, variation during the 144

 During the mid-to-late 1980s, however,
 there are clear differences between the
 MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson results
 and those we report. Admittedly, both
 their results and ours show a sizable
 decline in Democratic loyalties. But their
 results display substantially more varia-
 tion from quarter to quarter, and they
 present at least one quarterly result in
 which. there are more Republicans than
 Democrats. Although there are single
 polls that show more Republicans than
 Democrats, published Gallup results
 make it clear that there was not a single
 quarter during the 1980s for which there
 were more Republicans than Democrats.
 At least some of the variability in the
 MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson analysis
 results from the relatively high variation
 they report during the mid-to-late 1980s.
 Thus, if changes of "realignment magni-
 tude" involve a shift in majority party
 status, the published Gallup results do not
 show changes of this size during the
 1980s.7 The only result published by the
 Gallup organization showing an actual
 Republican lead in party affiliation is
 based upon surveys conducted in 1946, a
 period when Gallup quota sampling delib-
 erately underrepresented nonwhites,

 quarters between 1952 and 1987 is still
 substantial.

 However, one need not examine every
 quarter during these years to demonstrate
 variability with the Gallup measure; for,
 as Table 1 reveals, variation is almost as
 great when the analysis is restricted to the
 19 biennial time points that correspond
 with the NES election year surveys. As
 variability can be demonstrated by a rela-
 tively small number of observations, it is
 reasonable to employ both the NES and
 the GSS data to determine whether parti-
 sanship is highly variable when the Michi-
 gan SRC measure is employed. As Table 1
 shows, the basic NES measure that in-
 cludes only self-proclaimed partisans dis-
 plays less than half the variation found
 with the Gallup measure." Including
 leaners leads to more variation in the NES
 surveys; but even when leaners are in-
 cluded, the variance in the NES surveys is
 substantially less than variation in the
 Gallup surveys.

 The GSS provide 16 observations be-

 tween 1972 and 1989.9 As Table 1 shows,
 there is clearly more variability in the
 Gallup measure during this more recent
 period. GSS1 and GSS2 also display con-
 siderable variation but only about two-
 thirds of the variation revealed by the

 185

 Gallup surveys. Only 9 NES observations
 are available during these years, and both
 NES1 and NES2 display more variation
 during this more recent period. But, as
 with the 1952-1988 period, NES1 displays
 less than half the variation revealed by the
 Gallup surveys, while NES2 exhibits ap-
 proximately half the variation found
 using the Gallup data.

 Patterned Variation

 MacKuen and his colleagues provide a
 "visual 'test' of the responsiveness of
 macropartisanship to presidential ap-
 proval and consumer sentiment" (1989,
 1130). They display changes in partisan-
 ship during the Truman, Eisenhower,
 Kennedy-Johnson, Nixon-Ford, Carter,
 and Reagan presidencies. Neither the
 NES nor GSS data provide enough time
 points to merit separate displays for each
 of these periods. Nonetheless, we can
 compare the 19 NES observations to the
 comparable 19 Gallup quarters, and the
 16 GSS observations with the 16 com-
 parable Gallup observations.

 Figure 2 compares the biennial NES
 results between 1952 and 1988 with the
 Gallup surveys conducted during the

 levels of Democratic support when Demo-
 cratic loyalties are waning, as in the late
 1960s and the mid-to-late 1980s.

 In Table 2 we present the correlations
 among the various measures. As NES1
 and NES2 are based upon the same
 respondents, these measures are very
 highly related. Of course, the relation-
 ships between Gallup and NES1 and NES2
 are high by survey research standards.
 However, these relationships are below
 what we hope to find if the Gallup and
 SRC questions were measuring the identi-
 cal attitude.

 Figure 3 compares the annual GSS
 results between 1972 and 1989 with the
 Gallup results for the same period. As
 with the NES and Gallup measures, the
 GSS and the Gallup results follow similar
 patterns; but once again, it is clear that
 the Gallup measure displays more vari-
 ability. For example, the impact of Water-
 gate is greater with the Gallup data, and
 the Gallup data reveal greater Democratic
 losses during the mid-1980s.

 aComparisons of Gallup and NES are based upon
 fourth-quarter surveys conducted during each elec-
 tion year.
 bThe NES results are for 1972-88. Comparisons of
 Gallup and GSS are based upon first-quarter surveys
 conducted during each survey year. We compare
 NES surveys conducted in the fourth quarter of
 1972, 1974, 1976, 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1988 with
 GSS surveys conducted during the first quarter of
 the following year.

 Obviously, GSS1 and GSS2 will be very
 highly correlated (see Table 2). Both these
 measures are more highly correlated with
 the Gallup measure than the NES
 measures were; but between 1972 and
 1988 the NES measures are also more
 highly correlated with the Gallup measure

 than they were for the full 36 years for
 which NES and Gallup results can be
 compared. But the relationships between
 the NES and GSS measures and the
 Gallup measures are below what one
 would hope to find if identical attitudes
 were being tapped. In fact, even though
 the NES and GSS surveys are conducted
 during different periods, NES and GSS
 results are more highly correlated with
 each other than they are with the more
 proximate Gallup results.

 predicted seat change is similar using
 NE% and NES2; but the R-squareds fall
 dramatically, and the t-ratios are no
 longer significant. Adding the 1988 results
 slightly reduces the predicted seat change
 for the Gallup measure, slightly reduces
 the R-squared, and the t-ratio remains sig-
 nificant. When the 1988 results are added,
 the results for the NES measures clearly
 deteriorate. Although a modest seat
 change is predicted (now less than two
 seats for each percentage point change in
 party identification), the R-squareds are
 now quite low. The Michigan SRC mea-
 sure does not appear to be useful for ex-
 plaining short-term seat change. Similar
 results obtain when one examines the rela-
 tionship between alternative measures of
 partisanship and the percentage of the
 popular vote for Democratic House
 candIdates. Our results employing the
 Gallup measure are very similar to those
 reported by MacKuen and his colleagues.
 For both the 1952-86 and the 1952-88
 periods predicted vote change is less with
 the NES measure, and the t-ratios are far
 lower. Moreover, for both NES% and
 NES2 the R-squareds are extremely low
 for both the 1952-86 and 1952-88 periods.

 As MacKuen and his colleagues point

 out, testing the relationship of partisan-
 ship to the percentage of the vote for
 Democratic presidential candidates is
 problematic, for the number of cases is
 small. Our analyses consistently show
 partisanship to be more strongly related
 to the major party presidential vote than
 the results reported by MacKuen and his
 colleagues. Their results include the 1948
 election, in which Truman did far better
 than one would have predicted from the
 Gallup party affiliation results. For the
 1952-84 elections, the Gallup and Michi-
 gan measures yield similar results. Includ-
 ing the 1988 results weakens the predic-
 tive power of the Michigan measure.
 While all the t-ratios are significant, the
 R-squared is higher when the Gallup mea-
 sure is employed.

 Electoral Consequences

 MacKuen and his colleagues claim that
 changes in overall levels of partisanship
 have short-term electoral consequences.
 They report that a one-point shift toward
 a party in macropartisanship (in the third
 quarter) leads to a three-seat gain for the
 party in U.S. House elections, a third of a
 point gain in the percentage of House
 votes, and a half-point gain in the presi-
 dential popular vote (1989, 1129). We
 report their results, along with our analy-
 ses for the years since 1952, in Table 3.
 Although we believe that aggregate
 changes in overall levels of partisanship
 have electoral consequences (see Abram-
 son, Aldrich, and Rohde 1990, chap. 8),
 we wanted to determine whether short-
 term changes in the SRC measure yielded
 similar short-term political results. We
 restrict our analysis to the NES surveys,
 since they are conducted shortly before or
 after general elections. We compared the
 short-term electoral impact of changes in
 partisanship as measured by the NES sur-
 veys with the impact of changes in parti-
 sanship as measured by Gallup surveys
 conducted during the fourth quarter of
 each election year.

 As Table 3 reveals, between 1952 and
 1986 (the last election MacKuen and his
 colleagues studied) a one-point gain in the
 Gallup party affiliation measure leads to a
 2.89-seat gain in House elections; but the
 R-squared is only .26. For this period the

 Short-Term Evaluations

 "Macropartisanship," MacKuen,
 Erikson, and Stimson argue, "is a variable
 like others, subject to routine ebb and
 flow as citizens in the aggregate reflect
 their experiences of politics onto the par-
 ties" (1989, 1125). MacKuen and his col-
 leagues' time series analysis demonstrates
 that the Gallup measure responds to
 short-term evaluations of the economy.
 They conclude, "We now know that par-
 tisanship moves and that the economy

 moves it. More precisely, we know that
 the aggregate division of partisanship has
 fluctuated over the past 40 years, that
 those fluctuations have been substantial,
 and that they have had political conse-
 quences. Finally, we now know that parti-
 sanship's twisting course has been shaped
 by the winds of political and economic
 fortune" (pp. 1138-39).

 We have already seen that most of these
 claims are undermined when partisanship
 is measured by the SRC party identifica-
 tion question. Changes in partisanship are

 substantially smaller, and those changes
 do not significantly affect short-term con-
 gressional election results. However, indi-
 vidual-level data clearly show that the
 Michigan SRC party identification
 measure responds to short-term forces
 (see Brody and Rothenberg 1988; Fiorina
 1981; and Lockerbie 1989), so that we
 would also expect aggregate measures of
 SRC partisanship to be affected by short-
 term considerations.10 But as the Michi-
 gan SRC measure seems to tap longer-
 term party loyalties than the Gallup
 measure, results that employ the Michi-
 gan measure should be less driven by
 short-term economic and political consid-
 erations.

 Conducting a time series analysis that
 compares the NES, GSS, and Gallup
 results is complicated because there are
 relatively few NES and GSS surveys.
 Moreover, the GSS studies were con-
 ducted at unequal intervals, and thus can-
 not be used without violating the basic
 time series assumption of equally spaced
 time intervals. Lacking monthly or quar-
 terly data that use the Michigan SRC
 measure, we cannot replicate the transfer
 function analysis used by MacKuen, Erik-
 son, and Stimson. Nonetheless, a test we
 provide clearly suggests that variation in
 the Michigan measure is not shaped "by
 the winds of political and economic for-
 tune."

 Instead of replicating their causal
 model, we focus on Table N-1 (MacKuen,
 Erikson, and Stimson 1989, 1140-41, n.
 13), in which they utilize ordinary least
 squares to assure readers that their results
 "are no artifact" of their transfer function
 approach. They seek to demonstrate that
 lagged macropartisanship, political ap-
 proval, and consumer sentiment can ex-
 plain macropartisanship. We attempt to
 approximate their results with the follow-
 ing steps. First, we create political ap-
 proval using actual presidential ap-
 proval11 minus .29 lagged consumer senti-
 ment (see MacKuen, Erikson, and Stim-

 son 1989, 1140-41, n. 13). Second, we
 standardize political approval and con-
 sumer sentiment, employing (as MacKuen
 and his colleagues did) the index of con-
 sumer sentiment (ICS), which has been
 measured by the Michigan SRC since
 1953. Third, we multiply the standardized
 measures of each variable by -1 during
 Republican administrations. Fourth, we
 employ the NES measures and the Gallup
 surveys conducted during the fourth
 quarter of each election year and create a
 lagged partisanship measure by using
 Gallup and NES measures from two years
 in the past.12 Finally, we regress each par-
 tisanship measure on fourth-quarter parti-
 sanship (lagged two years), fourth-quar-
 ter political approval, and fourth-quarter
 consumer sentiment.

 Table 4 presents the results of this

 analysis for each of the three measures.
 Although we used far fewer observations
 than MacKuen and his colleagues, we
 demonstrate that the Gallup measure does
 respond to political-and especially to
 economic-conditions. Lagged partisan-
 ship, the ICS, and political approval ac-
 count for 56% of the total variation; and,
 as the Q (or residual autocorrelation)
 statistic demonstrates, there is no indica-
 tion of significant serial correlation (see
 Ostrom 1990). These results support Mac-
 Kuen, Erikson, and Stimson's claims that
 partisanship (as measured by Gallup)
 responds to short-term conditions. The
 analysis also shows that one can demon-
 strate the impact of short-term conditions
 even if one employs relatively few obser-
 vations. If the Michigan SRC measure
 does respond to short-term evaluations,
 we have enough data points to demon-
 strate their impact.

 As Table 4 shows, the standard Michi-

 gan measure responds somewhat to short-
 term economic and political evaluations,
 but it is far less responsive than the Gallup
 measure. None of the three variables is
 significantly related to NES1; and, more
 importantly, together they account for

 only 19% of the total variation. As with
 the Gallup measure, there is no evidence
 of serial correlation. NES2 is more respon-
 sive to short-term evaluations; for con-
 sumer sentiment has a statistically signifi-
 cant impact, and somewhat more varia-
 tion is explained. However, the model as
 a whole accounts for only 27% of the
 variation, only half the impact of the
 three variables on the Gallup results.
 Once again, there is no evidence of serial
 correlation.

 These findings lead to two conclusions.
 First, MacKuen and his colleagues are cor-
 rect when they conclude that the Gallup
 partisanship results do strongly vary in
 concert with political and economic vari-
 ables. We demonstrate that this variation
 is sustained even when the number of data
 points is reduced substantially. Second,
 their conclusions do not hold when the
 Michigan SRC measure of party identifi-
 cation is employed, calling into question
 the generalizability of their findings.

 Conclusions

 Although MacKuen and his colleagues

 exaggerated the extent of variability in

 190

 partisanship during the mid-to-late 1980s,
 they have on balance provided a careful
 analysis of the correlates of partisanship
 as measured by the Gallup surveys. Their
 claims that the Gallup measure is highly
 variable, that changes in Gallup partisan-
 ship correlate with election results, and
 that Gallup partisanship appears to be
 driven by short-term economic and politi-
 cal evaluations are supported by our
 analyses.

 Despite these results, their findings may
 have limited implications for the study of
 party identification. MacKuen, Erikson,
 and Stimson fail -to consider that the
 Gallup measure might have built-in short-
 term volatility compared with the Michi-
 gan SRC measure, which is designed to
 tap long-term partisan attachments. The
 SRC measure, too, has some short-term
 properties, as both this analysis and indi-
 vidual-level analyses have demonstrated.
 But the SRC measure, whether employed
 in the NES surveys or in the GSS, has sub-
 stantially less volatility than the Gallup
 measure. Moreover, results using the NES
 and GSS surveys show less total variation
 than results using the Gallup surveys. The
 NES results are not strongly related to

 congressional election results. Finally, a
 time series analysis employing the NES
 surveys suggests that the SRC measure is
 not strongly driven by short-term eco-
 nomic and political evaluations.

 As Converse suggested over a decade

 ago, the Gallup-type measures are likely
 to evoke a different response than the
 SRC measures. Our empirical reassess-
 ment demonstrates that the SRC measure
 has different properties than the Gallup
 measure. At the very least, the Gallup and
 the SRC measures are not interchangeable;
 and scholars should exercise considerable
 caution in generalizing findings based
 upon analyses of the Gallup measure to
 studies of party identification that have
 relied upon the Michigan SRC questions.
 Although MacKuen and his colleagues

 should have been more careful in general-
 izing their findings to the study of party
 identification, their research may lead to
 fruitful insights. The Gallup measure is
 different from the SRC measure, but it
 may well prove to be useful. Their causal
 analyses suggest that we may need to
 combine such measures as presidential ap-
 proval, the ICS, and partisanship. Further
 analysis is needed to evaluate the meaning
 of the Gallup party affiliation measure
 and to determine how it can best add to
 our understanding of public evaluations
 of parties, policies, and political leaders.

 identification measure from 1945 through 1987"
 (1989, 1127).

 2. A recent study by Borrelli, Lockerbie, and

 Niemi (1987) of polls conducted during the 1980 and
 1984 elections also suggests that using the phrase as
 of today to measure partisan preferences yields
 results that tend to favor the party advantaged in the
 most recent presidential contest.

 3. The data employed in our analyses are based

 upon the following sources. Gallup party affiliation
 results from 1952 through 1959 were provided by
 John E. Mueller of the University of Rochester,
 results for 1960-1980 were based upon Public Opin-
 ion Location Library (POLL) results provided by the
 Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, and the
 results from 1981 through the first quarter of 1989
 are'based upon The Gallup Report. The NES party
 identification results are based upon individual
 codebooks for each election year published by the
 Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
 Research; and the GSS results are based upon cumu-
 lative code books published by the Roper Center.
 The number of Democratic House seats at the begin-
 ning of each Congress from 1952 through 1984 are
 from Congressional Quarterly 1985, and the 1986
 and 1988 results are from the Congressional Quar-
 terly Weekly Report. The percentage of the total
 popular vote for Democratic House candidates is
 reported in Ornstein, Mann, and Malbin 1990, and
 the presidential election results come from Scammon
 and McGillivray 1989. The Gallup presidential ap-
 proval results from 1952 through 1959 were pro-
 vided by Mueller, results from 1960 through 1984
 were based upon POLL, and results from 1985
 through 1988 were based upon The Gallup Report.
 Results for the index of consumer sentiment are
 based upon the CITIBASE Data Bank. Procedures
 for aggregating Gallup partisanship and approval
 results follow those employed by Ostrom and Simon
 (1985). With the exception of the results provided by
 Mueller, all of the results we employ are available in
 published sources or from data archives. However,
 we have prepared a list of the values for every vari-
 able used in our analyses, available upon request.
 4. Because the SRC measure also differentiates be-
 tween partisans who feel strongly attached to their
 party and those who do not, it would also be possi-
 ble to develop mean scores that take these responses
 into account. See Abramson 1983, chap. 7 for ex-
 amples of such measures.

 5. As we are not able to compare Gallup surveys
 conducted before 1952 with surveys using the Michi-
 gan SRC measure, we did not analyze Gallup
 surveys conducted between 1945 and 1951.

 6. MacKuen and his colleagues report that their
 measure of partisanship was based upon data ob-
 tained from the Roper Center as a systematic sample
 of Gallup surveys using the first Gallup survey con-
 ducted during every odd-numbered month. These
 results were aggregated into quarterly results (1989,

 1. MacKuen and his colleagues do not report the

 wording of the Gallup party affiliation question and
 do not raise the possibility that it may have differ-
 ent properties than the Michigan SRC measure. The
 manner in which they introduce the Gallup results
 makes it clear that they view these measures as inter-
 changeable: "Party identification may be treated as a
 continuous macro phenomenon measured through
 time. We have gathered data for such a series, pre-
 sented here as a quarterly compilation of the Gallup

 7. Just what changes of "realignment magnitude"

 might be is clearly a subject for debate. For an out-
 standing discussion of alternative definitions of re-
 alignment, see Sundquist 1983.

 tween early September and early November during
 presidential election years; for most midterm elec-
 tions they are conducted during November, Decem-
 ber, and the following January. We therefore com-
 pare the NES results with Gallup surveys conducted
 during the fourth quarter of each election year.

 9. The GSS surveys began in 1972 and were con-
 ducted in every subsequent year except 1979 and
 1981. As the GSS are conducted in February, March,
 and April, we compare these results with Gallup
 surveys conducted during the first quarter of each
 survey year.

 10. For further evidence on the sources of short-
 term change in aggregate levels of partisanship, see
 Allsop and Weisberg 1988.

 11. Because the NES surveys have measured presi-
 dential approval only since 1972, we rely only upon
 the Gallup measure.

 12. If partisanship is highly variable (as MacKuen
 and his colleague argue), there may be problems in
 using a two-year lag for partisanship. However,
 even with the two-year lag, lagged partisanship is
 significantly related to the Gallup measure of party
 affiliation.
