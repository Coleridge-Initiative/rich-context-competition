Abstract
Background: Buprenorphine was approved for use in the treatment of opioid dependence in
2002, but its diffusion into everyday clinical practice in community-based treatment programs has
been slow. This study examines the net impact of efforts by state agencies, including provision of
Medicaid coverage, on program-level adoption of buprenorphine as of 2006.
Methods: Interviews were conducted with key informants in 49 of the 50 state agencies with
oversight responsibility for addiction treatment services. Information from these interviews was
integrated with organizational data from the 2006 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment
Services. A multivariate logistic regression model was estimated to identify the effects of state
efforts to promote the use of this medication, net of a host of organizational characteristics.
Results: The availability of Medicaid coverage for buprenorphine was a significant predictor of its
adoption by treatment organizations.
Conclusion: Inclusion of buprenorphine on state Medicaid formularies appears to be a key
element in ensuring that patients have access to this state-of-the-art treatment option. Other
potential barriers to the diffusion of buprenorphine require identification, and the value of
additional state-level policies to promote its use should be evaluated.
Background
The treatment of opioid addiction in the U.S. is undergo-
ing significant change. In October 2002, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved buprenorphine
(Subutex® and Suboxone®) for use in the treatment of opi-
oid dependence. Interim rules promulgated pursuant to
the Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA) of 2000
opened two distinct delivery systems for buprenorphine.
First, and uniquely, primary care physicians (with appro-
priate training and certification) are permitted to pre-
scribe buprenorphine in office-based settings, provided
that adequate linkages to counseling and other support
services are made available. Second, opioid treatment pro-
grams (OTPs, once referred to as methadone maintenance
programs) are permitted to dispense buprenorphine, but
under restrictions that parallel the manner in which they
presently dispense methadone. Somewhere in the middle
are traditional community-based treatment programs
(often somewhat inelegantly described as "drug free"
modalities), which either can offer buprenorphine
through an approved staff physician, or may affiliate with
office-based physicians to provide counseling and other

support services for patients receiving buprenorphine in
primary care settings.
It is generally hoped that the confluence of these changes
will significantly benefit patients in need of opioid addic-
tion treatment by increasing the number and availability
of treatment options. However, these recent changes at
the Federal level are necessarily mediated by State-level
regulations and policies, which may affect the rate of
adoption of buprenorphine, particularly in OTPs and
community-based treatment settings. Each state has its
own regulations for addiction treatment, including licen-
sure and certification, financing (including disbursement
of block grant funds, and setting Medicaid formularies
and coverage limitations), and other domains that may
influence programs' ability to adopt buprenorphine (for
example, rules for program licensure and use of medica-
tions). State regulations may create or remove barriers to
the adoption of buprenorphine by community-based
treatment provider organizations. Understanding the role
of the state regulatory context in the diffusion of
buprenorphine can contribute to a broader understanding
of the innovation diffusion and technology transfer proc-
esses.
The diffusion of buprenorphine exemplifies the recent
emphasis on the adoption of evidence-based practices
within the addiction treatment field. There is ongoing
concern about the slow rate of adoption of treatment
approaches that have been developed and validated in
recent years [1,2]. Several studies have examined the proc-
ess of technology transfer within single treatment units [3-
5], while others have examined the perceptions and expe-
riences of individual clinicians regarding specific new
treatment methods [6-11]. Despite their importance,
much less attention has been paid to the organizational
characteristics associated with the adoption and imple-
mentation of treatment innovations [12,13]. Even less
attention has been paid to the state regulatory and fund-
ing contexts which circumscribe treatment providers' serv-
ice delivery options.
Generally, the management literature on innovations,
particularly the work of Rogers [14], has been used to
inform the development of hypotheses about the relation-
ship between the characteristics of the innovation, the
characteristics of the potential adopters, and the relation-
ships between those characteristics and the likelihood of
innovation adoption. In terms of the innovation, Rogers
notes that its relative advantage, compatibility, complex-
ity, trialability, and observability all influence the rate of
adoption. Buprenorphine appears to have the "right mix"
of these characteristics from the perspective of community
treatment programs. To the extent that programs are
already treating opioid-dependent clients, and/or are
using medications in the treatment of addiction,
buprenorphine is compatible with current practice. The
medication is less "complex" than other pharmacothera-
pies (e.g., methadone) or even some psychosocial treat-
ment techniques that require a significant investment in
counselor training and clinical supervision. Buprenor-
phine presents a relative advantage over methadone, in
that the legal, regulatory, and abuse and diversion issues
are minimized. Trialability relates to the ability to "test"
the drug on a limited basis before fully committing to its
adoption. By establishing linkages with a DATA-waived
physician, or obtaining a waiver for an existing staff phy-
sician, programs can "test" the use of buprenorphine
without making a long-term commitment or expensive
investment. Finally, the effects of buprenorphine are
highly observable, and indeed in recent clinical trials pro-
gram staff expressed a preference for it over clonidine,
because the advantages in terms of its physiological effects
on patients are especially noticeable [15].
Analyses of early organizational adopters of buprenor-
phine [16,17] identified numerous structural features of
treatment programs as important predictors. Treatment
programs that already had the necessary infrastructure in
place to support the use of pharmacotherapies were signif-
icantly more likely to have adopted buprenorphine in its
first 3 years of its availability. Buprenorphine was signifi-
cantly more likely to be used in programs having one or
more physicians on staff, based in hospitals, offering
medically-managed detoxification services, treating pro-
portionately more opioid-dependent patients, and having
previously adopted one or more addiction pharmacother-
apies. In addition, and net of these other factors, programs
relying predominantly on self-paying and privately-
insured patients were also significantly more likely to
have adopted buprenorphine.
Organizational reliance on private insurance and other
non-governmental funds has been a consistent predictor
in analyses of medication adoption in addiction treat-
ment, including alcohol pharmacotherapies such as nal-
trexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate [11,18-22], as well
as psychotropic medications [23]. Such findings suggest
that programs treating patients who can afford ­ or have
insurance that will cover ­ medications are more likely to
adopt and offer them. But substantial numbers of addic-
tion treatment patients in the U.S. rely on public subsidies
to pay for their care. For example, the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration [24] reports
that 48% of treatment admissions in 2005 listed Medicaid
or "other government sources" as their primary expected
or actual form of payment. If state and local payers do not
include buprenorphine as a covered benefit, many
patients will be unable to afford the medication, and the
providers from which they seek care may be less likely to
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:17 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/17

offer it. The relationship between state-level policies and
program-level service delivery offerings has not been sys-
tematically explored.
For the most part, the innovations literature assumes that
would-be innovators make adoption decisions based on
the characteristics of the innovation and the organiza-
tion's capacity to integrate it into its operations. But issues
such as patient payment methods point towards the
broader contexts within which such decisions are made,
and these contexts provide important incentives and bar-
riers to the adoption of pharmacotherapies in addiction
treatment. Institutional theory provides a framework for
understanding the relationship between organizational
decision-making and the broader operating environment
[25]. An institutional perspective views organizations as
dependent on their environment for both incentives to
adopt innovations, as well as justifications to legitimate
their actions [26,27]. Regulatory agencies (including
accrediting bodies, payers, and state licensing bodies) set
the tone for innovation by promoting policies and
"model programs," and in the case of addiction treatment,
define clinically acceptable standards of care. By defining
policies and payment structures, states can be influential
in encouraging or impeding the adoption of evidence-
based practices at the organizational level. While institu-
tional theory provides a conceptual basis for considering
state policies in the adoption of medications, these
remain understudied. This context is of specific concern in
the case of buprenorphine.
State Environments and Organizational Innovation:
Making the Link
There is scant research that has focused on states as con-
texts for innovation, or as change agents in the innovation
diffusion process. However, there is some research to sug-
gest that attending to these environmental issues could
enhance our understanding of the innovation process
within organizations that are subject to state oversight.
For example, Koyanagi et al. [28] reviewed state Medicaid
coverage for psychiatric medications, and found substan-
tial variation among states not only in the policies used,
but in their application to different medications. Such var-
iation might explain providers' decisions to incorporate
these medications into their routine clinical practice.
Another study of this type [29] reviewed the availability of
coverage for methadone maintenance in state Medicaid
managed care programs in 1998. This study demonstrated
substantial variation across states in terms of the nature
and extent of benefits for persons seeking methadone
treatment. Among the 50 states and the District of Colum-
bia, they identified 25 states with no Medicaid coverage
for methadone maintenance (including 8 states that, at
the time, did not have any operating methadone pro-
grams); 13 states that excluded methadone from their
Medicaid managed care plans; and 12 states where meth-
adone services were included in Medicaid managed care
plans, although service limits were imposed in 10 of those
states. Although the opioid treatment system has substan-
tially changed since this article was written, its findings
provide some indication of the potential scope of varia-
tion that may be seen in the current state-level substance
abuse funding environment, which may in turn be
expected to influence adoption of new forms of treatment.
Research integrating state policy data and organizational-
or patient-level data is rare in the behavioral healthcare lit-
erature, but a few examples suggest potential research
directions. D'Aunno and colleagues have measured the
influence of key external stakeholders on addiction treat-
ment programs, finding associations between accredita-
tion/licensure status and the adoption of HIV prevention
practices [30] as well as the provision of methadone main-
tenance services meeting evidence-based standards for
good clinical practice [31,32]. Such findings demonstrate
that treatment providers may implement programming at
least in part in response to the demands of agencies to
which they are accountable. In other work, Goldman et al.
[33] reviewed state Medicaid and other public assistance
programs for HIV-positive patients, and concluded that
patients' economic outcomes were predicted in part by the
generosity of state coverage benefits for HIV/AIDS medi-
cations. While those analyses did not integrate organiza-
tional-level data on service provision and availability,
they are suggestive of potential linkages between state pol-
icy and patient outcomes.
A recent study on the association between state-level fac-
tors and program-level adoption of naltrexone is espe-
cially informative [34]. While naltrexone has been
available for the treatment of alcohol dependence since
1994, uptake among community treatment programs has
been stagnant for quite some time. State-level factors
including general Medicaid policies (e.g., limits on sub-
stance abuse treatment benefits, inclusion of generic drugs
on the formulary), funding for public welfare, and popu-
lation characteristics explained 16% of the variance in
program-level adoption of naltrexone as of 2003. While
the study controlled for a host of state-level factors, it did
not specifically gather data on whether states' Medicaid
programs provided coverage for the use of naltrexone as a
treatment for alcohol dependence. Thus, while a sizeable
proportion of the total variance in program-level naltrex-
one adoption was explained by characteristics of their
states' policies, the direct relationship between availability
of Medicaid coverage for a specific medication and pro-
gram-level prescribing behavior remains unmeasured.

A final case study warrants mention, as it continues to pro-
vide important lessons for the opioid treatment field. That
case involves the failed diffusion of levo-alpha-acetyl-
methadol (LAAM), a long-acting opioid agonist approved
by the FDA in 1993. At the time of its introduction, LAAM
appeared to offer several advantages relative to metha-
done, in particular the ability to maintain patients on a
thrice-weekly (instead of daily) dosing schedule. Clini-
cians writing at the time of LAAM's approval expressed
optimism about the potential for LAAM to increase access
to treatment, integrate opioid addiction treatment into
mainstream medicine, enhance providers' and patients'
otherwise-limited treatment options, and achieve clini-
cally advantageous results with less frequent dosing [e.g.
[35,36]]. However, three years after its approval, few clin-
ics were dispensing LAAM, and few inroads had been
made in its diffusion [37]. For a number of reasons, pro-
duction of the medication was ultimately discontinued by
the manufacturer in 2003.
While some of the barriers to the diffusion of LAAM
stemmed from resistance among the methadone treat-
ment community itself, there was widespread consensus
that layers of state and local regulatory barriers were as
much to blame for its low rate of adoption [38]. State reg-
ulations for methadone needed to be modified to include
LAAM, and rescheduling of the drug as a controlled sub-
stance was often required at the state level; in many cases,
states failed to act on these measures [39]. As a result,
states' inaction impeded the adoption of LAAM by OTPs.
A growing consensus that the over-regulation of the opi-
oid addiction treatment field was impeding the delivery of
optimal clinical care led to the development of a new
accreditation-based oversight system for the field. It is in
this new context of federal oversight, and perhaps
informed by lessons learned from LAAM, that buprenor-
phine was introduced.
This paper extends previous research on the predictors of
buprenorphine adoption by examining structural,
resource, and environmental variables in the U.S. popula-
tion of substance abuse treatment programs. Controlling
for organizational characteristics, the orientation and
actions of state regulatory agencies are examined, and
their net effect on program-level clinical decisions is esti-
mated.
Methods
State Agency Interviews
In mid-2006, we conducted brief telephone interviews
with at least one staff member in the agency having pri-
mary oversight responsibility for the use of buprenor-
phine in each state. Our initial point of contact in every
state was the single state agency (SSA), which is responsi-
ble for oversight of addiction services and disbursement
of block grant funds. In 29 states, we were directed to
speak with the State Methadone Authority (SMA) for
information about buprenorphine. Information was
obtained from 49 states; one state did not respond to
repeated requests for an interview. Respondents were
asked a number of questions about the state's policies
related to the use of buprenorphine for addiction treat-
ment, including the availability of Medicaid coverage, the
presence of any state requirements above and beyond pre-
vailing Federal requirements for the prescription of the
medication, and the general disposition of the state office
toward the use of buprenorphine in community-based
treatment programs. The responses to several key ques-
tions were utilized as predictor variables in multivariate
models examining program-level adoption of buprenor-
phine.
State agency staff were asked whether buprenorphine was
a covered Medicaid benefit for addiction treatment.
Although we collected some detail on the nature and
extent of coverage provided (e.g., special populations, pre-
approval requirements, and prescription limits), there
was insufficient variation in these responses to meaning-
fully differentiate states based on this detailed informa-
tion, as are often used in analyses of other, more
common, medications. Thus, for these analyses, we use a
simple dichotomous variable measuring whether Medic-
aid provides any coverage for buprenorphine in the state.
In all, 28 states reported having Medicaid coverage for
buprenorphine at the time of our interviews in 2006. (These
states were AK, AZ, CA, DE, FL, HI, IL, MD, MA, MI, MN,
NE, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, PA, RI, SD, TN, VT, VA,
WA, WV, WI and WY.)
A series of additional questions measured the extent to
which each of the responding state agencies encouraged
or actively facilitated the adoption of buprenorphine by
community treatment programs. First, we asked whether
the state agency had distributed to treatment providers
two recent SAMHSA-authored clinical guidelines on the
use of medication-assisted therapy for opioid dependence
[40,41]. In all, 23 of the responding agencies reported that
they had distributed one or both of these publications
either in hard copy or via internet links. Fifteen state agen-
cies reported that they had not distributed these materials,
while eleven state agency respondents reported being
unfamiliar with these treatment improvement protocols.
The tenor of SSA/SMA guidance to OTPs regarding
buprenorphine was also informative. There is variability
among states in the extent to which buprenorphine is
viewed as a preferable alternative to methadone, and
whether mainstream treatment facilities are viewed as
preferable loci of care to OTPs. Along these lines, 7 states
had requirements that OTP advise their clients about the
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:17 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/17

availability of buprenorphine; an additional 14 states
actively encouraged OTPs to do so. The remaining states
had provided no such guidance to OTPs. When asked a
more general question about the state agency's orienta-
tion toward buprenorphine, 23 respondents characterized
their state agency as "actively encouraging" the use of
buprenorphine by addiction treatment providers; the
remaining 26 indicated that their agency had taken "no
real position" on buprenorphine. No respondents charac-
terized their state as having a negative or discouraging
position on this medication.
The responses to these questions were nearly perfectly cor-
related with reported distribution of the SAMHSA clinical
guidelines; that is to say, states that actively encouraged
the use of buprenorphine were also those that encouraged
OTPs to inform clients about it, and distributed the
SAMHSA treatment manuals. Thus, we reduced these
three items to one measure for this analysis, namely,
whether the state agency actively encouraged the use of
buprenorphine.
All respondents were asked about any then-pending regu-
latory changes, in an effort to determine whether there
was variability in the amount of activity surrounding this
medication. Few states anticipated any forthcoming regu-
latory changes pertinent to the use of buprenorphine in
community-based treatment settings. The few pending
regulatory changes mentioned were procedural in nature,
for example, clarifying payment and approval processes
for prescribers and pharmacy boards. Due to lack of vari-
ation on these items, they are omitted from these analy-
ses.
Treatment Facility Data
To examine the impact of regulatory and funding policies
on the adoption of buprenorphine, data from a broad
variety of treatment programs across the U.S. is essential.
To ensure adequate representation of treatment programs
across states, the 2006 National Survey of Substance
Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) was used for analy-
sis. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the population of
facilities offering addiction treatment services in the U.S.,
conducted by SAMHSA. Although the N-SSATS is limited
in terms of potential predictor variables, it is nevertheless
the closest approximation to a census of the nation's treat-
ment providers. The public use data file for the 2006 sur-
vey was obtained from the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Data Archive [42]. The public use data file contains
no facility identifiers; however, codes for state, county,
and metropolitan area are included on each record.
The entire 2006 N-SSATS public use datafile includes
13,771 facility records. These records were filtered to
exclude facilities that did not deliver substance abuse
treatment services. Specifically, facilities were excluded if
they exclusively provided intake, assessment and/or refer-
ral services, along with those focusing exclusively on the
provision of services for persons arrested for driving under
the influence. Because our interest was in the adoption of
buprenorphine by organizations rather than individuals,
solo practitioners were also excluded from these analyses.
Finally, facilities operating in Puerto Rico and the other
US territories were excluded, because no data were col-
lected from their respective local government oversight
agencies about relevant regulatory and funding policies
for buprenorphine. These exclusions resulted in a final
data set of 12,236 substance abuse treatment facilities.
Measures
Several variables available on the N-SSATS file were
included as control or predictor variables in examining
patterns of buprenorphine adoption. These can be
grouped into three broad categories: ownership, facility
characteristics, and funding sources. Ownership is defined
in terms of three mutually-exclusive dichotomous varia-
bles: government-owned, private non-profit, and private
for-profit. Because studies have repeatedly documented
higher rates of pharmacotherapy adoption in for-profit
facilities, these are used as the reference category in the
multivariate model.
Facility characteristics include several variables that may
be associated with an organization's willingness or ability
to adopt medications. First, because hospital-based pro-
grams have the infrastructure to support the use of phar-
macotherapies, they may be more likely to adopt
buprenorphine. Facilities self-reported whether they were
located in a hospital (1 = yes, 0 = no). Next, because
buprenorphine is indicated for the treatment of opioid
addiction, opioid treatment programs (OTPs) may be more
likely to adopt it. Programs are coded as OTPs if they self-
reported this status to N-SSATS (1 = yes, 0 = no). Third, the
N-SSATS includes organizations that may vary in the pro-
portion of total activity devoted to addiction treatment,
ranging from self-contained specialty addiction treatment
programs and OTPs to units within general hospitals and
mental health centers. Organizations having substance
abuse treatment as their central focus are expected to be more
likely to adopt addiction pharmacotherapies such as
buprenorphine. This dichotomous variable is coded 1 if
the facility's primary focus is substance abuse treatment,
and 0 otherwise.
Because much of the early clinical research on buprenor-
phine has focused on its use in detoxification protocols,
treatment programs offering detox services may be more
inclined to adopt it. Programs self-reported whether they
offered detoxification among their array of services (1 =
yes, 0 = no). Buprenorphine provides community treat-
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:17 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/17

ment programs an option for treating opioid-dependent
clients without investing in the infrastructure required to
offer methadone maintenance services. While hospital
inpatient programs already have the resources necessary
to utilize medications, outpatient programs may be less
equipped to do so. To examine whether adoption rates
vary significantly by primary treatment modality, we con-
trol for whether the program operates on an outpatient-only
basis (i.e., does not offer hospital inpatient or residential
treatment services). At the time of the survey, the use of
buprenorphine with adolescent clients had not been thor-
oughly studied; as a result, its adoption in adolescent
treatment programs as of 2006 is expected to be lower
than in programs serving predominantly adult clients. For
the purpose of these analyses, N-SSATS facilities are clas-
sified as adolescent programs if at least 75% of their clients
were under age 18 on the survey reference date.
The use of pharmacotherapies and other evidence-based
practices are generally viewed as indicators of higher-qual-
ity treatment programs. Because accreditation is also a
widely accepted indicator of program quality, it is control-
led for in these analyses. Programs self-reported their
accreditation status to N-SSATS, and a dichotomous varia-
ble is used. Analyses also include a measure of the total
number of admissions to the treatment facility in the past
year, with the expectation that larger facilities will have
both the resources and customer base needed to support
the adoption of buprenorphine.
Upon its approval by the FDA, buprenorphine was widely
advertised as a viable option for the delivery of opioid
dependence treatment in rural and remote areas, where
patients lacked access to opioid treatment programs. To
examine its early diffusion in this regard, we include a
measure of geographic location. Specifically, N-SSATS indi-
cates the metropolitan or micropolitan area (if any) where
each facility is located. These have been reduced to a
dichotomous variable, where 1 = located in metro/micro-
politan area, and 0 = located outside these areas (i.e., rural
counties).
Three measures of potential program funding sources are
coded from the N-SSATS data file. The first is whether the
program receives any funds from federal, state, or local gov-
ernment sources. Programs receiving funding from public
sources are likely to be more influenced by state policies.
Receipt of such funds is reported as a dichotomous varia-
ble in N-SSATS, and is coded as such in these analyses. A
second N-SSATS variable indicates whether the treatment
program accepts Medicaid as a form of payment for treat-
ment services (1 = yes, 0 = no). A third funding-related
variable indicates whether the program has any written
arrangements with managed care companies (1 = yes, 0 =
no). This is included as an indicator of reliance on private
insurance, which is expected to be positively associated
with buprenorphine adoption.
Finally, the dependent variable in these analyses is a single
N-SSATS item indicating whether the program uses
buprenorphine (1 = yes, 0 = no). In separate questions,
facilities indicated whether they used Subutex and/or Sub-
oxone. An affirmative response to either item resulted in a
"yes" response on the buprenorphine adoption variable.
N-SSATS does not provide sufficient detail to measure the
extent of use within programs (e.g., the number of clients
receiving the medication, or the frequency with which it is
prescribed). In 2006, 11.4% of eligible N-SSATS respond-
ents indicated that they prescribed buprenorphine. Table
1 provides descriptive statistics for each of these N-SSATS
variables.
Multivariate Models
Logistic regression models were estimated to test the
effects of facility characteristics and state environments on
the likelihood of adoption of buprenorphine by commu-
nity-based treatment programs. Responses from the SSA/
SMA interviews were attached to the record of each treat-
ment program in the data set. As a result, programs within
the same state have non-independent observations on the
state environment variables; to account for this, the mul-
tivariate analyses were run using the survey ("svy") set of
commands available in Stata v8.0, with state as the pri-
mary sampling unit. This approach produces robust
standard errors and accounts for the effect of clustering
and stratification in survey sample designs when calculat-
ing variance, standard errors, and confidence intervals
[43].
Listwise deletion reduced the available N to 10,410 for the
regression models. The majority of missing values were on
the "past year admissions" variable. Facilities excluded
from the analyses were not significantly different than
those retained, either in their structural characteristics or
in their adoption of buprenorphine (data not shown).
Results
Estimates obtained in the multivariate logistic regression
model are shown in Table 2. The ownership variables
were significant predictors of buprenorphine adoption.
Both government-owned facilities as well as non-profits
were just over half as likely to have adopted buprenor-
phine relative to the reference category of private for-
profit treatment programs. In terms of facility characteris-
tics, both hospital-based programs and OTPs were twice
as likely as other facilities to have adopted buprenor-
phine, net of the other variables in the model. Programs
offering detoxification services were more than 7 times
more likely than those without detox services to have
adopted buprenorphine by 2006.

Several other structural characteristics were associated
with the use of buprenorphine. As anticipated, programs
serving predominantly adolescent clients were signifi-
cantly less likely to have adopted buprenorphine com-
pared to those serving adult populations. Accredited
programs were about one-third more likely to use this
medication, and it should be noted that this effect holds
even with hospital status controlled. Larger facilities were
also more likely to have adopted buprenorphine. While
the coefficient for this variable appears trivial, this signifi-
cant effect can be better appreciated by examining the
effects of a standard deviation increase in caseload size.
Specifically, each standard deviation increase in the
number of past-year admissions was associated with a
10% increase in the odds of using buprenorphine. Net of
the other variables, adoption of buprenorphine was about
72% more likely among programs located in metropoli-
tan (versus rural) areas.
The financial variables showed mixed effects on the odds
of adopting buprenorphine. Treatment programs that
received any government funding were about 25% less
likely than other programs to have adopted the medica-
tion. Conversely, programs having at least one managed
care contract were 60% more likely than other programs
to have been using buprenorphine in 2006. Whether a
program accepted Medicaid payments was not predictive
of buprenorphine adoption.
In terms of activity at the state level that was expected to
affect programs' prescribing behaviors, there were mixed
results. Programs located in states that were engaging in
activities to encourage the use of buprenorphine were no
more likely than programs in other states to have adopted
buprenorphine in 2006. However, the availability of cov-
erage for buprenorphine in state Medicaid plans had a sig-
nificant effect on program-level adoption; the odds of
programs offering buprenorphine were 8.5% greater in
states where this benefit was available to patients. In all,
the model explained about 36% of the variance in pro-
gram-level adoption of buprenorphine.
Discussion
These analyses are consistent with prior research indicat-
ing that a mix of structural, funding, and environmental
variables are associated with organizational-level deci-
sions to adopt pharmacotherapies. Structural variables
available in N-SSATS suggest that the early adopters of
buprenorphine were likely to be OTPs, along with facili-
ties offering hospital-based, inpatient and detoxification
services. These programs represent logical early inroads
for buprenorphine. OTPs are challenged to meet the
needs of opioid-dependent clients, and buprenorphine
provides an alternative to methadone. Likewise, clinical
trials showing buprenorphine to be effective for short-
term detoxification may have contributed to its initial
uptake among treatment programs offering detoxification
services. Community-based treatment programs may view

buprenorphine as a clinically effective and financially fea-
sible alternative to either medically managed detoxifica-
tion protocols or methadone maintenance options for
their opioid-dependent clients. Finally, inpatient and hos-
pital-based programs already have the medical infrastruc-
ture available to permit the use of pharmacotherapies,
and buprenorphine likely represents an incremental addi-
tion to existing medication-based approaches in these set-
tings, rather than a new line of services. As such, then,
these programs are logical early adopters for buprenor-
phine and are probably least influenced by state policies
and funding.
However, funding variables are also important in explain-
ing variation in the current use of buprenorphine in com-
munity treatment programs. Government owned and
government funded programs had significantly lower
odds of adopting the medication, whereas private for-
profit programs were most likely to offer buprenorphine.
While acceptance of Medicaid as a payment source was
not associated with the use of buprenorphine, coverage of
the medication by Medicaid was a significant predictor. In
this respect, states that were proactive in modifying the
Medicaid formulary to include buprenorphine appear to
have had a significant influence on program-level deci-
sions to make this service available to their clients.
Net of the other variables measured, however, a state sub-
stance abuse agency's general orientation toward
buprenorphine does not appear to have a measurable
effect on program-level behavior. States that actively
encouraged the use of buprenorphine (by distributing
clinical guidelines, encouraging clients to be notified
about the availability of the medication, and taking a sup-
portive stance toward the medication) were no more
likely to influence program decisions to adopt the medi-
cation than states with a less supportive approach. These
results seem to suggest that the tangible signs of support
for buprenorphine are most associated with the inclusion
of the drug on the Medicaid formulary. Without a reliable
source of payment for a measureable subset of clients
entering treatment, programs are constrained in their
choices of which services to offer. If clients will not be able
to afford the medication, programs are unlikely to adopt
it, regardless of the strength of the evidence base to sup-
port its use or the degree of encouragement from external
stakeholders.

Limitations
This study has several limitations that should be acknowl-
edged. In terms of our primary data collection, we looked
only at the actions and perspectives of the Single State
Agency or the State Methadone Authority regarding
buprenorphine, but not the activities of other related
agencies such as the state Medicaid office or state phar-
macy boards. Examining the activities of these partner
agencies as well as regional or county agencies or profes-
sional associations within states was beyond the scope
and resources of the study, but merits attention in future
research.
N-SSATS is useful for obtaining a general overview of the
state of the nation's treatment system, but the dataset nec-
essarily trades depth for breadth. There are few predictor
variables available to permit a meaningful understanding
of the organizational factors influencing the adoption of
evidence-based practices among treatment providers. Rel-
evant predictors of buprenorphine adoption might
include, for example, the number of physicians on staff,
the percentage of clients with a primary opioid depend-
ence diagnosis, and the percentage of clients with Medic-
aid as their primary expected form of payment. These
measures are not available in N-SSATS. In particular, the
lack of detail on client payment sources may have been
partially responsible for the non-significant coefficient for
the "accepts Medicaid" variable in these analyses. If a pro-
gram's decision to adopt a new pharmacotherapy is influ-
enced by clients' ability to pay, and if Medicaid is an
indicator of this, then the relevant predictor variable is not
whether the program accepts Medicaid, but the propor-
tion of clients who are dependent on Medicaid for pay-
ment. Inferring the likely importance of Medicaid for
populations served by public sector programs is not a sub-
stantial leap, but the N-SSATS data do not provide the
opportunity to explore this association in detail.
Finally, it should be noted that state policies and clinical
practice are both constantly changing. The findings pre-
sented in this article are a snapshot of an evolving process
as it appeared in 2006, and may not reflect current policy
or practice.
Conclusion
The adoption of pharmacotherapies in substance abuse
treatment has been relatively limited, despite the recent
approval of several new medications for alcohol and opi-
oid dependence. While a philosophical resistance to the
medicalization of addictive disorders may undergird
much of the slow diffusion, there are nevertheless identi-
fiable structural impediments to the use of pharmacother-
apies for addiction treatment. To the extent that these
barriers can be reduced by targeted policy changes,
patients' options for effective treatment services can be
greatly increased.
These findings provide empirical support for the common
perception that public sector clients are at a relative disad-
vantage in terms of access to state-of-the-art treatment.
These analyses, based on data from more than 10,000
treatment programs across the U.S. in 2006, show that
public sector, government funded programs are signifi-
cantly less likely to have adopted buprenorphine for the
treatment of opioid dependence. Programs in the for-
profit sector, and those with privately-insured clients, are
more likely to have adopted this medication. States that
have incorporated buprenorphine into the Medicaid for-
mulary have made inroads into closing this gap. It
remains to be seen what additional actions are needed to
further reduce these apparent disparities, as well as to
identify whether and how state-level activities have influ-
enced the adoption of other evidence-based treatment
options.
Based on these analyses, as well as corroborating anec-
dotes from the telephone interviews conducted with SSA/
SMA staff, it appears that most state oversight agencies
regarded the Medicaid formulary as the end-point for state
involvement in the diffusion of buprenorphine. While
our respondents indicated no discernible resistance to the
diffusion of buprenorphine in community-based treat-
ment programs, there was also little in the way of observ-
able behavior to actively promote its use, beyond support
for clinician training or educational opportunities.
Buprenorphine faces neither the regulatory challenges
associated with methadone, nor the barriers to diffusion
that limited the uptake of LAAM. While a sizeable percent-
age of treatment programs (11.4%) had begun using it
within the first three years of its availability, it remains to
be seen how much this new medication will continue to
penetrate the treatment system. Moreover, additional bar-
riers to the use of buprenorphine remain to be identified
at the client, clinician, program, and community levels.
More detailed analyses that compare the predictors of
adoption across the public and private sectors may yield
important insights, particularly if variables other than
insurance coverage show strong predictive effects in the
private sector, where the use of medications is considera-
bly more common [16,18]. An essential next step is to
determine which, if any, of those barriers are amenable to
change via revision of state or local policies or financing
processes, and then identify and disseminate effective sys-
tems change solutions.
