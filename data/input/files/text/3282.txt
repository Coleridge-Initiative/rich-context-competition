Heuristics and Political Elites'
Judgment and Decision-Making
Barbara Vis
Abstract
It is broadly assumed that political elites (e.g. party leaders) regularly rely on heuristics in
their judgments or decision-making. In this article, I aim to bring together and discuss the
scattered literature on this topic. To address the current conceptual unclarity, I discuss two
traditions on heuristics: (1) the heuristics and biases (H&B) tradition pioneered by Kahneman
and Tversky and (2) the fast and frugal heuristics (F&F) tradition pioneered by Gigerenzer et al.
I propose to concentrate on two well-defined heuristics from the H&B tradition--availability
and representativeness--to empirically assess when political elites rely on heuristics and thereby
understand better their judgments and decisions. My review of existing studies supports the
notion that political elites use the availability heuristic and possibly the representativeness one
for making complex decisions under uncertainty. It also reveals that besides this, we still know
relatively little about when political elites use which heuristic and with what effect(s). Therefore,
I end by proposing an agenda for future research.

Introduction
When taking decisions or making judgments (i.e. assessing situations that oftentimes
precede decision-making; Newell et al., 2015: 20), individuals regularly apply heuristics:
cognitive shortcuts or rules of thumb (see Gilovich et al., 2002). Much literature focuses
on the heuristics voters use, for instance, in their information search (Bartels, 1996;
Redlawsk, 2004) or preference formation (Bang Petersen, 2015). Compared to this large
literature that examines empirically the heuristics voters apply, the body of work studying
empirically the heuristics applied by political elites--for example, members of cabinet,

party leaders, or members of parliament (MPs)--is much more scant (exceptions include
Böhmelt et al., 2016; Jacobs, 2011; Kropp, 2010; Laver and Sergenti, 2012; Weyland,
2007, 2014).1 Political elites make judgments and decisions in an environment that differs
from that of ordinary citizens. Elites typically have more resources and support staff,
which may enable more accurate judgments and decisions (Jacobs, 2011; Weyland, 2014).
Political elites'motivation to arrive at an accurate judgment may also be higher, stimulat-
ing higher effort reasoning and a more systematic mode of processing (Jacobs, 2011).
Another, related difference is that ordinary citizens usually face too little information to
make a "comprehensively rational" choice (Gilovich and Griffin, 2002: 3), whereas polit-
ical elites regularly face too much information. A large majority (74%)2 of Belgian politi-
cians, for example, are overwhelmed by the information they receive on a daily basis
(Walgrave et al. 2013: 22), making it plausible that they turn to heuristics for managing
this complexity. It goes beyond this article's scope to explore the differences between
ordinary citizens and elites in more detail. Still, this possible difference is one reason to
concentrate on political elites' use of heuristics.
Various strands of literature on political elites'judgment or decision-making pay atten-
tion to some heuristic (e.g. Allison and Zelikov, 1999; Kingdon, 1989; Matthews and
Stimson, 1975). Because these studies vary substantially in how they define the term
heuristic, their findings are difficult to compare. Moreover, instead of empirically testing
whether political elites rely on heuristics, such studies typically assume (for instance,
because of incomplete information) that a heuristic has been employed. Establishing
empirically that political elites have used a heuristic instead of simply assuming that they
have is challenging (cf. Lau and Redlawsk, 2001).
Against this backdrop, my objectives are threefold. First, I address the lack of concep-
tual clarity by discussing two main traditions on heuristics: (1) the heuristics and biases
(H&B) tradition pioneered by Kahneman and Tversky (e.g. Gilovich et al., 2002; Tversky
and Kahneman, 1974) and (2) the fast and frugal heuristics (F&F) tradition pioneered by
Gigerenzer and his colleagues (e.g. Gigerenzer, 2001, 2015; Gigerenzer and Selten,
2001). While both traditions have their merits, I argue that two clearly defined,3 general-
purpose heuristics (Gilovich and Griffin, 2002: 3) from the H&B tradition--availability
and representativeness--are especially relevant to political decision-making. Knowing
more about the conditions under which political elites rely on these heuristics--which
underlie many others--4 will further our understanding of political judgment and deci-
sion-making. It does so because it helps to explain in the face of uncertainty which issues
or proposals are likely to reach to the political agenda (through availability). And which
ones are likely to be perceived as being able to solve the issue at hand (through repre-
sentativeness). My second objective is to bring together and discuss a selection of studies
on political elites' reliance on heuristics. Hereby, I focus mainly--but not exclusively--
on the availability and representativeness heuristics. This review shows that political
elites indeed rely on these heuristics, but also that we know very little about the condi-
tions under which a specific heuristic is used (except for the general finding that complex-
ity and uncertainty matters). The third and final objective is therefore to bring the
discussion forward by outlining an agenda for future research.
What is a heuristic? Different traditions, different answers
Heuristic is a broad term that, according to Shah and Oppenheimer (2008: 207), "has
been used to describe nearly everything." In the game-theoretic literature, for example, a
Vis 3
heuristic is defined as "a method or rule for solving problems" (Peyton Young, 2008: 1).
And in the agent-based modeling literature as "decision-making rules of thumb that can
in practice be very effective but can never be proven formally to be the best responses to
any conceivable state of the world" (Laver and Sergenti, 2012: 25). Political scientists
typically state that an individual employs a heuristic if she takes a decision based on any-
thing but full information. Because more information is always possible, "nearly anything
can be construed as a heuristic" (Druckman et al., 2009: 494). This not only makes what
is a heuristic unclear (cf. Shah and Oppenheimer, 2008) but also impairs the accumulation
of knowledge.
So, how to define heuristics? Who may be seen as the founding father of heuristics,
Herbert Simon (1990: 11), defines them as "methods for arriving at satisfactory solutions
with modest amounts of computation." The two traditions on heuristics mentioned above
each build on Simon's definition. Let me first discuss the traditions in some more detail.
The H&B tradition emphasizes how and why using heuristics typically results in judg-
ments or decisions that are suboptimal compared to a normative standard. This standard
is oftentimes expected utility theory (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944) or another
variant of comprehensive rationality theory (Gilovich and Griffin, 2002). The F&F tradi-
tion, conversely, is interested in how and why F&F heuristics regularly allow people to
make judgments or decisions that "fit" their environment and that are thereby ecologi-
cally rational (Gigerenzer, 2001; Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 2002).5 Limitations of knowl-
edge and computational capability need not be a disadvantage. In fact, these scholars
argue that if an environment is highly complex, using a heuristic may yield better deci-
sions. Another contrast is that much research in the H&B tradition assumes that heuristics
are used automatically and largely unconsciously, per dual-process theories of mind's
"system 1" reasoning (Kahneman, 2011; Kahneman and Frederick, 2002: 51­52;
Stanovich and West, 2000). The F&F tradition, conversely, generally assumes that heuris-
tics are employed consciously (Gilovich and Griffin, 2002: 16­17), more in line with
"system 2" reasoning.6
These characteristics are recognizable in the respective definitions employed. The
F&F tradition defines a heuristic as a strategy that ignores "part of the information, with
the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately than more complex
methods" (Gigerenzer, 2015: 112). Frugality plays no role in the H&B tradition. Instead,
the latter defines a heuristic as a substitution of an object's property with something that
comes more readily to mind. A heuristic mediates judgment when people assess "a speci-
fied target attribute of a judgment object by substituting another property of that object--
the heuristic attribute--which comes more readily to mind" (Kahneman and Frederick,
2002: 53, emphases in original). Such substitution clearly takes place in the availability
and the representativeness heuristics from the H&B tradition.
People employ the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973) when they
assess how likely it is that something occurs (e.g. a new party entering office) by focusing
on the ease with which they can think of occurrences of it (new parties that were success-
ful in entering office). For example, in Weyland's (2014) study on the spread of political
regime contention since 1848, the striking, vivid example of regime collapse in a neigh-
boring country (availability) positively influenced citizens' willingness to protest
themselves.
People use the representativeness heuristic when they assess to which degree phenom-
enon A (like population aging in Europe) resembles phenomenon B (population aging in
the Netherlands) (Kahneman and Tversky, 1972; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974).
4 Political Studies Review 00(0)
Statements such as "She will win the election; you can see she is a winner" (Kahneman,
2011: 150) indicate that someone relies on representativeness, same as when someone
judges "the potential leadership of a candidate for office by the shape of his chin or the
forcefulness of his speeches" (Kahneman, 2011: 150). Also, politicians who think nega-
tively about whole groups of people--for instance, Muslims--because of the activities of
some of them rely on representativeness.7
Political elites' reliance on heuristics and their effects
As noted above, in many studies on political elites' judgment or decision-making, heuris-
tics play some role. Such studies generally argue that political elites rely on a heuristic
when facing too many decisions (information overload), when the information is poor,
and in the presence of uncertainty (Sullivan et al., 1993: 978). These studies can be placed
in the bounded rationality literature (e.g. Jones, 2001; Simon, 1955). Examples include
Matthews and Stimson's (1975) study of the heuristics United States legislators employ
(see also Kingdon, 1977, 1989), studies on how elites use information in foreign policy-
making (e.g. Allison and Zelikov, 1999), and work building on Lindblom's (1959) notion
of policy incrementalism.8 Also in the economic voting literature (Nadeau et al., 2002;
Powell and Whitten, 1993; Whitten and Palmer, 1999), a decision-making shortcut is
identifiable on the side of political elites. Their assumption that voters vote economically
makes them try to change the economy for the better, for instance, by creating jobs or by
public investments that boost economic growth, especially shortly before an election.
Such behavior can give rise to political business cycles (Franzese, 2002). Except for the
general statement that political elites do seem to rely on heuristics, these studies' findings
are difficult to compare and accumulate given their different definitions of heuristics.
Moreover, as indicated, this work typically assumes instead of showing empirically that
political elites use heuristics. An exception to this last statement is Kropp (2010), who
aims to demonstrate German MPs' reliance on heuristics when they scrutinize European
Union (EU) policy-making. Kropp finds that MPs use a heuristic whenever they try to
reduce complexity, but it remains unclear how exactly she established this. To further the
discussion on political elites' use of heuristics, it makes sense to zoom in onto a selected
number of well-defined yet broad heuristics that are especially useful for political judg-
ment and decision-making. Availability and representativeness are precisely that.
Do political elites employ the availability heuristic?
Let us first assess whether political elites rely on the availability heuristic. The short
answer is yes, they do. Focusing on leading policy makers in Latin America, Weyland
(2007) demonstrated that the readily availability of Chile's bold and novel pension sys-
tem put this model on their policy agendas. There were factors like geographic and tem-
poral proximity--that is, availability--that influenced the policy makers' decisions,
rather than a logical evaluation of which model would be best (see also Weyland, 2008).9
In his 2014-book, Weyland reconstructed the employment of the availability heuristic and
the representative heuristic during three key waves of democratic contention using quali-
tative sources like contemporary participants'reports, diaries and eyewitness accounts. In
personal communication, Weyland indicated that for operationalizing the availability
heuristic, he focused mainly on disproportionate attention, references, and the subjective
assignment of importance to a dramatic, vivid precedent (like the overthrow of the French
King in 1848). Simultaneously, he assessed whether there were no references to other
Vis 5
"objectively relevant" precedents (such as the revolutionary waves in the Italian states in
the same year). Through this approach, Weyland (2014) demonstrated that political elites
indeed rely on the availability heuristic. This finding is corroborated by the, to the best of
my knowledge, first quantitative study on the availability (and representativeness) heuris-
tics by Böhmelt et al. (2016). Böhmelt et al. found a significant, substantively important
effect of foreign incumbents' party positions on the policy position of >200 domestic
parties from 26 countries between 1977 and 2010.10 Importantly, their large-n set-up
allowed for testing what political elites did not rely on.
While Jacobs (2011) did not employ this term himself (contrary to Weyland and
Böhmelt et al.), also his study on the establishment on contributory pension schemes in
Germany, Britain, the United States, and Canada supports political elites' employment of
the availability heuristic. In Jacobs'account, this heuristic entered through policy makers'
prior causal ideas. He showed that the options considered were shaped crucially by what
was available.
Do political elites employ the representativeness heuristic?
The empirical evidence suggesting that political elites rely on the representativeness heu-
ristic is more mixed. Supportive evidence comes, for example, from Weyland (2007), who
demonstrated that leading policy makers' employment of the representativeness heuristic
explains why so many countries in Latin America followed Chile's pension reform; they
saw the Chilean success as representative of a larger set of reform successes (see also
Weyland, 2008, 2014). In personal communication, Weyland indicated that he identified
the representativeness heuristic in the qualitative material for his 2014-book (see above)
by looking for emphasis on similarities with a vivid, dramatic precedent and especially
through the claim "we can do this too!"Actors'assumption that such easy replicability was
possible was problematic because it downplayed or neglected differences in the political
situation. In fact, the latter resulted in many emulation efforts' failing. In Böhmelt et al.'s
(2016) quantitative analysis, the representativeness heuristic would have been at work if
the positions of foreign incumbents had influenced the positions of domestic parties of the
same ideological bloc. It that case, say the domestic social democratic party would have
adjusted its position to representative foreign incumbents, namely, social democratic ones.
However, Böhmelt et al. (2016) did not find a significant effect for the positions of foreign
incumbents of the same ideological block on a party's position and thus--contrary to
Weyland's qualitative analyses--find no support for the representativeness heuristic.11
In Weyland's work, there is a relationship between the availability heuristic and the
representative one, with the former shaping what is on leading policy makers' radar
screen and the latter subsequently shaping how they assess this material. While such a
relationship makes sense for a variety of political judgments and decisions, especially
regarding institutional change, it is not a necessity. For example, the absence of a co-
occurrence of the employment of these two heuristics is supported empirically by Böhmelt
et al. (2016), who found support only for the availability heuristic.
Under which conditions do political elites use the availability and
representativeness heuristics?
A perhaps more intriguing question is when political elites employ the availability and/or
representativeness heuristic(s). Broadly speaking, individuals--including political
elites--turn to heuristics when they face a high degree of uncertainty. Given that elites
6 Political Studies Review 00(0)
because of, for instance, their larger resources oftentimes face less uncertainty than do
ordinary citizens, the former's hurdle for relying on heuristics is higher. The difference
across political elites and ordinary citizens is one of degree, not of kind. Using a broader
definition of elite than I adopt here (see Note 1), Hafner-Burton et al.'s (2013) review
shows that elite decision makers use heuristics more effectively when processing com-
plex information, mainly because of their larger ability to choose with automaticity. This
finding supports the difference in degree not in kind notion. Also, political elites are
"normal mortals" (Weyland, 2014: 58, see p. 54), who turn to heuristics at some point,
namely, when the environment becomes highly uncertain and complex (see also Jacobs,
2011). This applies to many political judgments and decisions (see, for example, Bursens
et al., 2017). An example is a party strategist who needs to decide on the party's policy
platform; doing this "optimally" is impossible in a multidimensional setting (cf. Laver
and Sergenti, 2012). Or, a government that needs to decide whether to reform the welfare
state, or whether to participate in a military intervention. Such decisions are complex--
there are numerous factors to consider--and how they play out is uncertain. For these
types of decisions, political elites may thus rely on heuristics.
What are the effects of using heuristics?
What, then, are the effects of political elites'reliance on heuristics? In studies focusing on
voters' decision-making, it is regularly assumed that heuristics defined as information
shortcuts enable uninformed voters to make decisions as if they were fully informed (e.g.
Lupia, 1994; Lupia and McCubbins, 1998; Lupia and Matsusaka, 2004 see Kuklinski and
Quirk, 2000: 153). According to Lau and Redlawsk (2001: 952), this view on the positive
effect of heuristics is so pervasive "that we could probably refer to it as the new conven-
tional wisdom" (emphasis added). This literature tends to neglect the possible biases
relating to using heuristics (exceptions include, for example, Bartels, 1996; Lau and
Redlawsk, 2001). As Kuklinski and Quirk (2000: 166) note, by "viewing heuristics as
rational strategies for dealing with ignorance, political scientists have stressed how they
enhance competence"--in line with the F&F tradition. What they did not do is "looked
for problems with them" (Kuklinski and Quirk, 2000: 166).
The heuristics and biases tradition, conversely, has focused explicitly on biases in the
sense of deviations from comprehensive rationality.12 Reliance of the availability heuristic
biases attention in confirmatory ways (Jacobs, 2011: 249, see Lau et al., 1991: 671­672).
This is because of individuals' "tendency to seek out and remember dramatic cases or
becausethebroaderworld's tendencytocallattentiontoexamplesofaparticular(restricted)
type" (Gilovich and Griffin: 3). The media can function as a magnifier here, because of its
focus on what is newsworthy. The latter typically are vivid or dramatic events. What is
focused on may then not reflect voters' preferences (Miler, 2009). If attention bias results
in some groups' voices not being considered, because they do not or cannot bring across
their wishes vividly, this poses problems for democratic representation.
A bias that is associated with the representativeness heuristic that is particularly rele-
vant for political judgment and decision-making is base rate neglect, that is, failing to
consider how likely a phenomenon's occurrence in general is. Concretely, this leads to
drawing "excessively firm conclusions from small samples [...]" (Weyland, 2014: 8),
basing conclusions on (too) short time frames, or overlooking the role of chance (see
Weyland, 2008). Hereby, also relying on the representativeness heuristic may pose prob-
lems for democratic representation.
Vis 7
Interestingly, using heuristics poses no problem for democratic representation in the
F&F perspective. If using a heuristic may trump a more elaborate strategy (see Goldstein
et al., 2001, for a discussion of when and why simple (F&F) heuristics work), elites rely-
ing on heuristics may be good news for democracy. If, for example, anAmerican President
is an expert in foreign policy decisions, the first thing that comes to his mind--per F&F
take-the-first heuristic--probably produces a good decision. But this will be the case only
if this President is truly an expert in this area, since experience does not by itself leads to
superior (decision-making) performance (Ericsson and Lehmann, 1996: 276).
Where to go from here?
For understanding better political elites' judgments and decision-making, it is important
to know more of the heuristics they rely on. While the term regularly appeared in existing
literature, the conceptual unclarity about what is a heuristic (i.e. how to define the term)
impaired the accumulation of knowledge. Moreover, most extant studies assumed that
political elites used heuristics instead of demonstrating this empirically. To further the
debate, it is important to have conceptual clarity about what is a heuristic, establish what
is our current knowledge on political elites' reliance on heuristics, and indicate where we
should go from there.
I discussed two main traditions to heuristics--H&B tradition of Kahneman and
Tversky and F&F tradition of Gigerenzer and colleagues--both of which are identifiable
in political science research. I proposed that the H&B tradition's definition of heuristic as
a substitution of an object's property of something that comes more readily to mind is
most appropriate for examining political elites' judgments and decision-making.
Therefore, I zoomed in onto two H&B tradition: availability and representativeness.
Given the small-n nature of most existing studies (e.g. Jacobs, 2011; Weyland, 2008,
2014), it was unclear whether the results would travel to a larger set of cases. This made
Böhmelt et al.'s (2016) study so relevant, because it provided the first large-n evidence
that they do, at least for availability. When having to make complex judgments and deci-
sions with uncertain outcomes, political elites rely on heuristics. What the extant studies
did not offer--and which they admittedly were not aiming to offer--was a measure of
political elites' employment of the availability and/or representativeness heuristics. To
understand better under which conditions which political elites use which heuristic and
with what effect, such a measure would be extremely valuable. This measure would help
to answer a range of novel, substantive research questions. For example, does the reliance
on heuristics vary across types of political elites or by ideology? To what extent does the
media or the Internet influence political elites'reliance on heuristics, and has this changed
over time?
The increasing availability of relevant data and possibilities for analyzing such data
allows for developing large-n applications to answer these and related questions. Text data
would be a useful starting point for such large-n analyses. There are at least two options for
using these data: (1) to create a measure of heuristics' use by individual political actors
(e.g. a party leader or MP) and (2) to assess whether the behavior of, for instance, political
parties or governments indicates that they employ heuristics. For option 1, potentially rel-
evant text data include cabinet members' tweets, parliamentary debates (Proksch and
Slapin, 2015), and or party leader speeches (Schumacher et al., 2016). To arrive at a meas-
ure of an actor's use of the representativeness heuristic, for example, the text data can be
analyzed with (computer-assisted) text analysis tools to identify actor's references to
8 Political Studies Review 00(0)
something that signals a "we can do this too!" claim (such as a reference to success of a
sister party abroad or of a rival domestic party). For option 2, possibly relevant text data
include party manifestos (Manifesto Research on Political Representation project; Volkens,
2015), data on policy agendas collected by the Comparative Agendas Project (e.g.
Alexandrova et al., 2014, for the EU's policy agenda; John et al., 2013, for the UK's
agenda), and press releases (Klüver and Sagarzazu, 2015, 2016; Van der Velden et al.,
2017). Topic modeling, an automated method to identify topics in texts (Grimmer, 2010;
Grimmer and Stewart, 2013), can be used to identify the topics the political actors focus on
and hereby helps to establish whether they relied on heuristics. To arrive at a measure of
availability, for example, researchers need to establish that actors pay disproportionate
attention to a typically vivid or dramatic precedent or factor while simultaneously ignoring
(an)other--also, and perhaps even more, relevant--factor(s).Although they do not discuss
this themselves, two recent studies suggest that political parties use the availability heuris-
tic when drafting their party manifestos,13 with the state of the economy serving as what is
available--the "vivid" precedent (Greene, 2016; Williams et al., 2016).14
Text analysis allows for creating an indirect measure of political elites'employment of
heuristics. An underlying assumption here is that what political elites say reflects their
thinking--an assumption that may be wrong. Moreover, politics is subject to a process of
rationalization (Meyer et al., 1997). Text analysis should therefore ideally be comple-
mented by an approach that assesses elites' thinking more directly: experiments with
political elites as participants (cf. Fatas et al., 2007; Linde and Vis, 2017). Getting a sam-
ple of elites to run an experiment that has enough power is challenging, especially for the
most powerful elites. However, if such a sample can be obtained, the benefits are very
large. One route to conduct elite experiments is to use seminal, well-known, so-called
problems from the ample existing experiments on heuristics (see Gilovich et al., 2002, for
an overview). Another route is to conduct a conjoint experiment (Hainmueller et al.,
2014). In the latter case, existing findings on the factors invoking the employment of a
specific heuristic (such as vivid information invoking the availability heuristic) are the
starting point. These factors, including their absence, are then varied randomly and their
causal effect estimated by means of the conjoint analysis. The advantage of the latter is
that it allows for testing experimentally under which conditions political elites employ
which heuristic.15 Each of these routes could also be included in an elite survey. These
methodological ways forward can augment our understanding of political elites' reliance
on heuristics and thereby help to understand better political elites' judgment and
decision-making.

I adopt here.

 3. Scholars from the fast and frugal heuristics (F&F) tradition probably disagree with this statement (cf.
Kelman, 2011: 85).
 4. For instance, the representativeness heuristic subsumes the coalition-based heuristics (Adams et al., 2016;
Fortunato and Stevenson, 2013) and the party heuristic (see Lau and Redlawsk, 2001) that voters apply.
 5. This characteristic relates to the approach to heuristics in the game-theoretic and agent-based literatures.
 6. Also some heuristics and biases (H&B) researchers argue that heuristics can be employed consciously
(see Gilovich and Griffin, 2002: 5).
 7. This can be both a decision-making shortcut and a consciously invoked strategy to appeal to some voters;
the crux is how to establish which one it is.
 8. The latter strand of work typically studies bureaucrats instead of political elites.
9. Chile's bold pension reform was probably an inappropriate model to follow for many Latin American

10. Böhmelt et al. (2016) do not discuss their finding using this term.
11. Böhmelt et al. do not discuss their finding as evidence against the representativeness heuristic.
12. The existence of biases does not mean that applying the availability or representativeness heuristic is irra-
tional per se. As estimation procedures, heuristics are sensible (Gilovich and Griffin, 2002). Moreover, as
stressed by F&F scholars, while the employment of a heuristic deviates from comprehensive rationality,
it can still be ecologically rational. Whether applying a specific heuristic in a specific context is irrational,
and from which perspective, is an empirical question that is beyond the scope of this article.

14. Note that whereas Greene (2016) finds that when the economy grows, parties increase the attention to
their economic competence, Williams et al. (2016) find that governing parties pay more attention to the
economy in bad economic times (worsening unemployment and inflation; economic growth has a non-
significant, negative, effect).
