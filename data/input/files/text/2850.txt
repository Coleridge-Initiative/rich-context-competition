Abstract:
From a theoretical point of view, greater trade openness affects firm-level volatility by
changing the exposure and the reaction of firms to macroeconomic shocks. The net
effect is ambiguous, though. This paper provides firm-level evidence on the link
between openness and volatility. Using two novel datasets on German firms, we analyze
the evolution of firm-level output volatility and the link between volatility and trade
openness. We find that firm-level output volatility displays patterns similar to those
found in aggregated data for Germany. Also, smaller firms and firms that grow faster
are more volatile. Increased trade openness tends to lower volatility.
Keywords: firm-level volatility, trade openness

Non-technical summary
Greater openness to foreign trade has advantages. Countries may benefit from foreign
trade through lower prices and a wider range of goods. However, there are also fears
that greater openness may increase instability, say, because the country is more exposed
to foreign shocks. This paper uses firm-level data to analyze empirically the link
between trade openness and the volatility of real sales. A partial equilibrium model is
used to show that the impact of increased openness to trade on the volatility of output is
ambiguous. On the one hand, volatility may increase with the level of trade openness.
This is because firms which trade more react more to exogenous shocks than purely
domestic firms if their factor demand and supply schedules become more elastic. Also,
firms that trade more are exposed to domestic and foreign shocks. On the other hand, an
imperfect correlation between domestic and foreign shocks might have a dampening
impact on volatility. Hence, volatility may decline in the degree of trade openness.
The empirical analyses rely on firm-level data. Two new datasets on German firms are
employed. The first is taken from the corporate balance sheet statistics provided by the
Deutsche Bundesbank. The advantage of this dataset is that changes in the behavior of
firms can be analyzed over a comparatively long time frame, starting in the mid-1970s
and extending into the late 1990s. The second dataset is restricted to manufacturing
firms in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, but has the advantage of providing a direct
measure of trade openness.
The empirical analysis on the link between trade openness and volatility has three main
findings. First, there has been a relatively parallel pattern of firm-level and aggregated
volatility over the past three decades. This is in contrast to recent findings for other
countries such as the US. Furthermore, average level of firm-level volatility is higher
than the level of aggregated volatility. Second, regression analyses reveal that smaller
firms and firms which grow faster have higher volatility of real sales. Third, the
evidence suggests that exporters tend to have a lower volatility of sales than non-
exporters. This result is quite robust against changes in the specification, and in
particular against including proxies for the productivity of firms.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Eine größere Offenheit für Handel mit anderen Ländern hat viele Vorteile. So kann eine
Land durch niedrigere Preise und die Verfügbarkeit von zusätzlichen Gütern vom
Handel profitieren. In der öffentlichen Meinung wird aber auch die Befürchtung
geäußert, dass eine höhere Offenheit einer Volkswirtschaft die Instabilität erhöhen
könnte, etwa, weil ein Land auch anfälliger für ausländische Schocks wird. Dieses
Papier nutzt Firmen-Daten um den Zusammenhang zwischen Offenheit und Volatilität
des Outputs empirisch zu untersuchen. Zunächst wird ein partielles
Gleichgewichtsmodell verwendet, um zu zeigen, dass der Zusammenhang theoretisch
nicht eindeutig ist. Auf der einen Seite kann die Hypothese, nach der die Volatilität
durch eine größere Offenheit erhöht wird, durch zwei Wirkungskanäle begründet
werden: Erstens reagieren offenere Firmen stärker auf ausländische Schocks wenn z. B.
die Arbeitsnachfrage elastischer ist. Zweitens sind Firmen, die Handel treiben,
ausländischen Schocks in höherem Maße ausgesetzt. Auf der anderen Seite kann eine
geringe Korrelation von aus- und inländischen Schocks einen dämpfenden Einfluss auf
die Volatilität ausüben.
Die empirische Analyse des Papiers beruht auf Firmendaten. Zwei neue Datensätze
werden verwendet. Zum einen benutzen wir Daten aus der Bilanzdatenbank der
Deutschen Bundesbank. Der Vorteil dieses Datensatzes ist, dass Veränderungen im
Firmenverhalten über einen relativ langen Zeitraum, von der Mitte der siebziger bis
Ende der neunziger Jahre, hinweg untersucht werden können. Der zweite Datensatz
enthält nur Firmen aus dem Verarbeitenden Gewebe Baden-Württembergs. Er hat den
Vorteil, dass ein direktes Maß der Offenheit auf Firmenebene verfügbar ist.
Die empirische Untersuchung des Zusammenhangs zwischen Volatilität und Offenheit
beginnt mit der Darstellung einiger stilisierter Fakten. Es zeigt sich eine relativ parallele
Entwicklung der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Volatilität und der durchschnittlichen
einzelwirtschaftlichen Volatilität über die drei zurückliegenden Jahrzehnte. Dies steht
im Widerspruch zu aktuellen Untersuchungen für andere Länder, insbesondere für die
USA. Zudem ergibt sich, dass die Volatilität auf Firmenebene spürbar höher ist als die
gesamtwirtschaftliche. Eine Regressionsanalyse zeigt darüber hinaus, dass kleine und
schnell wachsende Firmen eine höhere Volatilität aufweisen. Weiter ergibt sich, dass
exportierende Firmen tendenziell eine niedrigere Volatilität aufweisen als nicht
exportierende Firmen. Dieses Ergebnis ist recht robust gegen Änderungen in der
Spezifikation der Schätzgleichung, und es bleibt insbesondere dann erhalten, wenn wir
ein Maß für die Produktivität der Unternehmen in unsere Regressionen aufnehmen.

Does Trade Openness Increase Firm-Level Volatility? *
1. Introduction
Does increased openness to foreign trade affect the volatility of output? Public
policy discussions suggest that globalization may increase uncertainty by raising the
volatility of output and consumption. Econometric work using aggregated or sector data
indeed shows that greater openness to trade may lead to increased output volatility
(Easterly et al. 2000, Braun and Larrain 2004, Kose et al. 2003).1 Hence, the recently
observed decline in output volatility across industrialized countries (see, e.g., Blanchard
and Simon 2001) cannot be attributed to greater openness but rather to smaller shocks,
better inventory management, or better monetary policy.
Studying the development of aggregated output volatility may mask important
differences across individual firms. If output across firms is imperfectly correlated and
if these correlations change over time, firm-level and aggregated volatility may even
develop differently. (See, e.g., Imbs (2003) or Comin and Philippon (2005).) For
individual households and consumers, in turn, it is the development of output volatility
at the firm-level rather than the development of aggregate volatility that matters. As
firm-level volatility increases, households must find channels of diversifying firm-level
risks and shielding their consumption patterns against fluctuations of output. This is one

1 In a recent paper, however, Cecchetti et al. (2006) do not find a significant impact of trade openness on
growth volatility across countries. Also, establishing a significant link between financial openness and
output volatility is difficult (Easterly et al. 2000, Razin and Rose 1994).

channel through which changes in firm-level output volatility can affect economic
welfare.2
In this paper, we provide evidence on the evolution of firm-level output volatility
for German firms. We employ two new firm-level datasets. The first is taken from the
corporate balance sheet statistics provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The advantage
of this dataset is that changes in the behavior of firms can be analyzed over a
comparatively long time frame, starting in the mid-1970s and extending into the late
1990s. The second dataset is restricted to manufacturing firms in the state of Baden-
Wuerttemberg, but it has the advantage of providing a direct measure of trade openness.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the issue of firm-level
output volatility using German data.
Our aim in this paper is two-fold:
First, we analyze whether patterns of firm-level output volatility in Germany
resemble those found in aggregated data. The evolution of aggregated output volatility
in Germany has differed from the patterns observed in other industrialized countries,
where volatility has been on a trend decline. Output volatility in Germany followed the
trend decline, but it increased temporarily in the period following re-unification
(Aßmann et al. 2006, Buch et al. 2004). We test whether similar patterns are found in
firm-level data.
Second, we analyze how increased openness to trade affects firm-level output
volatility. Despite the concern that globalization may increase uncertainty, little is
known about this link. Work by Ber, Blass, and Yosha (2002) provides one piece of
evidence that the degree of internationalization of firms affects their exposure to
domestic shocks. For Israeli firms, they find that more export-orientated firms react less
to monetary policy shocks than more domestically-oriented firms. The importance of
financial market development for firm-level volatility has been studied by Thesmar and
Thoenig (2004), who use a firm-level dataset of large French firms. They find that
financial market development and greater participation by foreign investors increase
2 An additional channel is the impact that volatility can have on growth. So far, the empirical literature
has remained inconclusive with regard to the link between growth and volatility (see e.g. Norrbin and
Ygit (2005) and the papers cited therein). While we will control for the impact of growth on volatility,
we do not discuss this issue further in this paper.
3
volatility. This trend has been reinforced by greater product market competition, which
could be taken as indirect evidence for a positive link between volatility and trade
openness. Recent research has also tried to explain differences in the evolution of firm-
level and aggregate output volatility. Comin and Philippon (2005) show that, for large
US firms, a declining aggregated output volatility has been associated with increased
volatility of output at the firm-level. (See also Comin et al. (2006) for evidence on the
labor market.) They also find that firm-level volatility is higher the more deregulated
markets are, the more firms invest in research and development, and the better their
access to debt and equity markets. Each of these variables may be related to increased
trade openness, but the effect of openness is not tested directly.
The finding that firm-level volatility of output has been increasing is mirrored by
an increasing degree of idiosyncratic risk in individual stock returns. Campbell et al.
(2000) use US stock market data and find that, between 1962 and 1997, there was a
positive trend in idiosyncratic firm-level volatility but no similar trend in industry or
market volatility. We are not aware of comparable evidence for Germany.
Studying German evidence on the link between trade openness and volatility is
interesting not only because volatility of output has increased temporarily due to
reunification. Germany is also one of the countries in the OECD with quite rigid labor
market institutions, and product market regulations are still relatively widespread
(OECD 2005). German firms might thus adjust differently to external developments
than firms from countries with more flexible institutional structures.
The starting point of our analysis is a partial equilibrium model which links output
volatility to trade openness. This model allows decomposing the impact of trade on
volatility into two components. The first is the volatility of aggregated shocks and the
correlation of shocks across countries. The second is the elasticity of factor demand and
supply, which determines the response of output to macroeconomic shocks. Both of
these parameters ­ the exposure to shocks and the reaction to shocks ­ are potentially
affected by a firm's degree of openness. (See Rodrik (1997) for a similar argument
concerning employment volatility.) We also review implications of open economy
general equilibrium models. The main hypothesis which can be taken from these models
is that (firm-level) output volatility might be higher for firms which trade more.
4
However, a counterbalancing effect comes through imperfect correlations between
domestic and foreign shocks and, thus, through diversification effects. Hence, the link
between trade openness and output volatility is ambiguous from a theoretical point of
view.
In Part 2, we derive testable implications from a stylized model of export
openness and output volatility. In Part 3, we describe our datasets and provide
descriptive statistics on the evolution of the volatility of firm-level output volatility.
Part 4 provides an empirical analysis of the determinants of volatility at the level of the
individual firm. Part 5 presents robustness tests based on data for the state of Baden-
Württemberg and sector data, and Part 6 concludes. Our results show that output
volatility at the firm-level ­ unlike in the US ­ displays patterns similar to those in
aggregated data. As regards the impact of export openness, we distinguish between the
effects of being an exporter per se and the volume of exports. We find that volatility is
smaller for exporters than for non-exporters. The volume of exports tends to have a
negative impact on volatility as well. Moreover, smaller firms and firms that grow faster
are more volatile.
2. A Simple Model of Trade Openness and Output Volatility
The openness of firms can have many dimensions. Firms can buy inputs from
foreign suppliers, sell their products abroad, and establish foreign affiliates for
production or sales. In this section, we define openness in a narrow sense as the share of
exports to total sales. Our aim is to show the channels through which export openness
affects the volatility of output. We begin by sketching these mechanisms in a simple
partial equilibrium model, and we briefly review the implications of open economy
general equilibrium models.
2.1 Exposure and Reaction to Shocks
Output volatility of domestic and of export firms can differ either because firms
are exposed to different types of shocks or because firms react to these shocks
differently. (See Barba-Navaretti and Venables (2004) for a more detailed discussion.)
As regards the exposure to shocks, foreign operations increase the volatility of output if
foreign shocks are larger than domestic shocks. A low correlation between domestic and
5
foreign shocks potentially counterbalances this effect as it gives rise to diversification
effects. As regards the reaction of firms to shocks, internationally active firms might
react differently than purely domestic firms as they can substitute domestic and foreign
inputs and customers more easily, because they might be less committed to a particular
location, or because their input and output elasticities differ.
Modeling differences in the exposure to shocks and differences in reactions to
shocks would require a full-fledged model of a multinational firm. To set the stage for
our empirical analysis below, we focus on a simple model of an export firm in a partial-
equilibrium framework.

Equation 5 shows that there are three factors affecting the volatility of output
7
First, domestic and export firms might react differently to shocks because their
elasticities of labor demand and supply differ.3 Several pieces of evidence point into this
direction. Work by Fabbri, Haskel, and Slaughter (2003) and Checchi, Barba-Navaretti,
and Turrini (2003) shows that the elasticity of labor demand tends to be higher for
multinational than for national firms. Slaughter (1996) finds, between 1961 and 1991,
demand for US production labor became more elastic while there has been no
significant change in the elasticity of demand for non-production labor. However, he
has difficulties in linking these patterns in the data to the openness of sectors. Rather, he
finds that "the time series of labor-demand elasticities are explained largely by a
residual, time itself" (p. 27).
Second, firms that export are exposed to domestic and foreign demand shocks and
to domestic technology shocks. Domestic firms, by contrast, are exposed only to the
domestic shocks. In our empirical model below, we include two proxies for domestic
shocks (the volatility of domestic government spending and the volatility of total factor
productivity (TFP)) and two proxies for international shocks (the volatility of oil prices
and the volatility of the real exchange rate).
Third, the correlation between domestic and foreign demand shocks affects the
exposure to shocks and, thus, the volatility of output. If shocks are imperfectly
correlated across countries, export firms might benefit from a diversification effect,
which dampens the volatility of output. To see this, we can decompose the term ( )

correlation between domestic and foreign demand shocks:

A similar relationship can be derived at the aggregated level. However, the
aggregate response might differ from the firm-level response because of differences in
the share of exports or a different covariance structure. (See Imbs (2003) for a related
argument concerning the link between volatility and growth.)
2.2 General Equilibrium Models
The model sketched so far highlights some key channels through which increased
exports of firms affect the volatility of output. However, we consider only a limited
range of macroeconomic shocks, and we ignore feedback effects between the domestic
and the foreign economy. These restrictions are relaxed in open economy general
equilibrium models.
Feedback effects between the domestic and the foreign economy as well as
implications of endogenous capital can be addressed in open economy real business
cycle models. Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) show that lower barriers to trade
increase the volatility of output. This is because the integration of markets allows agents
to shift production to countries that experience positive productivity shocks. The effects
of productivity shocks are thus magnified. Stockman and Tesar (1995) calibrate an
open-economy real business cycle model in which each country produces traded and
non-traded goods. They find a higher standard deviation of output and labor in the
traded sector than in the non-traded goods sector, which is driven by a higher variance
of productivity shocks in the traded goods sector. Also, elasticities of substitution might
differ for traded and non-traded goods sectors. Hence, the implication of these models is
that output volatility increases with the degree of trade openness.
The impact of different macroeconomic shocks on the volatility of output can be
analyzed with the help of a new open economy macroeconomic model. Senay (1998)
has a model which accounts for differences in the degree of openness to trade. Her
model combines pricing-to-market behavior and thus imperfect integration of goods
markets with the assumption of incomplete integration of financial markets. She finds
that greater integration of goods markets tends to increase volatility of output because of
9
an expenditure-switching effect of real exchange rate changes. This effect is largely
independent of the degree of financial market integration. The impact of monetary and
of fiscal shocks on the volatility of output is thus positive, and it is larger the more
countries trade.
2.3 Implications
Three main testable implications can be derived from these models
First, greater shocks to technology, shocks to domestic demand, and shocks to
foreign demand tend to raise the output volatility of export firms. Firms that sell only on
the domestic market are less affected by foreign demand shocks.
Second, imperfect correlations between domestic and foreign demand shocks
dampen the output volatility of export firms relative to domestic firms. The net impact
of openness on output volatility is thus ambiguous.
Third, firms that trade more might, ceteris paribus, react more to given shocks
than firms which are active only on the domestic market.
Our main testing equation thus links the volatility of output to openness and
aggregated shocks:

 = a measure of the openness of firms or sectors.
To measure volatility, we need to define a time window over which volatility will
be computed. Following earlier research at the macroeconomic level such as Blanchard
and Simon (2001), we choose a five-year window. This also corresponds to the typical
length of a business cycle. Hence, our dependent variable is specified as a moving
average process.
Analyzing the impact of macroeconomic volatility on firm-level volatility is
difficult because, by definition, macroeconomic volatility does not vary across cross-
10
sections. Hence, including a large number of different measures of macroeconomic
volatilities would artificially boost the significance of these variables, and interpreting
the effects separately would be difficult because of a relative high degree of colinearity.
Hence, we adopt two approaches. In a first model, we include time fixed effects which
capture the joint effect of different aspects of unobserved heterogeneity with respect to
time. This approach has the disadvantage though that we cannot simultaneously include
proxies for macroeconomic volatility. In a second model, we include measures of
macroeconomic volatility, such as the volatility of oil prices, the volatility of the real
exchange rate, the volatility of total factor productivity, and the volatility of domestic
government spending one-by-one. In this specification, we also add a linear time trend.
Note that we cannot directly estimate the effect of greater trade openness on the
reaction of different firms to macroeconomic volatility. This is because our estimated
coefficients do not allow disentangling the effects of openness on the elasticities of
factor demand. Hence, our testing strategy is indirect. We argue that differences in the
reaction of firms to macroeconomic shocks could be due to their degree of openness.
We cannot test whether different reactions are due to differences in factor demand and
supply elasticities, differences in the elasticities of product demand, or a combination of
these.
3. The data
Testing the predictions of the above framework requires firm-level data which
have a sufficiently large time series dimension ­ in order to capture the time-varying
nature of output volatility ­ and which provide information on the export openness of
firms ­ in order to capture cross-sectional differences in the openness of firms. We use
two datasets. The first comes from the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate balance sheets
statistics database (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik, UBS for short). This dataset has the
advantage that it covers a large cross-section of German firms for the period 1971-1998.
However, a shortcoming is that information on the openness of firms is patchy. Hence,
we use a second dataset which has information on export firms and domestic firms in
the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. This dataset has the advantage that it includes a direct
measure of the trade openness of firms. The disadvantage is its regional coverage and its
focus on manufacturing firms. Since these datasets are being used for an empirical
11
analysis of output volatility for the first time, we use the remainder of this section to
describe their main features.
3.1 Bundesbank Data4
The Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet database is the largest database of non-
financial firms in Germany. The data have been collected in the context of the
rediscounting and lending facilities conducted by the Bundesbank.
This restricts the cross-sectional dimension of the database, since only firms
which used these refinancing facilities are included, and it restricts the time series
dimension of the database, since rediscounting operations ceased with the introduction
of the euro in 1999.
In terms of sector coverage, the manufacturing, construction, and retail sectors
dominate the sample. This is because trade bills are an important source of external
finance in these sectors. According to Stoess (2001), the dataset comprises only about
4% of the total number of enterprises in Germany, but about 60% of the total turnover
of the corporate sector. Although the sample is non-random and therefore affected by a
possible selection bias, it tracks aggregated German GDP quite well. The correlation
coefficient between GDP growth and the mean growth rate of firms covered in the
sample was 0.89 over the sample period 1971 to 1998. Another advantage of this
database is that it comprises both incorporated and unincorporated firms. Hence, small
and medium-sized firms in Germany generally show up in our sample. In terms of the
time series dimension, we use data from 1971 to 1998 for most of the analysis. Owing
to changes in the sector definitions, the dataset has to be restricted to the years 1971 to
1995 whenever industry dummies are used.
Our main variable of interest is real sales. For this variable, we have relatively few
data losses owing to incomplete and inconsistent reporting. We convert nominal
variables into real variables by deflating each firm's sales with the deflator of real GDP
and taking the difference of the logarithm of real sales.
Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. On average, volatility of real sales
was 0.11 percentage points across all sectors during the period under study (1975-
12
1998). This is significantly higher than the volatility of aggregated output. However,
there is also a quite significant variation across sectors. Volatility was highest in the
construction sector (0.18) and lowest in utilities (energy, gas, water supply) (0.07).
The main disadvantage of the Bundesbank dataset is that it lacks consistent time
series information on the openness of firms. Thus, we measure trade openness using
sector information on exports and imports as a percentage of total value added. We
obtain this information from the OECD's STAN database. Generally, the database starts
in 1970. However, for the years 1970-1979, we have information for only 12
manufacturing sectors. For later years, we have more complete data, but there is
virtually no information on the openness of the services sectors. From these data, we
construct a measure of openness, which is given by the sum of exports and imports over
value added, and we also decompose this measure into export and import openness.
3.2 Data for Baden-Wuerttemberg
One shortcoming of the Bundesbank database is that it lacks detailed information
on the exports of each firm. Hence, we complement our empirical analyses by using a
second establishment-level data base from German official statistics. With respect to its
sector coverage, this dataset is limited to the manufacturing sector; with respect to its
regional coverage, the dataset is limited to a single German federal state, the state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg. In 2003, Baden-Wuerttemberg accounted for 13% of the German
population, 15% of GDP, and 16% of German exports. In addition, the state is host to
the largest and the seventh-largest German firms, i.e. Daimler Chrysler AG and Robert
Bosch GmbH.
Despite the regional and sector limitations, the data have two major advantages
over the Bundesbank data. First, they include firm-level information on export
4 See the data appendix for a more detailed description of the data.
13
openness. Second, the data comprise the total population of manufacturing
establishments in Baden-Wuerttemberg with a very good coverage of small firms.5
To create this establishment-level panel dataset, we use two sources of German
industrial statistics. The first data source contains information on all manufacturing
establishments with at least 20 employees and on establishments which are part of an
enterprise with at least 20 employees. These data are taken from monthly reports of
manufacturing firms. The second data source contains information from an annual
report of small manufacturing establishments covering all establishments with less than
20 employees. From these reports, a longitudinal dataset is created which includes all
manufacturing establishments in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the period
from 1980 to 2001. Although this panel dataset contains relatively few variables, it
comprises a large number of establishments, offers a high quality of data, and allows
tracking individual establishments over time.
With the help of these data, we can measure openness at the firm-level either
through a binary dummy variable indicating the exporter status (1 = export firm, 0 =
domestic firm) or through the firm's share of exports in total sales. Studying the
changing patterns of firms over a four-year time window shows that about 44% of the
firms in the sample remain purely domestic firms. Another 45% of the firms are
continuing exporters, i.e. they have foreign sales over the four-year period considered.
A similar share of 3-4% of firms are export starters and stoppers. The average exporting
firm is about larger and more productivity than the average non-exporting firm. This
confirms recent theories suggesting that productivity (i.e. size) positively affects the
probability of exporting (Melitz 2004). In our empirical model below, we will also
include size and productivity to isolate the impact of exporting.
To calculate the volatility of a firm's real sales, we apply the same procedures as
for the Bundesbank data. Nominal real sales are converted into real sales by deflating
each firm's sales with the deflator of GDP. We also use a 50% cut-off-point for the
growth of real sales to ensure that our results do not depend on outliers. As shown in
Table 2, dropping outliers and using only firms with a sufficiently large number of
5 Handcraft firms with fewer than 20 employees are, however, missing from the data.
14
observations needed to calculate volatilities implies changes in the composition of the
full and of the restricted sample.
Owing to a change in the classification of industries in 1995, we do not pool the
data. Rather, we present results separately for the period from 1984 to 1994 and for the
period 1995 to 2001.6
Descriptive statistics for the Baden-Wuerttemberg data are given in Table 1c. The
basic descriptive results derived from the Bundesbank data are confirmed using data for
manufacturing in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Differences between industries are substantial,
with volatilities ranging from about 0.10 in `Tobacco Products' and in `Food Products
and Beverages' to almost 0.18 in `Office Accounting and Computing Machinery' or
`Basic Metals' and more than 0.21 in `Recycling' in the 1995 to 2001 period. Compared
with the results from the Bundesbank data, the volatility of real sales is larger in the
manufacturing sector of Baden-Wuerttemberg. This might partly result from the fact
that the group of small firms is covered in a better manner in the data for Baden-
Wuerttemberg.
4. Empirical Results
Do firms that trade more exhibit higher output volatility than domestic firms? In
this section, we first present descriptive statistics on the link between openness and
volatility at the firm level. We proceed with regression-based evidence on the link
between trade openness and firm-level volatility.
4.1 Descriptive Statistics
Figure 1 compares the volatility of real sales at the firm-level to the volatility of
GDP, bringing out three stylized facts. First, the data show a downward trend in firm-
level volatility, which is interrupted by a high-volatility period around German
unification. A similar pattern is found in the data for Baden-Wuerttemberg. Second,
Figure 1 also shows a quite significant degree of heterogeneity across firms, indicated
by the relatively wide bands for the 10% and the 90% quantile. The magnitudes of these
differences are similar to those found in the US data (Comin and Phillipon 2005). Third,
15
firm-level volatility resembles patterns of aggregated volatility. In this regard, evidence
for Germany differs from evidence for the US, where firm-level volatility for large
firms and aggregated volatility have developed differently.
To check whether the time trend visible in Figure 1 is also statistically significant,
Table 2 reports results of a regression of firm-level volatility on a time trend. The
estimated equation is

ln where i = firm, j =
sector, t = time, and dummy is set at one for the three years following German re-
unification (1991-1993). Results reported in Table 2 confirm that there is a negative
trend in the volatility of firm-level volatility for German firms in the regressions
including the re-unification dummy. Running the same regression for each of the
industrial sectors separately shows that the negative time trend in output volatility is
common across sectors.
For 13 out of 20 sectors, however, we find a statistically negative time trend over
the full period. There are six sectors for which the time trend is insignificant (mining,
transport equipment, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and two services sectors).
For the full period, a positive time trend can be found for only one sector ­ electricity,
gas, and water supply. This finding is interesting insofar as the energy sector is also the
sector where the volatility of output is quite low.
Breaking up the sample into two sub-periods shows that the negative time trend
found in the full data is driven by the most recent years. The negative time trend in
volatility across sectors is confirmed in the state level data for the second sub-period
(1995-2001). In the first period (1984-1994), however, we find evidence for a positive
time trend in both datasets.7
How can we explain the recent downward trend in firm-level and aggregate
volatility? Trade openness is a possible candidate. Yet, over time, trade openness has
increased which, in itself, would imply a negative link between openness and volatility.
Between 1970 and 2000, the average ratio of exports over sector value added increased
from about 40% to 150%, imports over value added increased from 55 to 170%. Data
for Baden-Wuerttemberg confirm the positive trend in trade openness. Here, the average
6 Note that our data start already in 1980 but, due to the construction of the dependent variable, the
estimation period starts only in 1986.
16
firm-level export share (exports/total sales) increased from 10,9% in the period 1980 to
1994 to 13,3% in the period 1995 to 2001. Thus, at first sight, more trade openness
seems to be associated with less ­ rather than more ­ volatility.
Cross-sectional evidence shows that the link between trade openness and volatility
is rather weak (Figure 2). We distinguish between export and import openness. If
anything, there is a slightly positive correlation. Results are similar for the Baden-
Wuerttemberg data. Here, we do not find a significant cross-sectional correlation
between sector openness (measured as the sector export share) and sector volatility.
If anything, more trade seems to lead to less rather than more volatility. However,
we have so far ignored the role of macroeconomic shocks. If macroeconomic volatility
had declined, this could account for the fall in firm-level volatility, thus potentially
counterbalancing the impact of trade openness. All our proxies for macroeconomic
volatility (government spending, real exchange rate, total factor productivity, interest
rates) have indeed shown a downward trend. There are only two exceptions. First, the
volatility of government spending increased around the re-unification period. Second,
the volatility of oil prices has increased since 2000. Owing to data limitations, however,
this period is not covered by our regressions. Analyzing the impact of trade openness on
(firm-level) volatility thus requires disentangling it from the impact of the overall
reduction in macroeconomic volatility.
4.2 Estimation Issues
Our empirical model is based on Equation (8) above. This equation specifies the
effect of macroeconomic volatility on the volatility of firms' sales, controlling for firm-
level, sector, and macroeconomic factors. The explanatory variables at the firm level
and those at the sector level can contain variables that capture the firms' degree of trade
openness.
Due to the specification of our dependent variable, the residuals follow a moving-
average autoregressive process of order 4. By construction, our dependent variable is
thus serially correlated, and we have to take the autocorrelation structure of the residuals
into account. We follow Arellano (1987) and compute robust standard errors which
7 Note that a reunification dummy is included for both periods.
17
allow for both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of arbitrary form. Moreover, we
estimate dynamic panel models, including a set of up to five lags of our dependent
variable. However, for the firm-level data used, we had difficulties finding appropriate
instruments, and we could not reject the hypothesis of remaining residual
autocorrelation. Hence, we do not report these results here.
4.3 Regression Results
Table 3 presents the baseline regression results using the Bundesbank data. Panel
(a) presents results including a full set of time fixed effects, Panel (b) reports results
including proxies for macroeconomic volatility. In all equations, the volatility of real
sales at the firm level is the dependent variable. We show specifications which differ
with regard to the measurement of openness.
In column 1 of Panel (a), we use a sector measure of openness as the sum of
exports and imports of each sector over sector value added. In columns 2 and 3, we
break this measure down into exports and imports over value added. In column 4, we
additionally include the growth of real sales as an explanatory variable. In columns 5
and 6, we look at the response of the smallest and largest 10% of the firms in terms of
total sales.8 Here, the motivation is that small firms are typically active in only a few
foreign countries. Hence, the diversification effect would weigh less heavily than for the
larger firms.
All specifications show that it is difficult to establish a statistically significant link
between the openness of sectors and firm-level output volatility. The only exception is
the specification using data for the smallest 10% of firms. Here, the aggregated measure
of openness (imports plus exports) is positive and statistically significant at the 10%
level. Unreported regressions show that this effect is driven by export openness, which
is even significant at the 5% level. However, this positive effect is confined to the
smallest firms, which would be consistent with a lower degree of diversification of
these firms. For all other percentiles, we obtain an insignificant effect.
Splitting the sample into two time periods and dropping the re-unification period
essentially gives the same results. According to unreported regressions, all openness
8 Small and large firms are defined over the whole sample, not by sector.
18
variables are positive but insignificant in the first sub-period (before 1990). In the
second sub-period (after 1991), the openness variables tend to come in with a negative
sign, which is even significant at the 10% level for import openness. A possible
interpretation of this is that firms have increasingly diversified the set of countries with
which they trade, and are hence able to reap the benefits of diversification through low
correlations of shocks.
As regards the control variables, there is a clear negative correlation between the
size of a firm (measured as the log of its total sales) and the volatility of real sales.
Hence, real sales of small firms are more volatile than sales of large firms. This result
confirms prior expectations. Large firms, owing to more complex organizational
structures and greater potential for adjusting production across different plants, are
likely to exhibit lower volatility than smaller firms.
Another finding, which is robust across specifications, is that faster growing firms
are more volatile (column 4 of Table 3a). One interpretation is that growing firms are
active in less mature ­ and thus more volatile ­ markets than firms that grow less
quickly. Obviously, the reverse causality is conceivable as well ­ more volatility caused
by a greater intensity of search for new products and production processes may lead to
higher growth. Addressing the link between growth and volatility in more detail,
however, is an issue that we leave for future research.
In Table 3b, we report results for regressions including proxies for
macroeconomic volatility ­ which are identical for all cross sections in the sample ­
rather than time-fixed effects. We use the macroeconomic volatilities separately since
they are highly correlated. In addition, we include a linear time trend and a unification
dummy which is set at one for the years 1990-1994. With the exception of the volatility
of the real exchange rate, all proxies for macroeconomic volatility enter with a positive
and highly significant sign.
If we include separate measures of macroeconomic volatilities rather than time
dummies for each year, the openness variable becomes negative and significant in all
specifications (Table 3b). This shows that, at the firm level, it is difficult to disentangle
the impact of changes in the shock processes and of changes in the degree of openness
over time. Since openness is measured at the sector rather than the firm-level, it picks
19
up a significant amount of the time-varying nature of shocks. Hence, in Table 3b, the
openness variables pick up the effects of the macroeconomic volatilities that are not
included. As firm-level output volatility has tended to decline, macroeconomic shocks
have become smaller as well. This explains the positive sign on the macroeconomic
volatilities. At the same time, the openness of sectors has increased. Hence, the negative
sign on the openness variable could either be due to the fact that the macroeconomic
volatilities do not fully capture the time trend in macroeconomic shocks or that greater
openness has indeed been associated with lower volatility. We return to this issue below
as we look at firm-level evidence on openness.9
To check how the different ways to capture time trends affect our results, we also
re-estimate the baseline model without accounting for any time effects and including a
time trend only. In unreported regressions, we find that openness is negative and
significant in both sets of regressions. These results also do not depend on the measure
of openness used (imports, exports, or the combined measure). However, openness is
insignificant in the regressions including time fixed effects as the most flexible way of
controlling for time effects. This shows the difficulties in separating the effects of time
itself and openness in firm-level regressions using sector measures of openness.
We also check whether firm's leverage has an impact on volatility. However, the
effect is insignificant throughout.
In sum, we thus find little evidence for a strong and significant link between trade
openness and firms' output volatility using data for Germany as a whole. This, however,
may be due to the fact that we are not able to fully disentangle the impact of greater
trade openness at the sector level ­ which potentially increases output volatility ­ and
lower macroeconomic shocks ­ which potentially lowers output volatility. Both of these
potential drivers of firm-level volatility have a significant time trend, and we thus
cannot fully isolate their effects. Below, we therefore re-run our regressions using sector
data and firm-level data for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Both datasets provide
evidence on the degree of openness for each cross-section.
9 We have also re-estimated the regressions reported in Table 4b including an interaction term between
openness and volatility. While the macroeconomic volatilities remained positive and significant, the
openness variable became positive and significant. However, the signs of the interaction terms differed
across specifications without a clear economic interpretation. Since this is due to problems of
multicollinearity, we refrain from interpreting these results any further.
20
5. Robustness Tests
5.1 Data for Baden-Wuerttemberg
As a first test for the robustness of our results, we use firm-level data for the state
of Baden-Wuerttemberg. This dataset has the advantage of providing a more direct
measure of openness. It has the disadvantage that it covers firms only from one German
state. We now measure openness through the export share of each firm and a binary
dummy indicating exporter status. Since the sector classification has changed in the
mid-1990s, we present results for two non-overlapping sub-periods. Results are reported
in Table 4.
Starting with the results for openness, we find a negative relationship between the
export share and volatility for the first sub-period. The effect for the second sub-period
remains negative but becomes insignificant. The dummy for the exporter status is
negative and significant for the full period. The explanatory power of the model is
similar for the two sub-periods with an overall R² of around 0.16. Interestingly, this is
driven by the within R² in the first and the between R² in the second sub-period.
One explanation for the relatively consistent finding that exporter status and
volatility are negatively correlated could be that exporter status is related to size. Recent
theoretical work suggests that heterogeneity of firms with regard to productivity results
in different strategies with regard to internationalization (Melitz 2004). The least
productive firms stay domestic whereas more productive firms export. To control for
this possibility, we include a measure of labor productivity at the firm-level, which is
computed as annual real turnover of a firm divided by its average number of
employees.10 Labor productivity has a negative but insignificant effect on volatility in
the first period, but a strongly positive and significant effect in the second period. Most
importantly, including labor productivity does not change our main result for the
openness variables.
In unreported regressions, we check whether the results for the openness measures
depend on the way we measure macroeconomic shocks. Hence, we replace the time-

considerable margin of error in this dataset.
21
fixed effects with proxies for macroeconomic volatilities. While our results for
openness are not affected, results on the macroeconomic control variables are difficult
to interpret because of a high degree of colinearity between the individual series.
Volatility of total factor productivity, for instance, switches from being significantly
negative in the first sub-period to being significantly positive in the second sub-period.
Hence, we refrain from interpreting these results further. Importantly though, our results
for the openness variables are unaffected.
As regards the remaining control variables, we generally confirm the results using
Bundesbank data. Smaller firms and firms that grow faster are again more volatile in
every model estimated. Finally, neither the multi-plant dummy nor our proxy for the
R&D intensity of a firm's industry has a significant impact on volatility.
We additionally check the robustness of our results in two different ways. First,
we measure openness at the sector level as in the Bundesbank data, and we confirm the
negative impact link between export openness and volatility. Second, we include
separate dummies for continuing exporters, export starters, and export stoppers within
the four-year period for which the volatility is computed. Results show that the
continuing exporters drive the results. The link between this variable and output
volatility at the firm-level is consistently negative and significant. This result is partly
underlined by the fact that export starters seem to have a somewhat smaller output
volatility relative to the purely domestic firms. However, this effect is weakly
significant in only a few of the specifications. Export stoppers do not exhibit output
volatility that differs significantly from that of domestic firms.
5.2 Sector Data
Table 5 gives the results using sector data. In Table 5a, we present regressions for
the full sample, including time-fixed effects. In Table 5b, we include proxies for
macroeconomic volatility. Table 5a shows a positive impact of openness on output
volatility (Columns 1-3). However, splitting the sample into the period before and after
1991, as is done in Columns 4 and 5, shows a positive and significant impact of
openness only for the first sub-period. In the second sub-period, the coefficients turn
negative and insignificant. We report results only for the combined measure of openness
(export plus import openness), but the patterns are very similar for the two sub-
22
components. To some extent, this mirrors results for the (Bundesbank) firm-level data,
where we also obtain evidence of a negative link between openness and volatility for the
1990s. One potential interpretation could be that trade has become more dispersed
across countries and that firms have benefited from diversification effects.
Size (measured in terms of the log of real value added) does not have a significant
impact. Moreover, the positive impact of openness that we find for the full sample
depends on the measure of size used. If we use employment instead of value added,
openness is insignificant for the full sample.
As for the firm-level data, we also include all proxies for macroeconomic
volatility separately (Column 6b), and we replace the time fixed effects by a linear time
trend to avoid problems of multicollinearity between the macroeconomic volatilities and
the time dummies. We confirm a positive impact of macroeconomic volatility on sector
volatility for total factor productivity, government spending, and interest rate volatility.
However, the impact of real exchange rate volatility is negative, and the volatility of oil
prices is insignificant.
To check whether more open sectors react differently to macroeconomic shocks
than less open sectors, we further split our sample into sectors which have a degree of
openness above and below the median. In unreported regressions, we find the main
difference between the more and less open sectors with regard to the impact of
government spending. Volatility of less open sectors reacts positively to volatility of
domestic government spending, while government spending is insignificant for the
more open sectors. This would be consistent with our theoretical framework.
6. Summary and Conclusions
Greater openness to foreign trade benefits countries through lower prices and a
larger variety of goods. However, greater openness also creates fears that instability and
the exposure to foreign shocks might increase.
In this paper, we have taken a firm-level approach to study the link between trade
openness and volatility. Starting from a partial equilibrium model, we have shown that
the impact of increased openness to trade on the volatility of output is ambiguous. A
potential increase in volatility comes through two channels. First, firms that trade more
23
react more to exogenous shocks than purely domestic firms if their factor demand and
supply schedules are more elastic. Second, firms that trade more are exposed to
domestic and foreign shocks. This might increase volatility of output. However,
imperfect correlation between domestic and foreign shocks might have a dampening
impact on volatility.
We have tested the predictions of this model using two novel firm-level datasets
for German firms. Some results are robust across specifications.
First, stylized facts show relatively parallel patterns of firm-level and aggregated
volatility over the past three decades. In contrast to findings for other countries such as
the US, there is thus little evidence for diverging patterns of firm-level and aggregated
volatility. At the same time, the level of firm-level volatility is significantly higher than
the level of aggregated volatility.
Second, smaller firms and firms that grow faster have higher volatility of output.
Both of these results are consistent with expectations.
Third, exporters have a lower volatility of sales than non-exporters. Since we
obtain these results in regressions including size and productivity, the effect is indeed
driven by the openness of firms.
Fourth, the link between the volume of exports and volatility is negative as well in
the firm-level data. Results using sector-level data confirm that the impact of openness
on volatility is not robust across time and across specifications. If anything, we find
evidence of a positive link for some sub-periods, which is in line with earlier cross-
country evidence using aggregated data.
Overall, our results show that the evolution of firm-level volatility over time is
driven by two factors. First, trade openness has increased, thus affecting volatility
through a change in the exposure and the reaction to shocks. While the theoretical
predictions of this link have been inconclusive, the data suggest that the `diversification
effect' stemming from a low correlation of domestic and foreign shocks dominates.
Second, macroeconomic volatility has fallen, thus potentially lowering volatility on the
firm level. Better inventory management is an alternative interpretation for the decline
in firm-level volatility, but our data do not allow testing this hypothesis directly.
24
Finally, we note that the welfare implications of changes in firm-level output
volatility are not clear-cut. Our results show that firm-level output volatility in Germany
has tended to decline. Whether this lower volatility at the firm level led to a lower
volatility of wages, income, and ultimately consumption, and hence had positive
welfare implications, cannot be answered with the data at hand. Moreover, the impact of
firm-level output volatility on growth is left for future analyses. It is not clear a priori,
whether lower volatility at the firm-level has a negative impact on growth because the
process of `creative destruction' is moderated, or whether it has a positive impact
through lower uncertainty.

Data Appendix
Firm-Level Data
Unternehmensbilanzstatistik (UBS, Deutsche Bundesbank)
One of the new firm-level datasets that we use comes from the balance sheets of
German firms (Unternehmensbilanzstatistik) of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The
Bundesbank has collected the data when offering rediscounting and lending operations
on a strictly confidential basis. Section 19 of the Bundesbank Act (§ 19 BBankG)
stipulates that enterprises have to submit their financial statements to the Bundesbank in
connection with collateralized rediscount and lending operations. Under the provisions
of the Bundesbank Act, the Bundesbank was authorized to perform credit assessments
in line with its obligation to purchase and lend only bills of exchange, which fulfill
stringent eligibility criteria, such as backing by three parties which are known to be
solvent. Technically, enterprises submitted their annual accounts to the branch offices of
the German State Central Banks (Landeszentralbanken). These accounts were then
recorded electronically, audited, and evaluated for purposes of trade bill transactions.
Since the Bundesbank performed checks for logical errors and missing data in the
database as well as consistency checks and error corrections, the quality of the data is
quite high.
The data have been collected on a strictly confidential basis and can thus be used on the
premises of the Deutsche Bundesbank only. The dataset has been used frequently in
economic research. See, for example, Chirinko and von Kalckreuth (2002) and von
Kalckreuth (2003). For more details regarding the dataset see Stoess (2001).
Overall, the Bundesbank received around 60,000 annual accounts per annum. Since not
all firms submitted reports in all years, the panel of firms is unbalanced. More than 80%
of the enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises (SME's) with an annual
turnover less than 100 million DM, and more than half of the dataset consists of
unincorporated firms. Even though the number of rediscount lending operations
dropped sharply with the start of European Monetary Union at the beginning of 1999,
the Bundesbank continues to collect information on the credit standing of German
firms. However, eligible enterprises now submit their balance sheets to the European
Central Bank. Hence we use 1998 as the last year of observations.
The dataset does not contain information on merger events.11 Growth rates of real sales
may thus be inflated if two firms have merged during the period under study. To correct
for outliers, we follow Higson et al. (2002, 2004) and employ several cut-off rates, i.e. a
fraction of, say a ±50% growth rate, is truncated from the data.
From this database, we take the firms' total turnover as a measure of real sales. We
convert nominal into real variables by deflating the firm's sales with the deflator of real
GDP and taking the difference of the logarithm of real sales. We use the deflator of real
GDP rather than sector price indices since the latter are highly correlated.
11 As in other studies using firm-level data, the cut-off may also eliminate some newly founded firms as
well as firms going bankrupt.
29
Sector-Level Data
All sector-level data are taken from the OECD's STAN database. Data prior to 1991 are
for West Germany, data after 1990 are for united Germany. The industrial classification
used follows NACE Rev. 1.
Exports and imports: Exports and imports of goods at current prices in million euro
Value added: Value added at current prices in million euro.
Macroeconomic Data
Government spending: Real, seasonally adjusted government consumption. Source:
OECD Economic Outlook.
Interest rate: Short term interest rate. Source: OECD, Economic Outlook.
Oil prices: Source: OECD, Main Economic Indicators.
Real effective exchange rate: Source: Deutsche Bundesbank.
Total factor productivity (TFP): The change in total factor productivity is calculated as
 TFP =  Value Added ­ 1/3   Capital stock ­ 2/3   Employment. Data are taken
from the 60-industry database of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre
(http://www.ggdc.net/dseries/60-industry.shtml)
Volatility of the macroeconomic variables is calculated as the conditional variance. We
model the systematic component of growth in each variable as an AR(1) process and
estimate this process using rolling samples. See Carlino et al. (2003) for a recent
application to employment data.
