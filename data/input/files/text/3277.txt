A key strategy of the Thai government has been to help
"grass roots" level, community-based enterprises (CBEs)
promote their home-grown agricultural and handicraft prod-
ucts into larger, export-focused, small­medium enterprises
(SMEs; Foreign Office, Office of the Prime Minister, 2016).
These present-day Thai policies and programs are, however,
rooted to a much earlier, 1979 Japanese program called "One
Village One Product" (OVOP), which was started in Japan's
poorest prefecture (Oita) by Governor Morihiko Hiramatsu
which stressed the importance for locals to lessen their
dependence on government subsidies as well as help with
retainingyouthandimprovingthequalityoflife(Prayukvong,
2007; Thu, 2013). Governor Hiramatsu's motto was "Think
globally, act locally" (Prayukvong, 2007; Ramon Magsaysay
Award Foundation, 2016). Even the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) in 2008 released a
report committing itself to rural development and poverty
reduction in Africa using a OVOP-type project style
(Haraguchi, 2008), whereas other developing nations around
the world have adopted Governor Hiramatsu's vision.
The emergence of the Asian financial crisis in mid-1997
redirected many Asian governments to strengthen their
SMEs (Moha-Asri, 2002), with Thailand adopting Japan's
OVOP concept and implementing it in 2001 with a "twist,"
which in this case reversed the Japanese focus from bottom-
up initiatives to a Thai government­managed, top-down
driven scheme (Thu, 2013). Being relabeled in Thailand as
"One Tambon One Product" or OTOP (Kurokawa, 2009), the
Thai word "Tambon" is translated into English as "subdis-
trict," which is the third smallest administrative unit below
district and province in Thailand. Numbering 7,256 tambons
throughout Thailand (Hörstemeier, 2013), the program
exploded after its inception, growing from a little more than
US$7 million in 2001 to US$2.24 billion in 2008 (Figure 1),
with officials projecting nearly US$3 billion in 2016
(Changsorn, 2015).
With the OTOP program's explosive growth after its
inception (Figure 1), global confirmation of its importance
came as early as 2003 when in the 20-nation Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial SME Meeting

Thai Entrepreneur and Community-Based
Enterprises' OTOP Branded Handicraft
Export Performance: A SEM Analysis
Vipada Sitabutr1 and Paitoon Pimdee1
Abstract
Thailand's One Tambon One Product (OTOP) branded handicraft and food export program is expected in 2016 to reach
nearly US$3 billion, with products coming from approximately 6,000, five-star-ranked community-based and small­medium
enterprises countrywide. This study therefore examined influences of perceived quality, perceived price, trust, and satisfaction
on enterprise export performance using the OTOP product brand. Structural equation modeling used LISREL Version 9.1
to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis and test the hypothesized interrelationships on the variables' effect on export
performance. The vast majority of the entrepreneurs selected by simple random sampling either owned or worked in
groups that had 50 or fewer employees, which represented 472 of the survey's 500 respondents, or 94.4%. Additional
results indicated a high and positive correlation between perceived quality, perceived price, trust and satisfaction, and export
performance, with the most significant factor affecting export performance being customer satisfaction. In addition, perceived
quality also has a positive and direct effect on trust as well as on the exporter's customer satisfaction. Perceived price plays
a role as well and has a direct and positive impact on both customer satisfaction and a customer's trust of the exporter.
Perceived quality also affects export performance in a direct and positive way with trust having a direct and positive impact
on satisfaction.

held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, a ministerial statement was
issued proclaiming that Thailand's OTOP promotion "is a
good model that could have application in developing an
entrepreneurial society, especially in local areas."
During this period, it was the Thai Department of Rural
Community Development that was the coordinating office to
select the champion product at all administrative levels with
the selection criteria focused on (a) export potential, (b)
maintaining quality production, (c) high production stan-
dards which contributed to product quality and customer sat-
isfaction, and (d) the product's history (Prayukvong, 2007).
In addition, a rating system of one to five stars was imple-
mented with five stars necessary for export potential.
The government plays a supporting role as well, assisting
in supply chain issues, consultation with enterprise entrepre-
neurs, networking, and opening up new markets for the
OTOP products, which in 2016 has included 10 selected
OTOP products being sold on the national flag airline Thai
Airways with 128 OTOP products available through their in-
flight catalog ("Government cooperates with Thai," 2016).
In addition, OTOP shops are being established in each of two
national gas stations (PTT) in each province with OTOP fairs
and booths common throughout Thailand.
The basic idea of the OTOP scheme is to have each
Tambon (subdistrict) concentrate on one certain type of
product which is best suited for production in each subdis-
trict. Presently, approximately 40% of the Thai OTOP enter-
prises are engaging in food processing and handicraft
production, with a heavy concentration of the enterprises in
Thailand's Northern provinces. Three product categories
have recently been identified as export rising stars, which
includes processed foods and beverages, utensils, decorative
items and souvenirs, and cloth, apparel, and accessories
(Changsorn, 2015).
In research reported in 2015 from the Thailand
Productivity Institute, it was indicated that there were
approximately 70,000 OTOP enterprises registered country-
wide (Changsorn, 2015), and according to the Thai Interior
Ministry's Community Development Department, 10,000 of
these have been granted a "five-star" rating. It is the "five-
star" rating that qualifies the enterprise to export, and in
2015, 5,687 exporters were generating more than 100 billion
THB (US$2.88 billion) yearly in foreign revenue forThailand
(Changsorn, 2015).
Although the terms CBE, SME, and OTOP might at first
appear to be interchangeable, they are not. To make the
nomenclature even more confusing, in Thailand's bordering
neighbor of Malaysia, SMEs are often referred to as "micro-
enterprises" by scholars (Tock & Baharun, 2013).
Many CBEs and entrepreneurs have aspirations to become
SMEs, and one mechanism to achieve this is to market their
products under the Thai government product branding of
"OTOP." The brand personifies the perceived value (Tock &
Baharun, 2013), and by becoming an OTOP branded prod-
uct, many doors to foreign markets can open, which is cur-
rently growing at nearly 2% per year ("Know global-build
local fair," 2015; Mass Communication Organization of
Thailand [MCOT], 2013). This is also supplemented by a
large domestic market which has also been growing at a con-
stant annual rate of 13% over the past several years
(Changsorn, 2015).
Thailand for many years has focused on the development
and the sustainability of the rural regions and citizens, which
became official government policy with the release of the
Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan
(1997-2001) which included the King of Thailand's "Theory
of Economic Self-Sufficiency" (Prayukvong, 2007). In addi-
tion, community-based development can revitalize commu-
nity solidarity (Suindramedhi, 2016).
Recently, a new program called "From Hundred to
Million" has also been conceived which is designed to help
stimulate young entrepreneurs' creativity and innovation
("OTOP fairs generate 2 billion," 2015), which is actually
mirroring one of the main objectives of Governor Hiramatsu
OVOP concept in 1979. Further program incentives can be
found in Thai Commerce Ministry statistics which state that
Thai OTOP products now represent more than 10% of
Thailand's exports (MCOT, 2013). Further incentives for
entrepreneurs to join in OTOP branding of their products
include initiatives such as the OTOP Product Champion
(OPC) certification that aims to improve the quality of CBE
products (Natsuda et al., 2011).
Problem Statement
Innovators are, first and foremost, entrepreneurs (The World
Bank, 2010) with Thailand's CBE/OTOP entrepreneurial
enterprises critical to national economic health, with various
factors contributing to their export performance success
(Hirohata, 2013). In the past, Thai entrepreneurial agricultural
and handicraft exporters have experienced various challenges

in overseas markets, including customer confidence, trust, and
lack of product branding and identification (Kurokawa, 2010;
Piriyakul & Wingwon, 2011). Production capacity for export
purposes is a great challenge for developing nations, which in
turn influences the quality, service standard, and production
scale (The World Bank, 2010). Customer satisfaction with
goods and service are critical to export performance (Julian,
2003; The World Bank, 2010).
Literature Review
Multiple experts and studies were analyzed in the lead-up to
development for the variables for the study's hypotheses con-
cerning Thai entrepreneurial CBE/OTOP export performance.
Among these and most frequently mentioned were the CZ
(Cavusgil & Zou, 1994) and the export performance
(EXPERF) (Zou, Taylor, & Osland, 1998) models. The
authors, however, found the history of European SMEs as
discussed by the Dutch scholar Voerman (2003) particularly
interesting as well as the detailed analysis on export perfor-
mance from the Brazilian authors Carneiro, da Rocha, and da
Silva (2007).
Finding agreement, however, on what components actu-
ally contribute to a firm's export performance is complex
with confirmation of this difficulty coming from early
research from Aaby and Slater (1989) which conducted a
review of 55 studies on the management influences on export
performance from 1978 to 1988 and synthesized the findings
down to the independent variables environment, competen-
cies, firm characteristics (i.e., firm characteristics, firm capa-
bilities, and management characteristics), and strategy
(Voerman, 2003) which affected export performance. Madsen
(1987) also synthesized 17 export performance studies from
1964 to 1985 into 23 latent variables grouped into three cate-
gories, which were referred to as organizational performance
(O-performance), the structure and performance of its envi-
ronment (E-structure), and strategies (strategy).
Sousa (2004) later reviewed 43 empirical studies pub-
lished between 1998 and 2004 and noted 50 different opera-
tional aspects of export performance, whereas Leonidou
(2004), on the contrary, compiled data from 32 empirical
studies and identified 39 barriers to export performance of
small businesses.
Cavusgil and Zou (1994) in their model focused on larger,
U.S. organizations and how organizational performance was
based on the organization's profile; environmental aspects
including cultural and political/legal factors; management
factors including experience, education, and commitment;
and finally the product and where it is destined for. Although
a good model with many useful elements, the present study
is focused on very small, rural entrepreneurs and artisans and
therefore was not a "perfect" guideline to follow.
Zou et al. (1998) are also recognized for their EXPERF
model whose key dimensions for measuring export perfor-
mance include financial, strategic, and satisfaction. This scale
has been empirically validated in a cross-national study of
U.S. and Japanese exporters, as well as in a study of U.K. and
Australian exporters (Styles & Ambler, 1994), and a study of
British exporters, strengthening its value as a valid general-
ized export performance measure (Beleska-Spasova, 2014).
The literature does also suggest that export performance
is closely associated with the characteristics of the enter-
prise, including such things as the size, the age, and who the
entrepreneurs are, as in this study's case (Sinkula, 1994; Zou
et al., 1998). The research, however, did identify other stud-
ies concerning export performance which were focused on
smaller SME organizations. This included Styles andAmbler
(1998); Bartlett and Bukvi (2001); Leonidou (2004);
Leonidou, Katsikeas, and Samieec (2002); and Ogunmokun
and Ng (2004).
Styles and Ambler (1994) revised an earlier export perfor-
mance framework from Aaby and Slater (1989) and con-
cluded that it was the partnership and relationship factors
which had the greatest influence on export performance
improvement. Later, Styles (1998) refined Cavusgil and
Zou's (1994) model for use in the analysis of SMEs in
Australia and U.K. firms and determined that economic per-
formance, improvement of competitive position, future
expansion, and passive exporting were the keys to SME
export performance.
Research from Bartlett and Bukvi (2001) also focused on
SMEs and investigated what hindered their growth the great-
est, and strongly suggested that unless flexibly and deregula-
tion are embraced, there will be significant barriers to small
business growth. Ogunmokun and Ng (2004) explored
Australian SME export performance (companies with fewer
than 200 employees) but did so by comparing why some
SMEs had better success than others in export performance.
From these and other studies concerning theories about
export performance, a synthesis of the research led to the fol-
lowing observed variables being determined.
Perceived Quality (PQ)
According to an export marketing performance survey con-
ducted on Thai SMEs, one of the four factors determined to
have a significant contribution was product characteristics
(Julian, 2003). The three others included competition, com-
mitment, and the export market characteristics. Concerning
product characteristics, it was stated that concentration
should be focused on product flexibility, which meets the
need of the market, specifically cultural specificity and the
degree of uniqueness of the product.
Aaker (1991) discussed brand equity and indicated that
perceived quality as having five elements including reason-
to-buy, differentiate/position, price premium, channel mem-
ber, interest, and brand extensions.
Fornell, Johnson, Anderson, Cha, and Bryant (1996) also
felt that quality awareness was crucial, whereas Bei and Chiao
(2001) concluded that the most significant factor was the
4 SAGE Open
quality of goods. The World Bank (2010) has also indicated the
importance of solid infrastructure for norms, standards, and
quality control, which therefore assures the proper commer-
cialization of products for either domestic or foreign markets.
Similarly, Brown (2003) stipulated the necessity of prod-
uct and service excellence in perceived quality which corre-
sponds to research from Tsiotsou (2005) concluding
competitive comparisons as a key success factor. In addition,
Türkyilmaz and Özkan (2007) cited overall quality, product
quality, and appropriateness to usage purposes, including
customer service, and service quality as significant factors.
This is consistent with Moliner (2009), which discussed
corporate strategies and indicated that perceived value was
more important than quality. Other factors such as fulfilling
expectations, meeting customer's goals, and having positive
customer relationships are also significant (Tohidinia &
Haghighi, 2011). Product performance, conformance to
specifications, reliability, and durability are also applicable
(Agus & Hajinoor, 2012).
In addition, Wang and Tsai (2014) stated that outstanding
quality, reliability, and consistency are crucial elements of
perceived quality as well with Laosirihongthong, Teh, and
Adebanjo (2013), stating that a product's performance, its
conformance to specifications, reliability, and durability are
equally important. Chang, Kuo, Hsu, and Cheng (2014) cited
broader factors of information, service, and system quality.
Perceived Price (PP)
Dodds, Monroe, and Grewal (1991) indicated that perceived
price (PP) let to perceived quality which thus led to per-
ceived value. Bei and Chiao (2001) also indicated the impor-
tance of a reasonable price, whereas Moliner (2009) stressed
the importance of customer loyalty and perceived value. This
is consistent with Dai (2010), which also indicated that rea-
sonable pricing is important which was in agreement with
Wang and Tsai (2014).
In Thailand, Julian (2003) studied SME export perfor-
mance and indicated that price competitiveness in the export
market and product commitment as important factors in
export marketing success with Leonidou et al. (2002) in
agreement indicated that price flexibility and the ability to
offer lower prices (i.e., penetration pricing) were positive for
export performance.
Valvi and West (2013) in their discussion about E-loyalty
indicated that perceived value was a significant predictor of
satisfaction while price notably influenced e-trust develop-
ment. Perceived price is also defined as pricing that is com-
petitive or equal to competitors "pricing scales as well as
corresponding to market trends" (Rijkers, 2014).
Trust (TR)
In Thailand, Piriyakul and Wingwon (2011) felt consumer
trust toward a product brand played a critical role in
supporting sustainable corporate growth. Lo (2003) elaborated
further by indicating that trust consisted of integrity, benevo-
lence, ability, perception, and communication. Jin, Park, and
Kim (2007) highlighted trust in Korea as coming from a firm's
reputation. Brencic, Ekar, and Virant (2008) indicated that a
long-term orientation is a consequence of trust and relation-
ship commitment with Lin (2013) indicating that significant
and positive relationships were found between trust and satis-
faction, and between satisfaction and loyalty.
Furthermore, according to Moliner (2009), trust is defined
as being trustworthy, honest, and having a good reputation.
Stuart, Verville, and Taskin (2011), however, saw trust as
being built principally through supplier centric traditional
performance metrics such as delivery reliability and product
quality conformance.
Trust is also earned when performance meets expecta-
tions and comes from reliable products (Valvi & West, 2013).
To achieve trust, enterprises need to respond to a customer's
need, have honesty and sincerity, keep commitments, and
possess competency and effectiveness in their service deliv-
ery (Alsajjan, 2014). This is consistent with Chang et al.
(2014) which determined that for businesses to promote
trust, they must provide excellent service which is reliable
and delivered with good intentions and Rijkers (2014) which
found that trust is earned from firms being reasonable, fair,
and having appropriate services and price consistency.
Satisfaction (ST)
Zou and Stan (1998) found 50 papers published between
1987 and 1997, and from the seven categories measuring
export performance, satisfaction was a key element. Hill,
Jones, and Schilling (2015) stated that identification of the
customer's needs along with superior fulfillment of customer
satisfaction over rivals contributed to a competitive
advantage.
Anderson and Fornell (2000) divided customer satisfac-
tion into three determinants: perceived service quality, per-
ceived value, and customer expectations. Satisfaction can
also be defined broadly as a customer being satisfied with a
product or service (Bei & Chiao, 2001). In addition, Tohidinia
and Haghighi (2011) indicated that relationship quality had a
significant impact with customer satisfaction and that cus-
tomer satisfaction had a positive impact on repurchase inten-
tions, positive word-of-mouth, and customer's positive
feedback.
This is consistent with Türkyilmaz and Özkan (2007)
which conducted research in Turkey on Istanbul mobile
phone subscribers and determined that that these providers
with limited resources should focus on improving customer
satisfaction and customer loyalty.
Calvo-Porral and Lévy-Mangin (2015) indicated that both
service value and corporate image exerted the strongest
influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty. Dai (2010)
indicated that satisfaction can also be derived from a
Sitabutr and Pimdee 5
successful purchase decision which leads to happiness and
overall satisfaction (Tsiotsou, 2005; Vesel & Zabkar, 2010).
Export Performance (EP)
Bilkey (1978) determined that management quality is the
greatest single determinant of a firm's export success. This is
consistent with Ayan and Percin (2005) which determined
that export market success can also be determined by multi-
ple indicators including environmental factors such as for-
eign environments, managerial characteristics, and the firm's
marketing strategies.
Brown (2003) focused on market share, rapid growth, and
profit as components of export performance, yet Brencic
et al. (2008) defined export performance as profitability,
which is reflected in sale volume, rapid growth, global com-
petitiveness, strategic position, global market share, perfor-
mance satisfaction, and success with the export venture
which fully meets expectations. Export performance factors
are also determined by profit, return of investment (ROI),
revenue, total sales, market shares, sales growth rate, export
growth rates, or number of new customers (Abu-Jarad,
Yusof, & Nikbin, 2010).
This is consistent with Ural (2009) which demonstrated
that there is a positive impact of information sharing, stra-
tegic positioning, and performance on financial export per-
formance and satisfaction with the export venture. Stuart
et al. (2011) examined trust between supplier and buyer
firms as well as the impact that trust has on export perfor-
mance outcomes which included customer satisfaction,
market share, and profitability. This was similar to Agus
and Hajinoor (2012) and Laosirihongthong et al. (2013)
that emphasized the importance of market share, profit-
ability, sales growth, and market growth on export perfor-
mance (Table 1).
Method
Data Collection
From the 2015 Thai Exporter Directory Database from the
Ministry of Commerce's Department of International Trade
(DIP), 1,353 Thai OTOP handicraft exporters which were
listed were extracted. Starting in November 2014, phone
calls were placed to 720 enterprise entrepreneurs involved in
export of Thai handicraft- and food-related products. Upon
contact with these owners, the best method for sending the
export performance questionnaire was determined (post,
email, courier, etc.). Subsequent follow-up calls and emails
were made to those owners who had not returned the survey
in December 2014 and January 2015, with the completion of
the follow-up process ending in February 2015. From this
process, the targeted collection number was not achieved.
Therefore, 10 teams were selected and deployed to physi-
cally travel to the enterprises'location in May 2015 and gather
a completed survey. From this added level of collection, the
researchers were able to obtain 545 questionnaires. This repre-
sented a collection rate of 75.69% (545 of the original 720
enterprises identified). Subsequent quality control and audit-
ing of the responses eliminated 45 sets, leaving a final survey
response rate of 69.44% or 500 of the originally identified 720
enterprises.
Based on statistical sampling requirements for research
conducted for the U.S. National Education Association
(NEA), Krejcie and Morgan (1970) indicated that sample
sizes larger than 380 are unnecessary. Yamane (1967) and
Israel (1992) also have indicated that sample sizes beyond
400 are almost irrelevant as well.
Furthermore, during the period between March and May
2015, qualitative research was further conducted by use of
in-depth, semistructured, guided interviews with seven own-
ers and executives covering the following five topics:
1. Measurement of perceived quality.
2. Measurement of perceived price.
3. Measurement of trust.
4. Measurement of customer satisfaction.
5. Measurement of export performance.
For the study, Cronbach's alpha (Cronbach, 1951) was
used to evaluate the initial 30 samples which used a 6-point,
unipolar scale survey rating matrix with 5 indicating excel-
lent and 0 indicating no opinion. The value of alpha that is
considered acceptable ranges in value from 0 to 1 and may be
used to describe the reliability of factors extracted from mul-
tipoint formatted questionnaires or scales, with a reliability
score of .70 or higher being considered a reliable score by
many researchers (Hair, Hult, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2013;
Nunnally & Berstein, 1994). The correlation coefficient indi-
cated high reliability with a score of .953.
Quantitative Data Analysis
To determine whether the sample size of 500 exporters
selected by use of simple random sampling for the study
was adequate, the researchers further confirmed this to be
the case from previous researchers (Hair et al., 2013;
Schumacker & Lomax, 2004). The questionnaire used a
6-point unipolar scale with 5 indicating excellent and 0
indicating no quality (Krosnick & Presser, 2009). This was
similar to the export performance rating scale used by Pope
(2002) to measure small firms. Analysis of Thai owner and
entrepreneur export performance was conducted using
descriptive statistics including frequency, percentage,
mean, and standard deviation (Keengwe, Onchwari, &
Wachira, 2008).
From literature reviews, the following latent and observed
variables were analyzed for this study.
The study defined the hypothesized framework as shown
below and in Figure 2.

other types of education including 15 with master's degrees
(3.0%) and with the remaining 124 respondents representing
other or lower educational levels (24.8%).
Among the total 500 respondents, 440 respondents were
business owners, representing 88% of the total, with the
remainder 60 (12.0%) indicating "business executives" as
their title/position. Work experience was broken down into
those with 10 or more years' experience (231 or 46.2%),
those with 6 to 10 years of work experience (124 or 24.8%),
those with 1 to 5 years of experience (120 or 24.0%), and,
finally, the smallest group was those with less than 1 year of
experience (25 respondents or 5.0%).
The vast majority of the entrepreneurs surveyed either
owned or worked in groups that had 50 or fewer employees
representing 472 of the respondents (94.4%). This was fol-
lowed by 22 respondents (4.4%) working in groups with 51
to 100 employees, with only two of the total of 500 surveyed
working in organizations larger than 101 employees (0.4%).
In addition, the respondents are divided into 10 groups
according to their assets. The largest group was represented
by those with maximum assets not exceeding 5 million THB
(US$144, 400 on September 27, 2016) which had 216 mem-
bers (43.2%). This was followed by those who worked with
76 businesses (15.2%) with assets between 26 and 50 million
THB. Another group with 56 respondents (11.2%) had assets
between 51 and 75 million THB followed by 53 respondents
between 6 and 25 million THB (10.6%). Respondents with
assets between 76 and 100 million THB included 42 respon-
dents (8.4%); between 101 and 125 million THB, 21 respon-
dents (4.2%); between 126 and 150 million THB, 20
respondents (4.0%); between 151 and 175 million THB, nine
respondents (1.8%); between 176 and 200 million THB, six
respondents (1.2%); and, finally, the last group with assets
more than 200 million THB was just one respondent (0.2%).
The respondents were engaged in various forms of busi-
ness including manufacturing (151 respondents or 30.2%),
wholesalers (134 respondents or 26.8%), retail (125 respon-
dents or 25.0%), wholesale and retail (45 respondents or
9.0%), manufacturing and wholesale (35 respondents or
7.0%), and combined manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer
(10 respondents or 2.0%).
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
According to Magistris and Gracia (2008), to access the
measurement models, a CFA is used followed by structural
equation modeling (SEM) to examine the general fit of the
proposed model with data and also to identify the overall
relationships among these constructs. Wong (2013) indicated
also that for marketing research, a significance level of 5%, a

statistical power of 80%, and R2 values of at least .25 are
considered typical.
Standard modeling accepts the proposed model if the p
value is higher than .05 and if the 2/df ratio is smaller than 2
(Byrne, Shavelson, & Muthén, 1989) which is consistent
with Kline (1998) and Ullman (2001) which also indicated
that the relative 2 should be less than 2. It is also common to
display confirmatory factor models as path diagrams in
which squares show the observed variables and circles show
the latent concepts (Albright & Park, 2009).
In addition, another commonly reported statistic and a
potential mechanism for accommodating large sample sizes
may be to use the root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) as a measure of goodness-of-fit in SEMs (Chen,
Curran, Bollen, Kirby, & Paxton, 2008; and to measure the
discrepancy per degree of freedom (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
The Amos 22 user's guide suggests that "a value of the
RMSEA of about 0.05 or less would indicate a close fit of the
model in relation to the degrees of freedom" (Arbuckle,
2013). RMSEA values range from 0 to 1, with a smaller
RMSEA value indicating better model fit. Acceptable model
fit is indicated by an RMSEA value if recommendations for
RMSEA cutoff points have been reduced considerably over
the past couple of decades (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Perceived Quality (PQ)
Using SEM, the researchers specified the CFA model (Hox
& Bechger, 1998) where the Perceived Quality (PQ; Figure
3) is influenced by (PQ1) Best Quality, (PQ2) Excellent
Standards, (PQ4) Meeting Customer's Goals, (PQ5) Durable
Products, and (PQ7) Service Quality as shown in Figure 3.
From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 0.54, with a p
value of .764 and RMSEA of 0.000 which indicates an
acceptable fit with the model. This ensures that the observed
variables are sensitive to Perceived Quality (PQ) and are
suitable for further analysis.
Perceived Price (PP)
CFA of Perceived Price (PP) in Figure 4 shows the factors
(PP1) Reasonable Price, (PP2) Fair Price, (PP3) Acceptable
Price, (PP4) Competitive Market Price, and (PP5) Market
Trends. From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 0.06,
with a p value of .970 and RMSEA of 0.000 which indicates
an acceptable fit with the model. This ensures that the
observed variables are sensitive to Perceived Pricing (PP)
and are suitable for further analysis.
Trust (TR)
CFA of Trust (TR) in Figure 5 shows the factors (TR1)
Trustworthy, (TR2) Ability, (TR3) Judgment, (TR4) Product
Trust, (TR5) Integrity, (TR6) Honesty, and (TR7) Trust in
Promise. From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be
11.03, with a p value of .273 and RMSEA of 0.021 which
indicates an acceptable fit with the model. This ensures that
the observed variables are sensitive to Trust (TR) and are
suitable for further analysis.
Satisfaction (ST)
CFA of Satisfaction (ST) in Figure 6 shows the factors (ST1)
Overall Satisfaction, (ST2) Satisfaction With Goods, (ST3)
Exceeds Expectations, (ST4) Satisfied Service, (ST5)
Purchase Decision Satisfaction, and (ST6) Needs Satisfied.
From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 11.03, with a
p value of .273 and RMSEA of 0.021 which indicates an
acceptable fit with the model. This ensures that the observed

variables are sensitive to Satisfaction (ST) and are suitable
for further analysis.
From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 0.03, with
a p value of .986 and RMSEA of 0.000 which indicates a
good fit with the model. This ensures that the observed vari-
ables are sensitive to Satisfaction (ST) and are suitable for
further analysis.
Export Performance (EP)
CFA of Export Performance (EP) in Figure 7 shows the fac-
tors (EP1) Market Share, (EP2) Profitability, (EP3) Rapid
Growth, (EP4) Sales Volume, (EP5) Strategic Position
Growth, (EP6) Satisfied Performance, and (EP7) Global
Competitiveness. From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to
be 11.03, with a p value of .273 and RMSEA of 0.021 which
indicates an acceptable fit with the model (Table 2). This
ensures that the observed variables are sensitive to Export
Performance (EP) and are suitable for further analysis.
From the modeling, the 2 was indicated to be 6.43, with
a p value of .490 and RMSEA of 0.000 which indicates a
good fit with the model. This ensures that the observed vari-
ables are sensitive to Export Performance (EP) and are suit-
able for further analysis.
Rasch (1980) evaluated 2 statistics as a way of evaluating
fit of data to the model and indicated that a sample size of
500 has a 5% range of 0.91 to 1.09. The 2 value of 302.04
for the 109 degrees of freedom is insignificant. Thus, it could

say the null hypothesis that the model presented in the article
is a good fit with the data. The error statistics of RMSEA of
0.015 confirm that the errors of fit in the covariance matrix
are very low.
The p value of .101 in Figure 8 is higher than .05, which
shows that the criteria is a good fit with the empirical data
and with each factors weight higher than 0.50 represents a
latent recognition of the quality Perceived Quality to
Perceived Price, Trust, Satisfaction which results in Export
Performance in the construct validity of the variables and
empirical variables that could explain the variance of latency
as well. In addition, empirical variables enable to explain
variances of observed variables ensuring suitability for SEM.
SEM Results
The SEM results (Figure 9) showed that all models meet the
required criteria at 276.94 2 value, with 2/df (276.94/251) at
1.10, p value at .13, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) at 0.96,
adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) at 0.93, root mean
residual (RMR) at 0.031, RMSEA at 0.014, and CN at
542.74.
According to Hooper, Coughlan, and Mullen (2008),
items with low multiple R2 (less than .20) have been removed
from the analysis as this is an indication of very high levels
of error. This is confirmed by Hair et al. (2013) which indi-
cated that R2 values should be higher than .25. From Table 3,
GFI is indicated to be 0.96 which is the GFI. Traditionally,
an omnibus cutoff point of 0.90 has been recommended for
the GFI (Hooper et al., 2008). Values for the AGFI also
ranged between 0 and 1, and it is generally accepted that
values of 0.90 or greater (Figure 8) indicate well-fitting
models (Hooper et al., 2008). The AGFI for the study in
Table 3 is 0.96.
Hypothesis Testing
The results of the hypotheses testing are indicated in Table 4.
Discussion and Conclusion
Results from the study indicate perceived quality (PQ) has a
positive and direct effect on trust (TR) which corresponds to
research by Moliner (2009), Vesel and Zabkar (2010), Wang
and Tsai (2014), and Chang et al. (2014). Indications also
suggest that the higher perceived quality awareness is, the
more trust a customer has. This requires Thai CBEs/OTOP
handicraft and product exporters to focus on products with
excellent quality while also meeting production standards
that are suitable for customer needs, including durability and

good customer service. These factors highly influence a cus-
tomer's trust.
In addition, the results show that perceived quality (PQ)
has a direct and positive impact on satisfaction (ST), which
corresponds to research from e-study of Fornell et al. (1996),
Anderson and Fornell (2000), Bei and Chiao (2001), Tsiotsou
(2005), Türkyilmaz and Özkan (2007), Vesel and Zabkar
(2010), and Tohidinia and Haghighi (2011). This higher con-
sumer awareness translates into higher satisfaction which
means that exporters should focus on products with excellent
quality that meet production standards, and are suitable to
customer needs. Furthermore, products should be durable
and maintained through an excellent product service system.
These factors all have a significant influence over a custom-
er's purchasing decision.
Furthermore, the study showed that perceived price (PP)
has a direct and positive impact on satisfaction (ST) corre-
sponding to studies conducted by Bei and Chiao (2001),
Moliner (2009), Dai (2010), and Rijkers (2014). This
explains that the greater export customer price awareness
is, the higher satisfaction they have. Hence, the Thai export-
ers' customers expect reasonable and fair prices which are
competitive. There is also an indirect, positive factor from
the results which show that satisfaction (ST) delivered
through higher price awareness affects satisfaction (ST)
through trust (TR).
Perceived price (PP) was also shown to have both a direct
and positive impact on trust (TR) which was validated in pre-
vious studies from Moliner (2009), Wang and Tsai (2014),
and Valvi and West (2013). This proves that the higher export
customer pricing awareness is, the more likely they are to
trust the exporter. Hence, Thai exporters should ensure that
their products have reasonable and fair pricing which is
acceptable and competitive and corresponds to market trends
to promote trust among their customers.
Perceived quality (PQ) was also shown to have a direct and
positive impact on export performance (EP) corresponding to
studies conducted by Brown (2003), Agus and Hajinoor
(2012), Laosirihongthong et al. (2013), and Laosirihongthong
et al. (2013). This shows that quality awareness is an impor-
tant element for export growth. The analysis emphasizes that
Thai exporters need to promote high-quality products which
are suitable to their customer's needs. The products must also
be durable and serviced with excellent customer services.
These factors are all important to Thai export performance
(EP).
Trust (TR) was also shown to have a direct and positive
impact on satisfaction (ST) which corresponded to previous
studies from Jin et al. (2007); Sanayei, Shaemi, and Jamshidi
(2011); Chang (2012); Chen et al. (2008); Lin (2013);
Alsajjan (2014); and Rijkers (2014). Trust (TR) therefore
promotes customer satisfaction (ST), and focus needs to be
given on products that have good marketing potential, have
excellent quality, and are suitable to customer's needs. Thai
OTOP exporter's goals should be focused on promoting cus-
tomer satisfaction (ST) with both production and service,
which leads to better export performance (EP). In addition,
Thai exporters should promote satisfaction with purchasing
decisions, provide products suitable to consumer's needs,
and ensure overall customer satisfaction (ST) to enhance
their export performance (EP).
In addition, trust (TR) influences directly and positively
export performance (EP) which is similar to results of studies
conducted by Lo (2003), and Brencic et al. (2008) which
shows that trust (TR) influences export performance (EP)
with the greater a customer trusting the exporter, the higher
the export performance (EP) value becomes. As such, Thai
exporters should focus on high-quality, marketable products.
Trust (TR) leads to purchasing contracts, which leads to bet-
ter export performance (EP).
In addition, Satisfaction (ST) has a direct and positive
impact on export performance (EP) as indicated in studies
conducted by Ural (2009). As satisfaction (ST) levels
increase, the greater the positive impact on export perfor-
mance (EP). Thus, Thai exporters should aim to promote
product and service satisfaction. In addition, exporters
should help with their customers' purchasing decision by
providing products suitable to their customers' needs while
ensuring overall customer satisfaction.
Implications
1. Export sector success depends on properly designing
production to meet the needs and growth of custom-
ers which assures the exporters' strategic strength.
2. To achieve this goal, marketable products with clear
and proper positioning must be realized.
3. The most significant factor affecting export perfor-
mance is customer satisfaction which includes main-
taining proper production levels while maintaining
high perceived quality which is also a significant
factor.

4. Perceived quality involves product durability, prod-
uct quality, and meeting product standards.
5. Trust must be maintained between the customer and
the exporter, with the customer­trusting in the qual-
ity of the deliverables, the contracts, the scheduling,
and the production quotas.
6. Perceived Price is significant in that it must be com-
petitive, follows market trends, and is reasonable and
acceptable. As such, the exporters should monitor
their customer's satisfaction periodically.
