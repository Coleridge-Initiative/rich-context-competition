Objective. To examine the relationship between positive affect and subsequent functional disability in older Mexican
Americans with self-reported physician-diagnosed arthritis.
Methods. We conducted a 2-year prospective cohort study using a population-based sample of 1,084 noninstitutionalized
Mexican American subjects aged >65 years residing in 5 southwestern states. Measures included self-reported diagnoses
of various medical conditions, functional ability, body mass index, and ratings of positive and negative affect.
Results. For 937 subjects with arthritis who reported no limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) at baseline, 697
remained ADL independent, 84 became ADL dependent, 41 died, and 115 were lost to followup 2 years later. There was
a significant association between high positive affect (score  12) and reduced risk of ADL disability 2 years later,
controlling for baseline sociodemographic variables, medical conditions, and negative affect (odds ratio 0.46, 95%
confidence interval 0.22­0.94). There was an interaction effect between positive affect and sex, with positive affect having
a larger effect in reducing risk of ADL dependence in men than in women.
Conclusion. High positive affect was associated with lower incidence of ADL disability in older Mexican Americans with
self-reported physician-diagnosed arthritis. The strength of the positive affect is stronger in men than in women.

INTRODUCTION
Arthritis is the most commonly reported chronic condition
and the leading cause of disability among older adults in
the United States (1,2). The prevalence of arthritis is 5%
for the adult population and increases to 50% for those
aged 65 years (1,3). Women have a higher prevalence of
arthritis than men (2,4,5). The prevalence is similar for
non-Hispanic whites and African Americans, and some-
what lower for Asians and Hispanics (3,6).
Arthritis can lead to immobility and physical inactivity,
which in turn are risk factors for disability and mortality
(2,7,8). Studies have shown that disability is one of the
most significant predictors of poor health-related out-
comes in older persons (9­11). Older adults with disabil-
ity also have a higher risk for depression and institution-
alization (9,10,12). The annual direct cost associated with
arthritis is nearly 65 billion dollars (13). The estimated
annual costs for caring for disabled older adults is 80
billion dollars in the United States (14).
Several recent studies have suggested that positive affect
may reduce functional decline in older adults (15­17).
Positive affect entails a sense of emotional well-being and
an optimistic attitude toward life (15). High positive affect
reflects an individual's emotional relationship with his or
her environment, communicating qualities such as happi-
ness, personal satisfaction, optimism, and morale (18,19).
The measurements of positive affect and negative affect
have been shown to be relatively independent of each
other, and the 2 measures correlate with different personal
characteristics (20). Persons in a positive mood are likely
to engage in social relationships (21), to be optimistic
about their future (22), to cope successfully with stressful
situations (23), and to feel in control of their lives (23).
Among older adults, it has been shown that the presence
of depressive symptoms is associated with functional de-
cline, increased cognitive impairment, increased health
care service utilization, and poorer outcomes (24­26). De-
pression and its side effects have been studied extensively,
but there has been limited research on positive affect and
its consequences. Emerging studies have found that in-
creasing positive affect decreases the risk of stroke, coro-
nary heart disease, disability, and functional decline
(15,17,27,28). Because arthritis is a major predictor of sub-

sequent functional decline, we were interested in whether
a positive affect reduces the risk of functional decline in
older adults with arthritis. In this study, we used data from
the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiolog-
ical Study of the Elderly (EPESE) to examine the relation-
ship between positive affect and subsequent functional
disability in older Mexican Americans with self-reported
physician-diagnosed arthritis. We hypothesize that high
positive affect would be associated with less incident dis-
ability in older Mexican Americans with self-reported
physician-diagnosed arthritis.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Sample. Data are from the EPESE, a longitudinal study
of Mexican Americans aged 65 and older. The Hispanic
EPESE was modeled after previous Established Popula-
tions for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly studies
conducted in New Haven, East Boston, rural Iowa, and
North Carolina (29).
In the EPESE, subjects were selected from 5 southwest-
ern states (Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado, and New
Mexico) using area probability sampling procedures. In
the first stage, counties were selected if at least 6.6% of the
county population was of Mexican American ethnicity.
The second stage involved the selection of 300 randomly
chosen census tracts. The third stage involved the selec-
tion of 3 randomly selected blocks. For the third stage, 1 or
2 additional blocks were added to obtain at least 400
households within each sampling unit. The fourth stage
involved in-home assessments (up to 4 interviews per
household) on sociodemographic characteristics, psycho-
social factors, and objective and subjective health factors.
The sampling procedure assures a sample that is general-
izable to 500,000 older Mexican Americans living in the
southwest (30,31). The response rate at baseline was 83%.
In-home interviews were conducted in Spanish or English
depending on the respondent's preference.
At the baseline interview, 2,873 subjects were inter-
viewed in person and 177 (5.8%) by proxy. At the 2-year
followup interview (1995­1996), 2,167 subjects were rein-
terviewed in person and 272 (8.9%) by proxy. The analysis
reported below is based on 1,084 subjects with self-re-
ported physician-diagnosed arthritis who completed the
followup.
Arthritis. A prior physician diagnosis of arthritis was
assessed with the following question: "Have you ever been
told by a doctor that you have arthritis or rheumatism?"
Similar questions were used in the first and second Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (32). Re-
sponses were coded as "Yes" or "No."
Positive and negative affect. A 4-item positive affect
scale was formulated from the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (33). We had previously
identified 4 items that load into a single positive affect
factor (34); this result was also reported by Sheehan et al
(35). The 4-item positive scale is presented in Table 1. The
responses were scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. A
score of 0 corresponded to a response of rarely or none of
the time, a score of 1 corresponded to some or a little of the
time, a score of 2 corresponded to occasionally or a mod-
erate amount of time, and a score of 3 corresponded to
most or all the time. Scores were divided into approximate
quartiles (0­6, 7­9, 10­11, and 12) with higher scores
indicating increased positive affect. The 4-item positive
affect scale showed high internal consistency (  0.76).
Factor analysis by Krause and Markides (36) identified a
7-item negative affect scale from the CES-D (Table 1). The
responses were scored on a 4-point scale (0­3, ranging
from rarely or none of the time to most or all of the time)
with potential total scores ranging from 0 to 21. Of the
subjects, 25% scored 0 on the negative affect scale and
were given a value of 0; 75% scored 1 and were given a
value of 1. The internal consistency of the 7-item scale is
high (  0.91). The 4-item positive scale was weakly
correlated with the 7-item negative affect scale ( 
­0.32).
Functional disability. Functional disability was as-
sessed by self report with a modified version of Katz's
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale. The scale includes
5 items from the original Katz ADL scale (37) and 2 items
developed by Branch et al (38). The modified ADL scale is
one of the most commonly used measures assessing phys-
ical functioning in community-dwelling populations
(37,38). The 7 items of the ADL index are presented in
Table 1. Respondents were asked to indicate if they could
perform the activity without help, with help, or if they
were unable to do it. Disability was dichotomized as no
help needed versus needing help with or unable to per-
form 1 or more of the 7 ADLs.

Covariates. Baseline sociodemographic variables in-
cluded age, sex, marital status (married versus unmarried),
and education (8 years versus 8 years). A summary
medical conditions variable was created at baseline. The
summary measure included diabetes, heart attack, stroke,
hypertension, cancer, and hip fracture (range 0­6). The
body mass index (BMI) was computed as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared. Anthropomet-
ric measurements were collected in the home using the
methods and instructions similar to those employed in
other EPESE studies. Height was measured using a tape
placed against the wall and weight using a Metro 9800
measuring scale (Scale People, Beltsville, MD). Subjects
with a BMI  30 were categorized as obese (39).
Outcome. Incidence of disability was defined as a new
onset of any ADL limitation (needing help with or unable
to perform 1 or more of the 7 ADLs) at the 2-year followup.
Statistical analysis. Cronbach's coefficient alpha as-
sessed the internal consistency of the 4-item positive affect
scale and the 7-item negative affect scale. Correlation co-
efficient was used to test the association between the pos-
itive and negative affect scales. Univariate analysis esti-
mated the unadjusted odds of any ADL limitation at the
2-year followup interview for nondisabled subjects at
baseline. Multivariate analysis estimated the odds of any
ADL limitation at the 2-year followup for nondisabled
subjects at baseline as a function of positive affect, con-
trolling for demographic characteristics (age, sex, marital
status, and education), medical conditions, negative affect,
and BMI. Interaction effects were performed between pos-
itive affect and age, sex, education, marital status, medical
conditions, and obesity. All analyses were performed us-
ing the SAS System for Windows, version 8 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 3,050 noninstitutionalized older Mexican Ameri-
cans interviewed at baseline, 1,084 had been told they had
arthritis by a physician. Table 2 presents baseline charac-
teristics of this sample. The average age was 72.8 years and
70.7% of respondents were female. More than half of the
sample was currently married and 75.5% had 8 years of
formal education. The average number of medical condi-
tions was 1.1 (SD 0.9), 36.7% had a BMI  30 kg/m2, and
13.6% reported at least 1 ADL limitation. The mean posi-
tive affect and negative affect scores were 8.4 (SD 3.4) and
3.9 (SD 4.6), respectively.
Of the 937 subjects who reported no activities of daily
living (ADL) limitation at baseline, 697 (74.4 %) remained
ADL independent 2 years later, 84 (8.9 %) became ADL
dependent, 115 (12.3 %) refused to be reinterviewed or
were lost to followup, and 41 (4.4 %) were confirmed dead
through Epidemiology Resources Incorporated using the
Social Security Administration's Death Master Files and
reports from relatives.
Table 3 presents results of a univariate analysis predict-
ing odds of any ADL limitation at followup among subjects
who were not disabled at baseline. Subjects in the highest
positive affect quartile (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confi-
dence interval [95% CI] 0.25­0.95) and married (OR 0.63,
95% CI 0.40­0.99) were significantly less likely to report
ADL limitations 2 years later. Older age (OR 1.11, 95% CI
1.07­1.15) and number of medical conditions (OR 1.52,
95% CI 1.20­1.93) increased the odds of reporting ADL
limitations 2 years later.

Table 4 presents the results of a multivariate analysis
predicting odds of any ADL limitation at followup among
subjects who were not disabled at baseline, as a function of
positive affect score at baseline controlling for demo-
graphic variables, number of medical conditions, negative
affect, and BMI. There was a significant association be-
tween high positive affect (score  12) and reduced risk of
ADL disability 2 years later, controlling for baseline socio-
demographic variables, medical conditions, and negative
affect (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22­0.94). Positive affect was also
used as a continuous variable in a logistic regression
model and included the variables listed above. Each unit
increase in positive affect score at baseline (0­12) was
associated with a 9% decreased risk of reporting any ADL
limitation (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85­0.98).
A number of 2-way interactions were tested for positive
affect. The only significant interaction was positive affect
by sex (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00­1.37). Men who scored in
the top 2 quartiles (score  10) were significantly less
likely to report any ADL limitation at followup, control-
ling for demographic variables, number of medical condi-
tions, negative affect, and BMI. A nonsignificant relation-
ship between positive affect score and ADL disability was
observed for women (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The objective of this study was to assess the relationship
between positive affect and subsequent ADL disability in
older Mexican Americans with arthritis. We found that
higher scores of positive affect at baseline were associated
with a lower incidence of ADL disability 2 years later,
controlling for sociodemographic variables, prevalent ma-
jor medical conditions, and respondents' scores on the
negative affect questions of the CES-D scale at baseline.
It is important to note that the effect of positive affect on
ADL was independent of negative affect. In fact, control-
ling for negative affect in the overall sample had little
effect on the strength of association of positive affect with
ADL incidence. Bradburn and Caplovitz (40) and other
investigators (41,42) have argued that the absence of neg-
ative affect is not the same as the presence of positive
affect (18). Measures of positive and negative affect have
been shown to be weakly correlated with each other
(18,20,43) and share common correlates, such as physical
health.
Individuals with arthritis and high positive affect may
reduce their risk of becoming ADL disabled through dif-
ferent mechanisms. First, they may have healthier life-
styles and a better adherence to treatment regimens. Sec-
ond, positive affect may be a measure of an individual's
resilience in the face of stress and capacity to cope with
stress. Third, they may be able to cope with environmental
or physical stressors that lead to better maintenance of
physiologic homeostasis.
Escalante and del Rincon (44,45) have developed a
map of the disablement process in rheumatoid arthritis,
where they emphasize the influence of psychosocial fac-

Arthritis and Positive Affect in Older Mexican Americans 37
tors on the disablement process. Their proposed model
provides a framework to study factors that can prevent
disability. The model specifies stages at which disabling
factors, such as depressive symptoms, stress, self efficacy,
and coping, exert their influence on the disability process.
This may allow clinicians to broaden their understanding
of the disability process. Similarly, previous researchers
have demonstrated that high positive affect is a protective
factor against functional decline in older populations with
myocardial infarction and stroke (15,27,28,46) and is associ-
ated with increased survival in older populations (15).
Also, we found an interaction effect between positive
affect and sex, with positive affect associated with a larger
reduction in risk of ADL dependence in men than in
women. Additional studies are needed to replicate our
findings that positive affect is more protective against dis-
ability in men than in women.
Little is known about factors that allow individuals to
maintain positive affect in the face of disabling condi-
tions. More research is needed to examine the role that pos-
itive affect plays in the psychological adaptation to disease. It
is likely that the ability to maintain high levels of positive
affect enables individuals to persevere in the face of obstacles
and to recover more rapidly from illness.
Our study has some limitations. First is our reliance on
self-reported physician diagnosis of arthritis. This allows
for errors by both physicians and subjects. Diagnosing
arthritis in the elderly is particularly difficult because vir-
tually all older adults have radiographic evidence of de-
generative joint changes. The correlation among symptoms
(e.g., pain), signs (e.g., crepitus, swelling, joint instability),
and radiographic changes is also poor in those aged 65
years and older, compared with younger populations (47).
Thus, the determination of arthritis, particularly in epide-
miologic surveys, is always somewhat arbitrary. Second,
the association between positive affect and decreased risk
of subsequent disability is not necessary causal. It is pos-
sible that this association is due to some unmeasured
correlate of both. However, this association remained after
controlling for relevant factors.
Finally, our measure of positive affect is relatively
crude. Because positive affect encompasses such overlap-
ping concepts as happiness, self efficacy, personal growth,
optimism, autonomy, and morale, one could argue that it
would not be well represented by a 4-item scale (23).
However, this scale was relatively robust and an indepen-
dent predictor of future functional disability.
In summary, our results suggest that a high positive
affect is associated with lower incidence of ADL disability
among older Mexican Americans with arthritis. These find-
ings provide evidence indicating the importance of promot-
ing and helping older adults maintain a high level of emo-
tional wellbeing. The development of comprehensive
programs that include attention of emotional state may aid in
preventing disability experienced by older arthritis patients.
