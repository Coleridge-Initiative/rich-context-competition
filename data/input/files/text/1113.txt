associated with younger age at obesity onset in U.S.
adolescent offspring followed into adulthood. Obesity.
2007;15:2790­2796.
Objective: The objective was to test the hypothesis that
maternal obesity is associated with younger age of off-
spring's obesity onset.
Research Methods and Procedures: We used prospective,
nationally representative, longitudinal data collected across
Waves I (1995; 12 to 20 years), II (1996; 13 to 20 years),
and III (2001; 18 to 28 years) of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (N  14,654; 49% female).
Interval regression analysis was used to assess the associa-
tion between maternal obesity and age at offspring's obesity
onset (International Obesity Task Force BMI 30 equiva-
lent age- and sex-specific cut-off points for adolescents and
BMI 30 for young adults) using self-reported heights and
weights, adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, parental educa-
tion, and family income, accounting for complex sampling
design.
Results: The net effect of having an obese mother varied by
race/ethnicity and was associated with a significantly earlier
age at obesity onset (p  0.0001) for whites [ 8.1 year,
95% confidence interval (CI), 9.3; 6.9)], blacks ( 
10.8 years, 95% CI, 12.4; 9.2), Hispanics (  7.0
years, 95% CI, 9.2; 4.8), and Asians (  8.6 years,
95% CI, 13.3; 3.9). Earlier obesity onset (18 years)
was associated with increased severity at young adulthood
(mean BMI, 36.0  0.3 kg/m2) vs. onset after age 18 (mean
BMI, 34.4  0.2 kg/m2; p  0.0001). There were no sex
differences in the association of maternal obesity to age at
obesity onset.
Conclusions: Having an obese mother was associated with
earlier age at obesity onset across all race/ethnic groups,
particularly non-Hispanic blacks. Early obesity onset has
important health consequences because of its association
with more severe adult obesity.

Introduction
Offspring of obese parents are at risk for obesity because
of shared genes and shared environments. While most stud-
ies have investigated the risk of becoming obese given
parental obesity (1­3), few studies have examined how
parental obesity relates to the age at which offspring be-
come obese.
In the past 3 decades, obesity has tripled among U.S.
adolescents (4) and more than doubled among 20 to 39 year
olds, (5) with considerable variation by race/ethnicity (6).
As longitudinal studies have shown, a substantial amount of
weight gain occurs in the transition from adolescence to
young adulthood (6,7) with strong tracking from adoles-
cence into adulthood (8­11).
Adolescent obesity is associated with increased mortality
and morbidity related to a variety of chronic diseases later in
life (12­14). However, less is known about the long-term
health effects of age at obesity onset. Research suggests that
adults who became obese in childhood and remained obese
into adulthood are at higher metabolic risk than those with
adult-onset obesity (15). Furthermore, reversal of obesity
between childhood and adulthood is associated with de-
creased metabolic risk in adulthood (15).
In this paper, we use innovative statistical methodology
to investigate how maternal obesity influences the age at

the nationally representative, prospective National Longitu-
dinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).1 The Add
Health data span a lifecycle period of high obesity incidence
and include an ethnically diverse sample, which allows
comparisons by race/ethnicity over a period of risk. Further,
we explore the severity of obesity among those with earlier
onset obesity and among those with obese mothers.
Research Methods and Procedures
Survey Design
The study population consisted of 20,000 adolescents
enrolled in Wave I (1994 to 1995) of Add Health, a longi-
tudinal, nationally representative, school-based study of
U.S. adolescents in grades 7 to 12, supplemented with
minority special samples and collected under protocols ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board of the University
of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Wave II (1996) included
14,438 eligible Wave I adolescents who would be still
enrolled in high school during 1996, including dropouts,
measured between April and August 1996. Thus, older
youths who were high school graduates in Wave I were not
followed in Wave II. In Wave III, all Wave I respondents
were followed (regardless of participation in Wave II).
Wave III (2001 to 2002) included 15,197 eligible original
Wave I respondents, measured between August 2001 and
April 2002. Our final analysis sample included 14,706 re-
spondents (49% female) with relevant data across Waves I,
II, and III. In Wave I ages ranged from 12 to 20 years, in
Wave II ages ranged from 13 to 20 years, and in Wave III
from 18 to 28 years. Exclusions included pregnant females,
Native Americans (due to small sample sizes), few partici-
pants with outlying ages, and those missing relevant data.
The survey design and sampling frame have been described
elsewhere (16,17).
Body Mass
Height and weight were self-reported in Waves I, II, and
III and measured in Waves II and III during in-home sur-
veys using standardized procedures. We used self-reported
data from all 3 waves to maximize the sample size and to
have comparably assessed data across the waves. Although
there is a tendency for heavier individuals to under-report
weight, this phenomenon has little impact on the classifica-
tion of obesity using BMI. For example, obesity prevalence
based on measured vs. self-report at Wave II is 10.3% and
9.2% respectively, and 86.0% of participants were concor-
dantly classified. To deal with the discrepant obesity defi-
nitions for adolescents and adults, we used the International
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) cut-off points (18) to classify
adolescents. The IOTF reference is based on pooled inter-
national data (including four national U.S. surveys) and
links childhood and adolescent BMI centiles to adult cut-off
points of BMI of 25 and 30 kg/m2. For the young adult
population at Wave III (ages 19 to 26), we used the BMI
cut-off point of 30 kg/m2 (19,20).
Study Variables
Race/ethnicity was determined from adolescent and par-
ent questionnaires and categorized as Hispanic, non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, or Asian-American. Age
was calculated from date of interview and data of birth.
Maternal obesity status, parental education, and family in-
come were reported by parents in the parental home inter-
view.
Statistical Analysis
Our outcome variable was age at onset of obesity. How-
ever, we did not fully observe this response variable. In-
stead, we know only that the adolescent became obese
before the Wave I survey, or he or she became obese
between the waves of Add Health, or was not obese at the
time of the Wave III survey. We also know the exact ages
of the individual at the time of each of the survey. For
example, for an individual who is 17.5 years of age at Wave
I and obese, we know only that this person became obese
sometime before age 17.5. Similarly, if a non-obese indi-
vidual age 15.8 at Wave I is obese at Wave II at age 21.0,
we know that this person's age at onset of obesity falls
between ages 15.8 and 21.0. For a non-obese individual age
22.4 at Wave III, we know only that this person's age at
onset of obesity will be 22.4 years. Such data are called
interval censored data (21). For the purpose of our analysis,
the upper and the lower bound of age at onset of obesity is
tabulated for each individual in the study sample. Examples
of such tabulations are shown in Table 1. With these data,
our goal was to estimate, for example, a simple linear
regression model (additional covariates can be easily added)
Y  a
^0
 a
^1
(mother's obesity status)   (1)
where Y is the age at onset of obesity. For simplicity, we
assume that the errors are normally distributed. The regres-
sion coefficient 
1
is interpreted in the usual way as the
difference in the age at onset of obesity when the mother is
obese or not (represented by an indicator variable). The
model is estimated using the interval regression procedures
in Stata 9.0 (22), including survey procedures to correct for
multiple stages of cluster sample design and unequal prob-
ability of selection to ensure that our results were nationally
representative and that bias in estimates and standard errors
was reduced. Descriptive analyses use design-based, ad-
justed Wald tests to compare subgroup means. In our data,

8% of participants were already obese when they first
entered Add Health, and 82% were not obese when last
observed.
The outcome variable in the models is the age at which
obesity is first observed and the main exposure is mater-
nal obesity. We also tested, and found similar effects
when paternal obesity or obesity in either parent was used
as the main exposure. Since fewer cases were missing
information about mothers, we present results related to
maternal obesity only. Similarly, we tested models where
the main outcome variable was based on measured
weight and height from Waves II and III. Because the
results were not substantively different, we present anal-
yses based on the larger sample, which includes self-
reported data from Wave I. Control variables included
household income, parental education, sex, and race/
ethnicity. We tested for interactions of maternal obesity
with race/ethnicity and sex, and the non-significant (p 
0.10) maternal obesity-sex interaction term was ex-
cluded. Geographic region was tested but not included in
final models, given that its inclusion did not result in at
least a 10% change in the coefficient for age at obesity
related to maternal obesity. To illustrate the effects of
having an obese mother on age at which obesity is first
observed in offspring, we used coefficients from the
interval regression models to predict age at obesity onset
by race/ethnicity and maternal obesity.
Results
Descriptive Results
At baseline, the mean age of the sample was 15.8 years and
7.1% of males and 9.7% of females were obese (Table 2).
In earlier work, we documented the incidence of obesity
between Waves II and III to be 12.7%, which resulted in an
approximate doubling of obesity prevalence from Wave II
to III, with highest rates in black and Hispanic females (7).
Table 3 shows the percentage of respondents who became
obese before, vs. after, the age of 18 years, regardless of the
wave of measurement. A substantially higher proportion of
young adults with an obese mother became obese before age
18 (Table 3). Further, obesity was more prevalent overall
among those with an obese vs. a non-obese mother.

Multivariate Analysis Results
Coefficients from the interval regression model are
shown in Table 4. In the absence of any interaction with
maternal obesity, the regression coefficients represent the
difference in the age at onset of obesity between those with
obese vs. non-obese mothers. When a race-maternal obesity
interaction is included in the model, the net change in the
age at onset due to mother's obesity status is the sum of the
regression coefficients of the race/ethnicity, maternal obe-
sity and interaction terms. Whites with an obese mother
have an estimated age of obesity onset of 8.1 years earlier
than whites with a non-obese mother. Compared with
whites with a non-obese mother, blacks were estimated to
become obese 10.8 years earlier, Hispanics 7.0 years earlier,
and Asians 8.6 years earlier.
Implications of Earlier Obesity Onset and Maternal
Obesity
Judging by young adult body weight and BMI, the se-
verity of obesity is greatest among those with onset before
age 18 (regardless of the wave of measurement) and mater-
nal obesity (Table 5). At Wave III, mean weight was sub-
stantially higher among respondents who became obese
before age 18 and who had an obese mother (females: 13.3
kg higher; males: 6.7 kg higher) than those with onset after
age 18 and without maternal obesity.
Discussion
In a representative, longitudinal sample of adolescents
and young adults in the United States, we found that having
an obese mother was associated with younger age of off-
spring's obesity onset across all race/ethnic groups. This
relationship was particularly strong in non-Hispanic black
females. Our analysis also suggests that the combination of
having an obese mother and an earlier onset of obesity
translates into higher BMI and weight at young adulthood.
The impact of our findings for the population is substan-
tial. Our Add Health analysis sample represents 18.0

million 13- to 20-year-old students at public and private
schools in the U.S. and indicates that 1.6 million adoles-
cents became obese before the age of 18 years. A substantial
proportion (20%) of offspring of an obese mother became
obese before the age of 18 years, while only 6.5% of those
with a non-obese mother had early obesity onset. The tran-
sition from adolescence to young adulthood is a period of
high incidence and maintenance of obesity, with maternal
obesity playing a major role in observed age of obesity
onset.
Differences in the long-term consequences of early- and
later-onset obesity are not fully understood. While some
studies show increased risk of adult (vs. child) BMI on adult
risk of chronic disease (23­25), there is evidence that the
cumulative effects of long-term obesity may be more dele-
terious than later-onset obesity (13,15). In a southwestern
Ohio cohort followed over the full life cycle from birth into
later adulthood, Wisemandle et al. (26) found that starting at
age 4 and through adulthood, individuals with onset of
overweight (BMI 25) before the age of 25 years had
higher weight and BMI than those with later-onset or no
overweight. Early obesity in black adolescent females has
been shown to be associated with higher fasting blood
glucose levels and increased risk of impaired fasting glu-
cose in young adulthood (27). Further, preadolescent central
adiposity that continues into young adulthood was associ-
ated with young adult metabolic risk factors, such as ele-
vated triglycerides, glucose, and blood pressure (28). In
addition, weight gain after 2 years of age has been shown to
be related to impaired glucose tolerance later in life (29).
Offspring of obese parents are at high risk for obesity
themselves (30­32) due to the effects of both shared genes
and shared environments. There is familial aggregation of
physical activity and diet patterns, attributable to genetic
and non-genetic factors (33­41). Furthermore, those with
Class III or extreme obesity (BMI 40 kg/m2) have been
shown to have significantly heavier parents than those with
Class I or II obesity (BMI 40 kg/m2) (42).
Although our study is one of the first to look at the
combined effect of race/ethnicity and maternal obesity in
observed age at onset of obesity in a nationally representa-
tive, prospective cohort, our analytical strategy is not with-
out caveats. Our analysis assessed the age at which obesity
was first observed once participants entered the Add Health
study but was limited to the age distribution of the Add
Health sample. While left- and right-censoring allows pre-
diction of the age distribution not surveyed in Add Health,
we are limited in not having data across the full spectrum of

ages. The interval regression approach, like survival analy-
sis approaches, holds the assumption that all respondents
will become obese at some point up to infinity. Ultimately,
we rely on the distribution of available data (within the
studied age range) to predict probability of being obese
outside of the studied age range. In addition, interval re-
gression assumes normal error distribution. We think that
this is a tenable assumption because the normal error in our
case may be with low dispersion. We acknowledge that, if
a large proportion of the full population were never to
become obese, our parameter estimates might overestimate
the average time to obesity among those who become obese.
Further, while the absolute numbers might differ with other
distributional assumptions, it is highly likely that we would
still find the race/ethnicity differences and the relative ef-
fects of maternal obesity. The interval regression model is
specifically designed to address interval censoring and,
thus, is a well-suited methodological approach to take ad-
vantage of the strengths of the Add Health data.
The race/ethnic variation in this large, nationally repre-
sentative, prospective cohort observed during an understud-
ied age range with data from adolescent respondents and
their parents, provides an outstanding opportunity for as-
sessing these relationships. Another limitation is the use of
self-report data on height and weight. However, we con-
ducted separate comparative analyses using measured- vs.
self-report data and found that our results changed very little
with the use of measured height and weight. Similarly, we
used only data on maternal obesity but conducted separate
comparative analyses using paternal obesity, and both ma-
ternal and paternal obesity and again found that our results
changed very little depending on the measure used. To
maximize sample size and to use consistent measures, we
opted to use self-report weight and height data and data on
maternal obesity alone.
The public health implications of the trend toward earlier
onset obesity are substantial. The trend foreshadows higher
rates of diabetes and nutrition-related chronic degenerative
diseases, emerging at younger ages (43,44). Given that risk
seems to be higher in those with long-term vs. adult-onset
obesity and that reversal of obesity seems to protect against
metabolic risk, early identification and intervention to re-
duce obesity are likely to have major health implications.
