Abstract
Matching the identities of unfamiliar faces is heavily influenced by variations in their images.
Changes to viewpoint and lighting direction during face perception are commonplace across
yaw and pitch axes and can result in dramatic image differences. We report two experiments
that, for the first time, factorially investigate the combined effects of lighting and view angle on
matching performance for unfamiliar faces. The use of three-dimensional head models allowed
control of both lighting and viewpoint. We found viewpoint effects in the yaw axis with little to no
effect of lighting. However, for rotations about the pitch axis, there were both viewpoint and
lighting effects and these interacted where lighting effects were found only for front views and
views from below. The pattern of effects was similar regardless of whether view variation
occurred as a result of head (Experiment 1) or camera (Experiment 2) suggesting that face
matching is not purely image based. Along with face inversion effects in Experiment 1, the
results of this study suggest that face perception is based on shape and surface information and
draws on implicit knowledge of upright faces and ecological (top) lighting conditions.

Introduction
The image of a face is not only determined by its shape and reflectance but also by the
directions from which it is viewed and lit. Rotations of viewpoint result in occlusion and
accretion of facial features and surfaces as well as changes to the shape of the face's outline.

A profile view, for example, has one less eye, eyebrow and cheek compared with a front view,
but that view provides information regarding the protuberance of the nose not directly
available from a front view. The appearance of a face can change at least as dramatically
with changes in lighting direction. Indeed, Adini, Moses, and Ullman (1997) made objective
comparisons of face images rendered under various viewing conditions and demonstrated
that changes in lighting accounted for greater image variance than changes in viewpoint (and
that both accounted for greater image variance than changes in identity). Extrinsic factors
such as viewpoint and lighting direction together with the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D)
shape and surface reflectance properties of a face determine the pattern of shading and
shadows, as well as the surfaces of a face that are visible (Hill & Bruce, 1996; Liu, Collin,
& Chaudhuri, 2000). Successfully isolating the intrinsic information that allows us to
discriminate identity is a major challenge for any visual system. In this study, we
investigate how viewpoint and lighting together impact the processing of this intrinsic,
identity-specific face information using a sequential matching task with unfamiliar faces.
While matching faces across changes in images is a challenge (Moses, Ullman, & Edelman,
1996), it is one that the human visual system is generally very good at solving for familiar
faces (Hancock, Bruce, & Burton, 2000; Johnston & Edmonds, 2009). Familiar faces appear
to be processed in a largely view and lighting-invariant manner, which is most likely a
consequence of an observer's previous experience of the face and the multiple views (and
possible variations of those views) stored for those faces (Burton, Jenkins, & Schweinberger,
2011). Unfamiliar face recognition, on the other hand, appears to be more closely tied to low-
level image information (Hancock et al., 2000; O'Toole, 2005), leaving it particularly
vulnerable to image variation. Many studies have shown that unfamiliar face perception
and recognition is viewpoint dependent (Hill, Schyns, & Akamatsu, 1997; Jeffery, Rhodes,
& Busey, 2006; Lee, Matsumiya, & Wilson, 2006; Liu, & Chaudhuri, 2002; Newell, Chiroro,
& Valentine, 1999; O'Toole, Edelman, & Bu
¨ lthoff, 1998; O'Toole, Vetter, & Blanz, 1999;
Troje & Bu
¨ lthoff, 1996; Wallraven, Schwaninger, Schuhmacher, & Bu
¨ lthoff, 2002) as well as
lighting dependent (Adini et al., 1997; Braje, 2003; Braje, Kersten, Tarr, & Troje, 1998; Hill &
Bruce, 1996; Johnston, Hill, & Carman, 1992; Tarr, Georghiades, & Jackson, 2008; Tarr,
Kersten, & Bulthoff, 1998). However, despite both lighting and viewpoint codetermining the
image, their combined effect has received considerably less attention. The aim of this article is
to investigate that relationship.
Our focus in this study is on cues to identity that are carried by differences in the 3D shape
of the face. While it is clear that surface reflectance (including pigmentation) is important for
recognition (O'Toole et al., 1999; Russell, Biederman, Nederhouser, & Sinha, 2007), we
concentrate on shape because it is the projection of the 3D shape of the face into two-
dimensional (2D) images that is primarily affected by lighting and viewing direction. The
interaction of viewing angle or lighting direction with the 3D shape of the face determines
which surfaces are visible and the 2D projections of those surfaces. The perception of surface
properties is based on how an observer interprets luminance variations in such images (e.g., as
being due to the presence of a contour, shading, surface pigmentation, or shadows) and will
affect their ability to recognise faces (Bruce & Langton, 1994; Kemp, Pike, White, &
Musselman, 1996; Liu, Collin, Burton, & Chaudhuri, 1999).
Lighting and viewpoint effects in face recognition implicate shape and shading
information as playing an important role in the representations that mediate face
perception. Hill and Bruce (1996) examined the combined effects of lighting and viewpoint
on performance matching 3D face shape. Faces (3D facial surfaces without colour or texture)
were rotated 0, 45 and 90 in depth about the vertical axis (yaw) with either top or bottom
lighting. Matching faces across yaw rotations of viewpoint was more accurate with top
2 i-Perception
lighting than bottom lighting and matching faces between changes in top lighting was more
accurate than between changes in bottom lighting. Top lighting relative to the observer did
not provide a benefit for matching inverted faces, suggesting that changes in viewpoint and
lighting have specific effects on face processing, beyond any general effect on pattern
matching. Hill and Bruce (1996) argue that their results could not be explained in terms of
image or edge differences and were consistent with top lighting assisting in the interpretation
of the 3D shape of face stimuli. However, alternative accounts based simply on our greater
experience with top-lit faces cannot be ruled out.
While Hill and Bruce (1996) showed that viewpoint effects depend on lighting direction
their research was focussed on the effects of lighting and limited to the effects of top or
bottom lighting on yaw rotation of faces. There are nontrivial differences between yaw
and pitch rotations of faces. While both types of depth rotation result in self-occlusion
(e.g., one cheek and half the jaw are largely occluded in yaw rotation and the forehead
occluded in pitch views from below), the bilateral symmetry of the face may allow for
occluded information in yaw rotations to be more easily recoverable (Troje & Bulthoff,
1996). The same argument could apply to lighting, another reason to compare both view
and lighting manipulations across both axes. The aim of this study was to do this: Factorially
examine the interaction between the effects of viewpoint and lighting within the yaw and
pitch axes of depth rotation. Research has shown that face recognition is viewpoint
dependent in each of 3D (yaw, pitch and roll) axes (Favelle, Palmisano, & Avery, 2011;
Favelle, Palmisano, & Maloney, 2007; Wallraven et al., 2002). Note, however, that both
the overall performance and rate of viewpoint decline depended on the axis of rotation
(Favelle et al., 2011). Specifically, performance on a face recognition task was best and
declined slowest for roll camera rotations and become poorer with increasingly steeper
declines for yaw, pitch-below and pitch-above camera rotations, respectively. Lighting was
primarily from above (including ambient lighting) and held constant with respect to the face
while the camera viewpoint was rotated. While this lighting was ecologically based, it could
be a factor in explaining Favelle et al.'s results. It is possible that the pattern of lighting on the
face may have been used an additional cue to recognition and the lighting was especially
detrimental to pitch view change compared with roll or yaw views. The findings of Hill and
Bruce (1996) and Favelle et al. (2007, 2011) together point to the need to investigate lighting
and viewpoint more closely in combination.
Analogies can be drawn between the effects of lighting and viewpoint. For example,
rotations of the face (or camera) in pitch are similar in some respects to the effect of
changing between top and bottom lighting as both correspond to rotations around the
mediolateral or horizontal axis of the head. Likewise, rotations of the face (or camera) in
yaw are analogous to changes from left to right side lighting as both involve rotations around
the vertical axis of the head. The surfaces visible from a particular viewpoint largely
correspond to the surfaces that would receive direct illumination if lit from that direction
and occluding contours correspond to attached shadow boundaries. In this study, we
examined both top or bottom and left or right lighting conditions with respect to head
and camera rotations about both pitch and yaw. We expected that performance would be
best with top lighting (Hill & Bruce, 1996; Johnston et al., 1992). However, if surface
information is important for successful matching then we would expect to find superior
performance in conditions lit from directly in front of the face since the pattern of light
remains constant and there are no shadows obscuring the surface. Comparing patterns of
performance in left or right versus top or bottom lighting conditions can test the extent to
which lighting may be treated as reflectance change. If the effect of lighting is based largely on
changes in luminance across the images, then patterns for left or right lighting should be
Favelle et al. 3
similar to top or bottom. The overall pattern of generalisation will provide information about
the relative importance of changes in view and lighting and about the extent to which these
depend on each other.
When considering the effect of view rotation with respect to face recognition, there are two
ways in which view rotation can occur. First, the observer is in a fixed position and the face or
head is rotated about a particular axis (with the origin of this rotation being at the observer).
Second, the face or head is in a fixed position and the observer's viewpoint instead moves or
rotates (with the origin of these rotations being the face). While the images produced by both
types of movement will have considerable overlap; there will be some important points of
difference. During head rotation, the light field will be uniform with respect to the observer
but the pattern of light and dark on the surface of the face will change. By contrast, during
observer movement, the pattern of light and dark on the surface of the face will remain
unchanged (as the light field is uniform with respect to the head). This distinction results in
2D image differences (compare Figures 1 and 6 or Figures 2 and 7) and would be particularly
important if the pattern of lighting on the face (as distinct from the pattern in the image) is
important for matching or subsequent recognition (e.g., a highlight on a particular facial
feature). This difference in the pattern of lighting has not been studied previously despite the
potential importance as a cue and variations across studies (i.e., head vs. camera rotation).
We test whether patterns of generalisation reflect this, hypothesising that if the pattern of
lighting on the surface is important for matching, camera rotations (Experiment 2) will be less
detrimental than head rotations (Experiment 1) as the former leaves these patterns
unchanged.
Finally, class-based knowledge is likely to be important for face recognition (Adini et al.,
1997). It is argued that faces are processed by a specialised face recognition system based on
findings of stronger inversion and composite effects, for example, for faces than for
objects (McKone, 2010; McKone & Robbins, 2011). Contrast reversal effects have also
been found to be greater for faces than objects (Nederhouser, Yue, Mangini, &
Biederman, 2007; Vuong, Peissig, Harrison, & Tarr, 2005) and present for identity but not
expression judgements (White, 2001). In order to determine whether there is a specialised role
for viewpoint and lighting in a dedicated face recognition system, we included inverted
conditions in Experiment 1. Russell et al. (2007) showed that face inversion disrupted the
use of shape and reflectance about equally. The presence of an inversion effect in this study
would suggest that matching across viewpoint and lighting depends on implicit knowledge of
upright faces.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we investigated the effect of head rotation on face matching. That is, the
camera remained fixed at a front view and the head and lighting rotated about both pitch and
yaw axes.
Method
Participants. Sixty-seven undergraduate psychology students from the University of
Wollongong served as participants for this experiment as a part of a course requirement.
Ethical approval for all experiments was obtained from the University of Wollongong
Human Research Ethics Committee, application HE08/067, in accordance with Australian
National guidelines. All participants gave informed consent with an approximate ratio of
4 i-Perception
male to female participants of 1:4. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and none
were familiar with the facial stimuli used in the experiment.
Stimuli. 3D models of synthetic faces were used to create the stimuli for all between- and
within-subject conditions. This gives ready control over viewpoint and lighting while keeping
shape and reflectance constant. A total of 180 synthetic faces were created from a pool of 54
real faces, 27 males and 27 females, recorded using a surface scanning device, NEC ``Fiore''
(Yip, Smith, & Yoshino, 2004; Yoshino, Matsuda, Kubota, Imaizumi, & Miyasaka, 2000).
This uses distortions of patterned light to recover shape and also records images of surface
texture. Correspondences between face scans were established using an automatic method
where each face was represented in terms of a mesh with 9,327 vertices (Claes, Vandermeulen,
De Greef, Willems, & Suetens, 2006). Face models were then rendered with a 3D modelling
software package, ``Blender'' version 2.45 (www.blender.com) using the Internal Raytracing
engine to generate 480 Â 480 JPEG images. All faces were rendered using an average texture
map to model reflectance. Only the face (and not the whole head) was rendered to restrict the
available information to the face. This is somewhat analogous to the use of an oval mask
used with photographic front views to remove hair and ear cues. The camera was 50 cm from
Figure 1. Examples of stimuli in which the head was rotated about the yaw axis (left column 45 leftwards,
middle column 0 and right column 45 rightwards) and lighting rotated about the yaw axis (top row 45
leftwards, middle row 0 and bottom row 45 rightwards).

the head and had a modelled 60 mm focal length. Lighting was sun type which is directional.
Energy was 1.5 Blender units and does not fall-off with distance for this type of modelled
light. Stimuli were presented on a Dell computer with a 17 in. screen using a program written
in Adobe Director.
For Experiment 1, the stimuli were created with the camera remaining fixed (at 0) with
front and three-quarter (45) head rotations and lighting rotations about both pitch and yaw
axes. View angles were combined factorially with lighting angles for each axis such that there
were nine different views for each axis (see Figures 1 and 2), including a common front-lit
front view of the face. Inverted stimuli were created by rotating the face images 180, thus,
bottom lighting becomes top lighting relative to the observer.
Procedure. The experiment took place in a dimly lit room. The experiment began with a set of
written instructions and a practice session using different faces shown under the same conditions.
The experiment consisted of 90 randomly ordered trials (10 trials per condition) in each of
which subjects were presented with a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) matching-to-
sample task. A self-paced break was given halfway through (i.e., after 45 trials). Each trial

began with a fixation cross appearing for 250 ms at the centre of the screen followed by a
single face presented for 1,500 ms. This face was replaced with a random noise pattern mask
appearing on the screen for 200 ms followed by a 300 ms blank screen and then followed by a
pair of test faces presented either side of the centre of the screen (no central fixation cross) for
2,000 ms which was also replaced with a random noise pattern mask. The mask remained on
the screen until a response was made. Participants were asked to decide which of the two test
faces was the same as the learned face, by responding left or right using the corresponding
arrow keys. The next trial began 1,000 ms after the subject made a response. No feedback was
given on response accuracy. The single learned face was always presented at light angle 0,
view angle 0. The two test faces were presented in the same view and lighting angle condition
as each other. The faces used in each trial, the side on which the target face appeared, the
vertical position of each of the two faces (Æ50 pixels) and the size of each face (63% or 83%
of learned face) was fully randomised. For trials in inverted conditions, both the learned and
test faces were presented in the inverted orientation.
Design. We used a four-factor design: 2 Orientation (upright and inverted) Â 2 Axis of
Rotation (yaw and pitch) Â 3 Light Angle (À45, 0, 45) Â 3 View Angle (À45, 0, 45).
The between-subject factors were orientation and axis resulting in four groups. Light angle
and view angle were manipulated within subjects. The 2AFC matching-to-sample task
involved deciding which of two test faces corresponded to the learned face ­ target faces
and paired distractor faces were chosen randomly for each participant separately from the
180 synthetic faces available without attempting to control for, but avoiding any bias
associated with, perceived attributes like sex, age or distinctiveness. There were 10 trials in
each condition giving a total of 3 Â 3 Â 10 ¼ 90 trials for each participant.
Results
Analyses were conducted on proportion correct face matching data.1 Pitch and yaw rotations
were analysed separately with 2 Orientation (upright or inverted) Â 3 Lighting Angle (À45,
0, 45) Â 3 Viewing Angle (À45, 0, 45) mixed-design analysis of variances (ANOVAs).
The  level was .05. All post hoc comparisons were Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise
comparisons (adjusted p values are reported). Where the assumption of sphericity was
violated a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. The number of participants in each
condition was as follows: upright yaw, 16; inverted yaw, 16; upright pitch, 19; and
inverted pitch, 16.
Yaw rotations. The three-way mixed-design ANOVA showed a main effect of the between-
subject factor of orientation, F(1, 30) ¼ 14.32, p < .001, 2
p
¼ .32. Matching accuracy was
significantly greater for upright (M ¼ .83, SD ¼ .08) than inverted (M ¼ .72, SD ¼ .08)
faces. There was also a significant Light Â View interaction, F(4, 120) ¼ 5.83, p < .001,
2
p
¼ .16, and main effect of View, F(2, 60) ¼ 14.91, p < .001, 2
p
¼ .33. None of the other
main effects or interactions was significant (all p's > .1).
Orientation did not interact with viewing or lighting angle but, since upright faces are of
primary interest and different groups of participants were involved, we analyse and graph
data for upright faces alone. As can be seen in Figure 3, participants were most accurate at
matching front views and changes in yaw lighting alone had less effect on performance than
changes in yaw view alone. Consistent with this a 3 (light angle) Â 3 (view angle) repeated
measures ANOVA for the upright face data revealed a significant effect of viewing angle,
F(2, 30) ¼ 8.36, p ¼ .004, 2
p
¼ .36, but not of lighting angle, F(2, 30) ¼ 2.2, p ¼ .12. Post hoc
Favelle et al. 7
comparisons showed that front views (M ¼ .89, SD ¼ .08) were matched more accurately than
views rotated 45 to the right (M ¼ .79, SD ¼ .11, p ¼ .007) or left (M ¼ .80, SD ¼ .10,
p < .001), but that there was no significant difference between the left and right rotated
views (p ¼ 1). There was no interaction between light and view, F(4, 60) ¼ 2.00, p ¼ .1.
Pitch rotations. As with yaw rotation analysis, the three-way mixed-design ANOVA on pitch
rotations showed a main effect of the between subjects factor of orientation, F(1, 33) ¼ 20.48,
p < .001, 2
p
¼ .38. Matching accuracy was again significantly greater for upright (M ¼ .77,
SD ¼ .06) than inverted (M ¼ .67, SD ¼ .07) faces. There was also a significant main effect of
pitch view, F(2, 66) ¼ 25.9, p < .001, 2
p
¼ .44, but not lighting angle F(2, 66) ¼ 0.43, p ¼ .65.
Orientation interacted with lighting angle, F(2, 66) ¼ 3.60, p ¼ .03, 2
p
¼ .10 (see Figure 4).
Post hoc comparisons showed that while accuracy was higher for upright than inverted
faces for both front and top lighting (p < .001 and p ¼ .001, respectively), there was
no significant effect of orientation for bottom-lit faces (p ¼ .23). Neither the orientation
by view interaction nor the three-way interaction with orientation was significant (both
p > .2).
A 3 (light angle) Â 3 (view angle) repeated measures ANOVA on upright faces revealed a
significant Light Â View interaction, F(4, 72) ¼ 5.00, p ¼ .001, 2
p
¼ .22, as well as significant
main effects of lighting, F(2, 36) ¼ 4.80, p ¼ .01, 2
p
¼ .21, and viewing angle, F(2, 36) ¼ 14.77,
p < .001, 2
p
¼ .45. Figure 5 shows how the effect of lighting conditions depended on head
rotation. Post hoc comparisons show that, when the face was rotated down (Figure 5 right),
there were no significant differences between lighting conditions (all p > .08). When the face
was viewed from the front, front lighting produces more accurate performance than either
bottom (p ¼ .01) or top (p ¼ .05) lighting which did not differ from each other. When the face
was rotated up, matching accuracy with lighting from above was significantly higher than
with lighting from below (p ¼ .001), but not significantly different to lighting from in front
(p ¼ .09). There was no significant difference between front and bottom lighting (p ¼ .23).

Discussion
We found an overall effect of inversion with greater accuracy in matching upright than
inverted faces. Analyses of the yaw data showed no interactions with orientation which
shows that the inversion effect was independent of changes in the yaw angles of lighting or
viewpoint. If the inversion effect is taken as an indicator of visual processes specific to upright
faces (e.g., Robbins & McKone, 2003; Rossion & Boremanse, 2008), then this result suggests
that the effects of yaw angle changes in view or lighting are not influenced by face-specific
processing. Orientation did interact with pitch rotations of lighting, but not view. Collapsing
across pitch views, matching performance was uniformly poor for inverted faces in all
lighting conditions. Critically, matching performance for bottom-lit upright and bottom-lit
inverted faces was equally as poor. That is, pitch-rotated views of faces that were bottom lit
(see bottom row of Figure 2) showed no inversion effect, while pitch-rotated views of faces
that were top or front lit (top and middle rows of Figure 2) showed typical inversion effects.
This indicates that findings in which bottom lighting has reduced the inversion effect for full
face views (Johnston et al., 1992) extend to pitch-rotated views of faces. Together with Hill
and Bruce's (1996) finding of a disadvantage for bottom lighting on matching across yaw
viewing angle changes (not tested here), this is further evidence that bottom lighting can be
detrimental to face processing. Because of the factorial combination of view and lighting in
the current experiment, we can show that the lighting effects for pitch rotations cannot be
accounted for simply by poor visibility of surface information. While top lighting can
facilitate performance for heads rotated up, there is no similar benefit of bottom lighting
for heads rotated down (see Figure 5). If the effect of pitch rotations in view were determined
by the features occluded this would not be expected to depend on lighting. Lighting also
determines feature visibility and performance is especially poor when lighting and view rotate
in opposite directions meaning that the visible surfaces do not receive direct lighting.
In Experiment 2, we further investigate the dependence of view on light while no longer
including conditions where lighting and viewing direction are orthogonal.
The results of Experiment 1 suggest that overall, the effects of changing view were of a
similar size for yaw and pitch (2
p
¼ .36 and .45 and Z2 ¼ .15 and .18, respectively), but that
their relation to lighting was different. There was no effect of yaw lighting changes, while the
effect of pitch rotations in lighting were significant, they were weaker than (2
p
¼ .21 and
Z2 ¼ .04) and depended on the view effects. Thus, the effects of rotation in view appear to
be stronger than that of equivalent rotations in lighting. There were effects of view in all
lighting conditions but the effect of lighting occurred only for some pitch-rotated views.
Accuracy was the highest for matching the front-lit front view face, which may not seem
surprising given that the reference face was also a front-lit front view. However, this identical
image benefit was not seen for the yaw trials when compared with changes in yaw lighting
direction which did not significantly affect matching performance despite introducing clearly
visible image differences (central column of Figure 1). Matching performance was best when
lighting and view emphasised front of face information (i.e., front view under any lighting and
conditions where view and light rotate in the same direction such that lighting comes directly
from in front of the face). This pattern appears more consistent with involvement of surface-
based coding (where surface information such as shading and shadow is represented in visual
memory for faces) than image- or edge-based encoding (Tarr et al., 1998 draw similar
conclusions for object recognition). We test the nature of surface-based coding further in
Experiment 2, specifically, whether illumination is represented in terms of its effect on the
image or whether it is represented more implicitly with respect to the surface and shape of
the face. When the head is rotated relative to a stationary and uniform light source, the pattern
10 i-Perception
of light and dark is not consistent with respect to the surface of the face. If consistency in the
pattern of light on a surface is important for face perception, then we might expect better
performance for viewpoint (as opposed to head) rotation conditions ­ since the light field is
uniform with respect to the head and the pattern of light and dark on the surface of the face
remains unchanged. To address this, we tested moving camera conditions in Experiment 2.
Experiment 2
It is not often the case that studies explicitly state whether images used as stimuli are created
by rotation of the object or by rotation of the camera. Here, we test whether it has a
systematic effect on performance. In Experiment 2, we investigated the effect of viewpoint
(camera as opposed to head) rotation on face matching. That is, the head remained fixed and
the camera and lighting rotated about pitch and yaw axes. In addition to testing whether the
consistency of the pattern of light on the surface is important for face perception, the issue of
image darkness is reduced. The rotated images created for this experiment (refer to Figures 6
and 7) are lighter compared with those in Experiment 1 (see Figures 1 and 2) and any
influence of image darkness per se may be revealed in cross experiment comparisons.2
Method
Participants. Thirty-one undergraduate psychology students from the University of
Wollongong served as participants for this experiment in exchange for course credit. The
approximate ratio of male to female participants was 1:4. All had normal or corrected-to-
normal vision and none were familiar with the facial stimuli used in the experiment.
Stimuli. Same as Experiment 1 except that the camera, and not the head, was rotated to create
the different viewing angle conditions. The head remained fixed (0) with camera rotations
(À45, 0 and 45) and lighting rotations (À45, 0 and 45) about the pitch and about the
yaw axes. View angles were combined with lighting angles for each axis such that there were
nine different views for each axis (see Figures 6 and 7). Orientation was not included as a
factor in this experiment; participants only saw upright faces.
Procedure. The procedure was the same as for upright conditions in Experiment 1.
Design. We used a three-factor design: 2 Axis of Rotation (yaw/pitch) Â 3 Light Angle (À45,
0, 45) Â 3 View Angle (À45, 0, 45). The between-subject factor was axis. Light angle and
view angle were manipulated within subjects. In this experiment, all faces were presented
upright.

there were no differences between lighting conditions when the camera was rotated to the left

with front lighting was significantly more accurate than with left lighting (p ¼ .02) but there
was no difference between right and front lighting or between right and left lighting (both

accurately than either the left or the right views (all p < .05). However, while there was no
difference between the left and right views with left or with right lighting conditions (both

camera rotated up condition, there were no significant differences between lighting levels (all
p > .90). In the camera front and camera rotated down conditions, matching was better for
front lighting than either top or bottom lighting (all p < .05). Further, while a front view of
the face produced most accurate performance in all lighting conditions, the patterns varied
such that lighting and view appeared to be somewhat compensatory. That is, performance
was partially facilitated when lighting and view were from the same direction.
Rotated head compared with rotated camera. Because camera rotation leaves the pattern of
lighting on the surface of the face unchanged, we hypothesised that camera rotations
(Experiment 2) would be less detrimental to matching performance than head rotations
(Experiment 1). We tested performance across experiment groups for pitch and yaw
rotations with (a) two separate mixed ANOVAs comparing equivalent image conditions
and (b) independent samples t tests comparing unique image conditions. Of the nine image
conditions created for each axis of rotation, seven are equivalent with respect to the
Figure 7. Examples of stimuli in which the camera was rotated about the pitch axis (left column 45 below

experiments where performance was best for front views regardless of lighting and poorer
for left or right views. A similar analysis of the pitch conditions also revealed only a
significant main effect of view, F(6, 192) ¼ 13.63, p < .01, 2

the individual experiments where performance was best for front view with front lighting and
worst for views from above. Neither the main effect of experiment nor the interaction was
significant, both F < 1.25, p > .29.
Because we cannot match the unique views across experiments, the average of these two
views was compared in Bonferroni-corrected independent samples t tests. For yaw rotations,
the matching accuracy for unique views in the rotated head experiment (M ¼ .75, SD ¼ .09)
was not significantly different to the rotated camera experiment, M ¼ .78, SD ¼ .12; t(30) < 1,
p ¼ .51. Similarly, the matching accuracy of the two unique pitch views in the rotated head
experiment (M ¼ .66, SD ¼ .10) was not significantly different than the mean accuracy of the
two unique views in the rotated camera experiment, M ¼ .71, SD ¼ .08; t(32) ¼ 1.45, p ¼ .16.
In summary, the comparison of performance across the two experiments showed no support
of the hypothesis that camera rotations would be less detrimental to matching performance
than head rotations.
General Discussion
Regardless of whether the rotations involved the head (Experiment 1) or the camera
(Experiment 2), patterns of face matching accuracy as a function of view and lighting were
similar, but distinct for the yaw and pitch rotation axes. Matching faces across changes in
yaw rotations of view and lighting showed strong effects of viewpoint change with little to no
effect of lighting. However, in the case of pitch rotations, changes in lighting and view each
impaired performance and these effects interacted. While lighting affected matching accuracy
for front views and views from below, there was no effect of lighting for faces viewed from
above. Specifically, we found (a) matching front views was more accurate with front lighting
than top or bottom lighting and (b) matching views from below was more accurate with
bottom or front lighting than with top lighting. That is, generalisation was typically better
across views when the source of light was directly (or close to directly) in front of the face.
A face inversion effect, where participants were poorer at matching inverted compared with
upright faces, was found in Experiment 1. The inversion effect was independent of both yaw

and pitch view changes and was seen across all yaw lighting angles; however, the inversion
effect interacted with pitch lighting and was evident only for faces lit from above or the front.
The presence of the face inversion effect indicates face-specific processing (Robbins &
McKone 2003; Rossion & Boremanse, 2008; Valentine, 1998). In this study, face inversion
effects were found in matching across all pitch and yaw views and all yaw lighting conditions.
These results show that matching even unfamiliar faces is not simply determined by image
similarity (which does not change with orientation) and suggests a role for class based
knowledge. Notably, while face inversion effects were found for top- and front-lit pitch
views, no inversion effect was found for pitch view of faces with bottom lighting. As can
be seen in Figure 4, bottom lighting was detrimental to matching accuracy for upright faces
rather than providing an advantage to inverted faces. That is, the lack of an inversion effect in
this case is a result of bottom lighting affecting upright (and not inverted) face processing.
The face inversion effect has been argued to be due to an inability to process configural cues
from inverted faces (Freire, Lee, & Symons, 2000; Leder & Bruce, 2000), thus, the detrimental
effect of bottom lighting on face matching may also be due to a disruption to the processing
of configural information cues. Bottom lighting has also been shown to disproportionately
impair use of cues for 3D shape (Hill & Bruce, 1996; Johnston et al., 1992). While we cannot
rule out the possibility that we may simply be more familiar or experienced at face perception
in front- and top-lit conditions, together these results suggest that front and top lighting
facilitates configural and 3D shape processing for faces. Subsequent discussion is restricted to
upright faces.
The results of Experiment 1 showed that left and right yaw rotation of the head reduced
matching performance but yaw rotation of lighting angle did not. Head rotation changes
outline, aspect ratios and shape of projected features which lighting does not. Changing yaw
lighting had no effect on performance despite introducing changes to the image (via light
patterns on the face). However, while there were head rotation effects in pitch, changes in
pitch lighting angle also affected face matching performance in a way that yaw changes did
not. The bilateral symmetry of the face is clearly critical. The pattern of lighting on the lit side
of the face in the case of yaw rotations supports accurate matching. There is substantial
overlap between front images with yaw-rotated lighting (see centre columns of Figures 1 or 6)
and the reference image where half of the yaw lit face is nearly identical to the reference
image. This, plus the use of virtual views (Troje & Bu
¨ lthoff, 1996) to compensate for
information obscured by shadow, could account for the lack of lighting effect. The pattern
of light resulting from rotations in pitch lighting, however, provides no overlap with the
reference image (see centre columns of Figure 2 or 7) and virtual views are of no use given the
bilateral symmetry of the face. A novel finding is the interaction between view and lighting
effects in pitch. While there is better matching performance for front-lit front views and
top-lit views of the head rotated up, there is no effect of lighting when the head is rotated
down. Bottom lighting in this case results in front-of-face lighting and high surface visibility.
Top lighting, although orthogonal to viewing direction, provides outline information of the
nose and brows which are the more prominent features in this view. Further, no difference
between top and bottom lighting rules out a general explanation of lighting effects in terms of
a light-from-above assumption.
In Experiment 2, view was manipulated as a change in camera viewpoint rather than head
rotation. Despite different effects on the image (e.g., the introduction of internal cast shadows
and the overall darkness), matching performance did not vary significantly across
experiments suggesting that information regarding the pattern of lighting on the face
is not critical for matching. With regard to yaw rotations, again there was an effect
of a change in view and no effect of a change in lighting; however, there was a significant
16 i-Perception
interaction between lighting and view as a change in camera rotation. There was no effect of
light for front- or left-rotated camera views, but there were differential effects of lighting for
right-rotated camera views. That is, the pattern of light on the face is important for matching
right-rotated camera views but not others. General surface visibility cannot account for this
result since left-rotated camera views saw good matching performance even when view and
lighting were orthogonal. Since this view sees the majority of the face information on the left
hand side of the image (see Figure 6 right hand column), and there is evidence of a left visual
field bias in face perception (e.g., Burt & Perrett, 1997; Gilbert & Balkan, 1973), it is possible
that lighting had a greater effect in right-rotated camera views where face processing may be
relatively dominant. This can only be a partial explanation, however, since a similar finding
was not made in Experiment 1 and further research would be needed to test this idea.
The effect of changes to view and lighting in pitch was very similar for camera and head
rotations (see Figures 5 and 9). Again, matching was impaired by rotating the camera view
from the front view. Changes in pitch lighting alone affected matching performance (which
was never found for yaw lighting) and the effects of lighting and view interacted. While
matching performance was better for lighting from in front of the face for front views and
views from below, there was no effect of lighting for views from above. A difference in the
pattern of lighting effects between camera and head rotation on views from below suggests a
role for surface information. When the head was viewed from below as a result of the head
being rotated up, we found typical lighting effects where top lighting produced better
performance than bottom lighting. However, when the head was viewed from below as a
result of the camera being rotated down, top lighting resulted in the worst performance.
Notably, it was conditions in which faces were lit from an in-front-of-face source (providing
most surface information) that lead to best performance in pitch conditions.
Overall, this study shows overall stronger viewpoint effects than lighting effects in a
matching task. This asymmetry reflects patterns found in face learning studies. Liu,
Bhuiyan, Ward, and Sui (2009) showed that learning faces at multiple poses (yaw
rotations between 0 Æ 62) resulted in better transfer to a new lighting condition (left vs.
right lighting) than learning a single pose. However, no such benefit was found for learning a
face in multiple lighting conditions. They concluded that while viewpoint training can
compensate for lighting variation, lighting conditions may only prove useful for a trained
viewpoint. That is, viewpoint processing plays a stronger role in image-invariant face
recognition than does lighting. But in their study, viewpoint and lighting were manipulated
only in the yaw axis. While along with this study, these findings point to viewpoint encoding
as a primary mechanism in compensating for major image variations in both face matching
and learning, we also show that where lighting does have an effect, the direction matters.
One limitation of this work is the use of synthetic faces as stimuli. Synthetic faces were
used as they allowed us best control over the lighting and view angles as well as surface and
texture information. While synthetic faces are not the same as and may be processed less
efficiently than photographic images, there is evidence that they treated in a qualitatively
similar manner in perceptual tasks (Balas & Pacella, 2015; Crookes et al., 2015; Matheson &
McMullen, 2011). We also acknowledge that any conclusions are limited to situations in
which the reference image is a front-lit front view of a face. Further research is needed to test
generalisability to other reference image conditions.
This study has a focus on changes in pitch view, which despite their increasing relevance in
surveillance situations are still much less studied than changes in yaw. Previous research has
shown that face recognition is poorest in pitch views from above compared with pitch views
from below and that both of these are poorer than yaw or roll views (Favelle et al., 2007, 2011),
but these studies used ideal lighting (top and ambient front lighting) that may have
Favelle et al. 17
disadvantaged recognition from pitch viewpoints. The results reported here show that the
effects of pitch view rotation do depend on light. Specifically, matching pitch views from
below may be facilitated by lighting that is at least approximately in front of the face,
whereas there are no lighting effects when matching pitch views from above. The strength of
this study is in the factorial combination of lighting and viewpoint angle in yaw and pitch
separately. By making the same geometric manipulations to lighting and viewpoint in yaw as in
pitch, we have shown that even though the only difference between the images in yaw and pitch
groups is direction (up or down rotation vs. left or right) there are clear differences in the
pattern of matching performance. Finally, a significant aspect of this study is the comparison
of head versus camera rotation in creating face images, a factor not previously directly
addressed in research. We show that lighting cues are exploited equally well regardless of
whether the light field is uniform with respect to the surfaces of the head (camera rotation)
or the pattern of light and dark changes across the surface of the face (head rotation). While
clear indication of the nature of the rotation in describing methods is ideal, our results suggest
that it is not likely to systematically affect results.
Conclusions
Viewpoint and illumination change represent an important challenge for any visual system,
human or computer algorithm, functioning in real-world conditions (O'Toole, 2005). Despite
apparent similarities in the way that lighting and viewpoint changes affect an image, we have
shown that there are clear differences in the way that these image factors affect face matching
performance and that the axis of rotation matters. In line with previous research, we show
that face perception is viewpoint dependent across both pitch and yaw axes. Critically,
however, the effects of viewpoint changes in pitch are dependent on top or bottom
lighting. Yaw (left or right rotations) manipulations of lighting angle had no significant
effect alone and minimal effect on viewpoint dependence, despite surface pattern changes
being just as large as for pitch manipulations of lighting angles. Thus, we can conclude that
lighting effects are not being treated as a simple change in reflectance in face perception;
image and edge differences cannot easily account for these findings. Rather, face perception
appears to rely on representation of surface shape information and is particularly sensitive to
the presence of top lighting, and not yaw lighting.

Peter Claes has obtained a PhD in engineering in June 2007, within
the field of medical image computing at the KU Leuven, Belgium.
During his PhD he developed a computer-based craniofacial
reconstruction approach for victim identification purposes. After
his PhD, he established his own research trajectory and vision,
with fundamental interest in pattern recognition and predictive
modeling within computational imaging and biology. He was a
Post-Doc at the, Melbourne Dental School, University of
Melbourne, Australia, until January 2011. Currently, he's
appointed as honorary fellow at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Australia and
as research expert at the KU Leuven, ESAT/PSI/MIC, Belgium. The basis of his line of
research lies in computer vision and medical image analysis with gained and proven
extensions in biostatistics, genetics, human biology and disease as well as cognitive
psychology.
