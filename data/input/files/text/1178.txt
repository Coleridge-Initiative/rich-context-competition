Objective: To test the independent effect of television
exposure in preschool-aged children on overweight risk.
Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Develop-
ment.
Setting: Ten US sites.
Participants: One thousand sixteen children selected
via conditional random sampling.
Main Exposure: Being awake in the room with the tele-
vision on for 2 hours or more per day, by maternal re-
port at age 36 months.
Main Outcome Measures: Child overweight (body
mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters] 95th percentile) calcu-
lated from measured anthropometrics at ages 36 and 54
months. Covariates tested included child sex and race; ma-
ternal marital status, education, age, and depressive symp-
toms; income-needs ratio, child behavior problems; Home
Observation for Measurement of the Environment total
score; hours per week in nonparental care; and propor-
tion of television exposure that was educational.
Results: At age 36 months, 5.8% of children were over-
weight; at age 54 months, 10.0% were overweight. Expo-
sure to 2 or more hours of television per day was associ-
ated with an increased risk of overweight at both age 36
months (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-
6.24) and age 54 months (odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confi-
denceinterval,1.03-2.83)inunadjustedanalyses.Onlyma-
ternalagealteredtheconcurrentrelationship,andtheeffect
of television remained significant (odds ratio, 2.61; 95%
confidence interval, 1.21-5.62). Television exposure at age
36 months was no longer a significant predictor of over-
weight at age 54 months when controlling for covariates.
Conclusion: Excessive television exposure is a risk fac-
tor for overweight in preschoolers independent of a num-
ber of potential confounders associated with the quality
of the home environment.

EXCESSIVE TELEVISION (TV)
viewing has been linked to
a variety of adverse out-
comes in children.1,2 The re-
lationship between TV view-
ing and overweight risk has been more
thoroughly described in school-aged3-10
than in preschool-aged11-17 children, and
only 2 studies in preschoolers control for
important potential confounders.12,13 The
American Academy of Pediatrics recom-
mends that total media time be limited to
less than 2 hours per day in children aged
2 years and older.2 Helping families achieve
this goal requires more information, in-
cluding whether the relationship is con-
founded by family characteristics that have
not been previously controlled, such as
overall quality of the home environment
or maternal depressive symptoms. In ad-
dition, the relationship in US children has
been evaluated only in low-income
groups,13 who watch significantly more
television.18 It is possible that the relation-
ship may be stronger in low-income popu-
lations or that important confounders of
the relationship are present to a greater de-
gree in low-income families. Excessive tele-
vision viewing in preschoolers may also
simply be a marker for an understimulat-
ing home environment, which has been in-
dependently linked to overweight risk.19
The present study seeks to address these
gaps in the current literature. We inves-
tigate the relationship between television
exposure and overweight risk in an age
range in which there are limited data and
in socioeconomic strata of the United
States in which it has not previously been
studied in large samples. We control for
a number of covariates that have not pre-
viously been available and examine both
the cross-sectional and longitudinal rela-
tionships between television exposure and

overweight risk. We hypothesized that a relationship be-
tween excessive television exposure and overweight risk
would be present both cross-sectionally and longitudi-
nally, but that it would be confounded by markers of qual-
ity of the home environment.
METHODS
The sample was composed of children and their parents en-
rolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human De-
velopment Study of Early Child Care and Youth Develop-
ment.20 This is a longitudinal study of relations between child
behavior and development, particularly in relation to child care
experience. Families were recruited shortly after the birth of a
child in 1991 from 10 areas of the United States, both urban
and rural. Details of the recruitment methods and sampling plan
are available elsewhere.21 The initial sample included 1364 chil-
dren and was representative of the demographics of the catch-
ment areas from which the sample was recruited.20 We exam-
ined the cross-sectional relationship between television exposure
and overweight risk with data collected at age 36 months and
the longitudinal relationship with data collected at ages 36 and
54 months. This study was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of all pertinent institutions.
Ouroutcomemeasureinthecross-sectionalanalysiswasover-
weight status at age 36 months. We evaluated 3 outcome mea-
sures in the longitudinal analysis: overweight status at age 54
months; incidence of new cases of overweight between the ages
of 36 and 54 months; and change in body mass index (BMI), cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height
in meters, between the ages of 36 and 54 months.22 Height and
weight were measured during the laboratory visits at ages 36 and
54 months by trained research assistants.23 Body mass index was
calculated and child overweight defined dichotomously as a BMI
greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex based
on National Center for Health Statistics norms.24
Mothers reported hours of TV exposure by questionnaire
when the child was aged 36 months, describing 2 weekdays
(Tuesday and Wednesday) and 2 weekend days for each of the
three 6-hour time blocks between 6 AM and midnight in 15-
minute increments. Television exposure was defined as "being
awake in the room when the television is on" and included both
broadcast and cable television as well as videos.25 The mean±SD
television exposure on weekdays (3.61±2.53 hours) and on
weekends (3.58±2.67 hours) were correlated (r=0.75, P.001).
We indexed average daily TV exposure by multiplying mean
weekday exposure by 5, summing this with mean weekend ex-
posure, and dividing by 7. Given that the American Academy
of Pediatrics recommends less than 2 hours of media expo-
sure per day,1,2 we dichotomized our predictor to "less than 2
hours of television per day" vs "greater than or equal to 2 hours
of television per day" to simplify interpretation of the results.
Demographic data consisted of the child's sex, the child's race/
ethnicity ("white" or "not white"), maternal marital status
("single" vs "not"), years of maternal education, and maternal
age. Additional characteristics hypothesized to modify an asso-
ciation between TV exposure and overweight were often avail-
able only for a subset of subjects and were therefore tested as
potential covariates separately from the main analysis. Parents
reported average hours per day in nonparental care via tele-
phoneinterviewevery3months,andwecalculatedaveragehours
perdayinnonparentalcarebetweentheagesof24and36months
(n=1016). Maternal depressive symptoms were indexed with the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (n=928), one
of the most widely used and validated measures of depressive
symptomatology, which asks respondents to self-report the fre-
quency of 20 depressive symptoms. Potential scores range from
0 to 60, with higher scores reflecting more depressive symp-
toms and scores greater than 16 reflecting a high risk for a clini-
cal diagnosis of depression.26
The income-to-needs ratio (n=912) is the ratio of total fam-
ily income relative to the poverty line for a family of a particu-
lar size. A family with an income-to-needs ratio less than 1 is
considered "poor." Child behavioral problems were indexed
with the Child Behavior Checklist (n=1014), a 99-item rating
scale that is the most widely used assessment of behavioral prob-
lems in young children.27 Scores are presented as T scores that
have a mean of 50 with a standard deviation of 15. A cut-off of
70 is frequently used to denote clinically significant behav-
ioral problems. The quality of the home environment was mea-
sured by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Envi-
ronment (HOME) (n=996), one of the most widely used indices
of the quality and quantity of stimulation and support avail-
able to a child in the home. Information is obtained during a
home visit via observation and interview. It is composed of 55
items, each of which is scored in a binary fashion (yes/no), with
scores therefore ranging from 0 to 55 and higher scores indi-
cating higher-quality home environments. The HOME has con-
sistently been correlated with cognitive, language, achieve-
ment, and social-emotional outcomes.28
We included an index of educational TV exposure based on
the hypothesis that educational programming is higher qual-
ity and would therefore potentially promote healthier eating
habits and exercise or, at a minimum, limit exposure to un-
healthy advertising messages. Parents reported, in the same for-
mat described earlier, exposure to 6 programs comprising a sig-
nificant proportion of children's programming on the Public
Broadcasting Service in the early 1990s.25 Mean±SD daily edu-
cational TV exposure (1.70±1.68 hours) was correlated with
average daily total TV exposure (3.59±2.50 hours) (r=0.64,
P.001). We calculated the proportion of total daily TV ex-
posure that was educational (n=917).
All data analysis was performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC). We excluded children without data for tele-
vision exposure (n=267) or BMI at age 36 months (n=273).
We examined the sample included in our model (n=1016) vs
those excluded because of missing data (n=348) and found sig-
nificant differences. Neither average daily TV exposure nor over-
weight prevalence at age 36 months differed significantly in those
with and without complete data (P=.51 and P=.67, respec-
tively). Children included in the sample compared with those
excluded were more likely to be white (82.8% vs 73.6%, P.001)
and had mothers who were more educated (14.4 vs 13.7 years,
P.001). We tested the location of data collection (each of the
10 sites) as a variable in the final model, as well as its interac-
tion term, and found these to be nonsignificant.
Univariate statistics were first computed to provide a descrip-
tion of the sample of 1016 children. Then, bivariate analyses were
performed to inform the development of the multiple logistic re-
gression models. We analyzed all covariates by TV exposure (2
hours per day vs 2 hours per day) using t tests for continuous
variables and cross tabulations with 2 tests for categorical vari-
ables. We sought to confirm the utility of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics­defined cut point of fewer than 2 hours of tele-
vision per day and therefore performed a logistic regression
analysis evaluating the relationship between TV exposure and
overweight risk at age 36 months by quartile of average daily TV
exposure (with cut points at 1.75, 3.00, and 4.90 hours per day).
All remaining analyses use TV exposure (2 hours per day vs
2 hours per day) as the primary predictor.
To evaluate the cross-sectional relationship between TV ex-
posure and overweight risk at age 36 months, we first created
a logistic regression model adjusting for the demographic co-
variates sex; race/ethnicity; and maternal marital status, edu-

cation, and age simultaneously. Second, a base model was cre-
ated using maximum likelihood ratios to derive the most
parsimonious model with the best fit for the demographic co-
variates (sex; race/ethnicity; and maternal marital status, edu-
cation, and age). Doing so allowed us to limit the number of
covariates included simultaneously in the model, thereby main-
taining the stability of the model when the additional covari-
ates of interest were tested. After this base model was identi-
fied, we tested additional covariates, most of which were only
available for a subset of the sample, each individually in the
model as potential confounders. These were hours per day in
nonparental care, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion scale score, income-needs ratio, Child Behavior Check-
list total score, HOME score, and proportion of TV exposure
that was educational.
To evaluate the longitudinal relationship between TV ex-
posure at age 36 months and overweight risk at age 54 months,
we repeated the analysis described earlier but with overweight
status at age 54 months as the outcome (both with and with-
out BMI z score at age 36 months as a covariate in the model).
We also evaluated incidence (new cases of overweight emerg-
ing between the ages 36 and 54 months) as an outcome. We
evaluated change in BMI between the ages 36 and 54 months
using multiple linear regression and the Mallows Cp crite-
rion29 to identify the most parsimonious model for this con-
tinuous outcome.
We computed both unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios
(ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
from the logistic regression models. We used a P value of less
than .05 (2-tailed) to determine statistical significance.
RESULTS
The sample included 1016 children. About half of the
sample was male and 5.5% were overweight (BMI 95th
percentile).30,31 Fewer than one third (31.7%) of chil-
dren were exposed to less than 2 hours of TV per day. In
bivariate analyses, 2 or more hours of television expo-
sure per day was associated with families who were less
likely to be white; were more likely to be headed by single
mothers; had lower income-needs ratios, lower HOME
scores, and a lower proportion of television exposure that
was educational; and had less educated, younger moth-
ers with more depressive symptoms. Children exposed
to 2 or more hours of TV per day had more reported be-
havior problems. Child sex and hours in nonparental care
were not related to TV exposure (Table 1).
TELEVISION EXPOSURE AT AGE 36 MONTHS
AND CONCURRENT OVERWEIGHT STATUS
Bivariate analyses showed that children who were ex-
posed to 2 or more hours of TV per day were signifi-
cantly more likely to be overweight than children ex-
posed to less than 2 hours of TV per day (P=.004)
(Table 1). We first evaluated the unadjusted risk of over-
weight in each quartile of TV exposure in a cross-
tabulation and found higher risk of overweight in quar-
tiles 2 through 4 in comparison with children watching
1.75 or fewer hours of TV per day (TV exposure in quar-
tile 1). We found that 2.0% of those in the first quartile
(least TV exposure) were overweight, compared with 5.6%
in the second quartile, 5.8% in the third quartile, and 8.8%
in the fourth quartile (greatest amount of TV expo-
sure). We estimated this relationship in logistic regres-
sion models. Using quartile 1 as a reference, each of the
3 other quartiles conferred additional obesity risk in the
unadjusted analysis (P=.02): quartile 2, OR, 2.98, 95%
CI, 1.06-8.40; quartile 3, OR, 3.06, 95% CI, 1.10-8.55;
and quartile 4, OR, 4.87, 95% CI, 1.81-13.06. Over-
weight risk did not differ significantly between quartiles
2, 3, and 4. In summary, results of the quartile analysis
supported dichotomizing TV exposure by the American
Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, and we proceeded with
additional analyses using this dichotomous variable as
the predictor in our models.
A relationship between 2 or more hours of TV expo-
sure per day and overweight at age 36 months was pre-
sent in the unadjusted analysis (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.36-
6.24). In the unadjusted analyses, both maternal age and
income-needs ratio were found to be associated with over-
weight while maternal education and marital status ap-
proached statistical significance (Table 2). In the ad-
justed analysis controlling for all demographic covariates
(sex; race; and maternal education, marital status, and
age) simultaneously, a relationship between TV expo-
sure and overweight at age 36 months persisted (Table 2).
In the analysis resulting from using the maximum like-
lihood ratio to derive the most parsimonious model, both
watching 2 or more hours of TV per day (OR, 2.61; 95%
CI, 1.21-5.62) and maternal age (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-
0.995) predicted overweight at age 36 months. We tested
for the presence of an interaction between TV exposure
and maternal age and it was not statistically significant,

indicating that the relationship between TV exposure and
overweight did not differ based on maternal age. Per our
analytic plan, we next tested each additional covariate
(hours per day in nonparental care, maternal depressive
symptoms, income-needs ratio, child behavior prob-
lems, quality of the home environment, and proportion
of TV exposure that was educational) individually in the
model with TV exposure and maternal age. None of these
covariates were statistically significant in these models,
nor did they significantly alter the relationship between
TV exposure and overweight risk at age 36 months.
TELEVISION EXPOSURE AT AGE 36 MONTHS
AND FUTURE OVERWEIGHT STATUS
AT AGE 54 MONTHS
Data regarding TV exposure at age 36 months and an-
thropometric data at age 54 months were available for
946 of 1016 subjects. Of these 946, 10% were over-
weight at age 54 months. In the unadjusted analysis, 2
or more hours of TV exposure per day predicted over-
weight status at age 54 months (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.03-
2.83). After adjusting for demographic covariates (sex;
race; and maternal education, marital status, and age),
however, the main effect of TV exposure became non-
significant. The most parsimonious model predicting over-
weight at age 54 months created using maximum like-
lihood ratios included only maternal education. Television
exposure was not statistically significant in the model.
Anthropometric data were available at both ages 36
and 54 months for 893 children. Of the 852 children who
were not overweight at age 36 months, 62 became over-
weight by age 54 months. Watching 2 or more hours of
TV per day did not predict the new onset of overweight
at age 54 months in the unadjusted analysis (OR, 0.74;
95% CI, 0.42-1.32), nor did it predict the change in BMI
from ages 36 to 54 months in the unadjusted analysis
(P=.39).
COMMENT
Results indicated that being awake in a room with a tele-
vision on for 2 or more hours per day at age 36 months
was independently associated with an increased concur-
rent risk of overweight. To our knowledge, this study is
the first to investigate the relationship between exces-
sive TV exposure and childhood overweight in a pre-
school-aged sample with geographic, ethnic, and socio-
economicdiversitywhileanalyticallycontrollingforalarge
number of potentially confounding factors. Children who
watched 2 or more hours of TV per day had more be-
havior problems and mothers with more depressive symp-
toms as well as significantly less stimulating home en-
vironments. Excessive TV exposure was not simply a
marker for these factors but was a significant indepen-
dent risk factor for childhood overweight during the pre-
school age range. Neither spending time outside of pa-
rental care nor watching educational TV muted the effect
of excessive TV exposure on overweight.
Television exposure at age 36 months did not predict
overweight risk at age 54 months. Given prior data that
TV exposure increases throughout childhood,18 it is un-
likely that TV exposure in our sample decreased over time,
although we do not have these data and cannot confirm
this supposition. Given that maternal education was the
most powerful predictor of overweight risk at age 54
months, we hypothesize that other risk factors con-
nected to socioeconomic status or maternal cognitive func-
tioning may overwhelm the contributing effect of TV ex-
posure. Some of these factors presumably have a
cumulative effect over childhood and may only begin to
overwhelm the robust effect of TV exposure as children
age. These may include maternal feeding behaviors,32 ma-
ternal weight status,33 family dietary choices,34 and ex-
ercise patterns.35 Studies that have detected a longitudi-
nal relationship between TV exposure and overweight

risk have also had larger sample sizes with longer fol-
low-up than our study had.12
Our findings on correlates of excessive TV exposure
mirror prior work12,13,18 in that children from disadvan-
taged environments watch more television. Despite the
previously documented associations between behavior
problems, TV exposure, and overweight risk,36-38 the re-
lationship between TV exposure and overweight risk was
not accounted for by child behavior problems. Al-
though depression is associated with increased TV ex-
posure39 and obesity40 in adults, and maternal depres-
sion is associated with increased TV exposure in
preschool-aged children,41 the relationship between ex-
cessive TV exposure and overweight risk was not ac-
counted for by maternal depressive symptoms. Over-
weight risk has been associated with understimulating
home environments in older children,19 but TV expo-
sure is an independent risk factor for overweight in pre-
school children, regardless of the overall quality of the
home environment.
The mechanism of effect of TV exposure on over-
weight risk is undoubtedly multifactorial. Prior studies
indicate that it appears to operate independently from
reduced physical activity.15 Excessive TV exposure may
instead operate through the extensive advertising mes-
sages for unhealthy foods targeted at very young chil-
dren42 or from a tendency of children to snack while
watching TV. Although educational TV exposure did not
mute the effect of excessive total TV exposure on over-
weight risk, this may be because educational television
in the United States does not equate with the absence of
advertising for unhealthy foods.43 Therefore, it remains
possible that even the limited advertising on public edu-
cational television for children may be 1 mechanism of
effect. Finally, our measure of TV exposure deserves com-
ment. Being awake in the room with the television on is
a broadly defined measure as compared with "watching
television." Such an index is developmentally appropri-
ate for children in this age range, given that children this
age rarely actually sit watching the television with no other
activity for prolonged periods of time. Our findings sug-
gest that exposing children to TV even as "background
noise" while they engage in other activities may in-
crease overweight risk. It may be equally relevant in clini-
cal practice to ask parents how often the child is in the
presence of a TV that is "on" as it is to ask how much
time the child spends "watching TV."
Our study has several limitations. Our sample size of
overweight children was relatively small; therefore, the
power to detect some effects may have been limited. Data
regarding physical activity, diet, or maternal obesity were
not available, which limits our ability to evaluate poten-
tial mechanisms of association. In addition, the cross-
sectional nature of our analysis at age 36 months limits
the ability to infer causation. Finally, as with many stud-
ies of this nature, the sample with complete data in-
cluded in our analysis differed from the sample without
complete data and therefore our findings may not be valid
to generalize to the reference population of the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study
of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Although
we tested covariates that are predictors of missingness
in the model and they did not alter the results, it re-
mains possible that our results would have differed had
complete data for the entire sample been available.
These data show a significant relationship between ex-
posure to 2 or more hours of television per day at age 36
months and concurrent overweight, independent of a va-
riety of demographic factors, child behavior problems,
maternal depressive symptoms, amount of time spent in
nonparental care, and proportion of TV exposure that is
educational. These results provide further support for the
utility of discussing television exposure during the well-
child examination in the preschool years and before. The
longitudinal results support the need to evaluate how low
maternal educational level may shape the preschooler's
environment to increase overweight risk. Although re-
duced TV exposure is a message that should be pro-
vided to all families, broadly based prevention and in-
tervention efforts may best be placed in disadvantaged
populations. School-based intervention programs have
effectively reduced TV exposure and BMI in older chil-
dren,44,45 but to our knowledge, there are no randomized
controlled trials assessing such interventions in preschool-
